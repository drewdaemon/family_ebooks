and fishing, golf, bowling, raising flowers and a
vegetable garden (when there is room); also car-
pentry and do-it-yourself projects. Among other
things I built the garage we had on our first Ameri-
can Fork place. I have become more active in the
church recently and now go home teaching. We
like our ward here, ''

As I looked at this gentle, sweet dispositioned
young man in his late thirties, light complexioned
with curly hair beginning to recede a little, I thought
how much like his grandfather Christensen he was,
Rather short but sturdily built; yes, he was his
grandfather's boy. I thought also that here was a
self-made successful man who was gathering the
good things of life around him - a fine home, a nice
car, a lovely family, and conveniences to make
them happy. He was finding time to work in the
church and to indulge some of his many hobbies,
along with his family.

LaMar took up a new hobby. He bought
himself a motorcycle. On Sunday July 28, 1968,
after dinner, he felt a little under the weather and
decided to take a little ride to get some air; He
got on his motorcycle and headed toward Alpine.
Sometime later his machine struck a railroad
track and he was thrown off onto his head. He
was rushed to a nearby Murray hospital and his
family was summoned. But he never regained
consciousness and died that night about 9. p.m, in
the hospital there, Funeral services were held
for him in the American Fork Third Ward chapel
the following Thursday at |l1 a,m. and he was
buried in the Nephi, Utah cemetery beside some.
of his wife's people.

His wife, Georgina Ockey, was born 17 Apr.
1929, in Nephi, Juab, Utah, the daughter of
Edward Burton and Ida Ann Wilkey Ockey. She
and their five children survived him, as well as
one brother and four sisters.
