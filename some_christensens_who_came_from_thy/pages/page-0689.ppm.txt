exception. In fact she was a very doting mother,
withall.

The move to Manti at Christmastime of 1924
and the taking over of the Eagle House hotel there
was a very challenging experience for Millie, but
she was equal to it in every way. She was a fine
cook, a good housekeeper, an excellent manager,
and people liked her, Besides, she seemed to be
an indefatigable worker and her health was good.
The fact that those years ahead, which then looked
so promising, should be saddened by the long illness
and untimely death of her dear husband, was a sor-
row to her indeed and left her very lonely. Two
letters written by her soon after his death, 4 Dec.
1932, one to her son Melrose, whom she called
"Rosy", and his family and one to her daughter

Sunday afternoon right after you left. It seemed so
lonesome and awful here. We spent the evening at
Leo's (her brother) and left Grace for work next
morning. When we returned the house seemed so
empty and cold we three slept together. I'm so
thankful for Dave and Max. Last night Max said
to Dave, 'We can't both go to Mutual, we've got to
take turns staying with mother.' So Dave stayed.
Before the night was over seven people came in
and I have just given them breakfast. The lamb-
buyers came back. I have a hired girl to help me
house clean and catch up with so many neglected
jobs. She is ironing. We washed yesterday and
had the pig killed. I'll send you some when I get
at it.

"IT may go to Salt Lake this weekend, There
are bills and so much to tend to and we can do our
Christmas shopping. Grace wants to go. I had to
go to the bank this morning and borrow some money
