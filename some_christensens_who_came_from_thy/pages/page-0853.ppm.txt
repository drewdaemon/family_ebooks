Wilson), We went to Los Angeles, Calif. where I

(30) Everette Hale Christensen (4) was born
12 Mar. 1907 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He was
named and blessed 2 June 1907 by Niels R. Peter-
sen; baptized 31 Aug. 1915 by Andrew Christensen
(no relation); confirmed the same day by Andrew
Thomson Jr, and ordained a Deacon 8 Nov. 1920
by Joseph H. Carpenter - all in Manti.

I remember him as a round faced, tow
headed little fellow whose hair was rather hard to
manage - a typical Christensen youngster, who
grew to look more like our father than any other
of his sons, though never quite as tall, He was
more modest than us other children and had such
a sweet, gentle disposition, He was so easy to
get along with and I always had a motherly feeling
towards him and tried to take his part in the little
family squabbles that inevitably take place among
children, even in the best of households,

_ We catch glimpses of him as a lad between
his fourth and eighth years, as mother saw him,
for she jotted these accounts down in her journal:

"Sunday morning Aug. 20, 1911 - Iwas
sitting out on the porch a few moments ago watching
Sherman and Hale. They were by the fence gather-
ing the pink hollyhocks. Hale had on his little white
suit and their white heads looked beautiful to me
