and one to whom others looked for aid. A story is
told of Christen at that time by his granddaughter,
Florence C, Hougaard:-- "One morning the family
was seated at breakfast when they heard the mooing
of a cow close by, They had no cow - so they went
outside to see. Behold it was one of their own cows
