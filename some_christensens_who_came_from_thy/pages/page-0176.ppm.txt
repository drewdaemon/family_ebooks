Kobberod 162

only briefly by the small graves and luckily saw
naught of him. They were filled with sorrow and
regret at having to leave friends and relatives, of
course, but more so at having to leave their little
ones there. Then there was their first born,
Christen, It would be hardest of all to leave him
