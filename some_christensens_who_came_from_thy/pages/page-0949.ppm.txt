scholarship, looks and personality - guess you can
tell I'm proud of our children! They are one hund-
red percenters in church attendance, all baptized
LDS of course, and active in church activities.
They hope to bring their father into the church
someday.

"During high school I was secretary in the
Sunday School, Sunday School organist, and Primary
â€˜Blue Bird' teacher. During college days 1 was
active in the LDS Institute. In our present West-
chester Ward in California I have been Relief
Society organist from 1959 to the present.

"To me life has always been intere sting, with
wonderful experiences, Working in a National Park
winter and summer was a rare opportunity for
observing nature and wild life. The C.A.A. was
another enriching experience, as control of air
traffic is intensely complex and fascinatin
met many interesting people - my employer, L.
Ponton de Arce, for instance, was one of the men
who originated our system of air traffic control as
we know it today. I also got to see a good-looking
naval officer now and then, named Sherman Chris-

tensen, a cousin from the office of Commander
Max Black.

"My work as a pianist in dance bands since
I was sixteen has given me the chance to meet and
observe countless people during their lighter mo-
ments - very revealing. I enjoy people and love
to play the piano, so this has been a painless
though demanding way of earning during the years.
My husband and I still play, more asa hobby now,
but the demand always seems to be there.

"T have too many wonderful memories of my
parents to even begin to share them at this time.
Their influence on my life was always for good - I
cultivated my own faults!"
