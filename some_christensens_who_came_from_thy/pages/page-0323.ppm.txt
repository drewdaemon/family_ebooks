dying mother? Not Else!

Sarah Madsen passed away Friday 25 May
1888, less than two months before her twenty-
eighth birthday. She was buried a few days later
in the Gunnison cemetery beside another baby
daughter, Almira, who had died at two years,
With the full consent of the bereaved husband,
Else took the two month eleven day old Ada Lorena
Madsen into her home and cared for the motherless
little girl as if she were her own. We have been
told that little Ada, though frail and sickly, was
very bright and of a very sweet nature and that the
nine Christensen children, as well as Laurs and
Else, took her to their hearts, This was especially
true of one year old Elvena, who adored Ada, and
the feeling seemed to be mutual between them,
They played by the hour together and Else even
dressed them alike when she could. People oftenâ€™
thought the two little girls were twins, although
Elvena had very blonde curls while Ada's were
very dark, Ada was not officially adopted by the
Christensens, yet she was much loved by them and
treated as their very own. No strings were attached
to her by the Madsen family. Her natural father
gave her foster parents this written statement:--
"Thereby give my consent for my daughter, Ada
Lorena Madsen, to be called by the name of the
people who raise her, - Victor A, Madsen." So
they changed the small girl's name to Ada Chris-
tensen,

For a little more than eleven years the
people of the Church, but more particularly the
Saints in Sanpete Valley, had awaited with great
anticipation the completion of the immense and
beautiful building that was being erected. Ona
hill of solid stone jutting west into the valley from
the rugged Wasatch Mountains east of the city of
Manti, the magnificent structure had grown until
now it stood in all its glory on the crest of ''Temple
Hill", its delicate towers patterned against the sky,
It appeared like a glittering jewel on the bosom of
the mountain range. Built of oolitic stone ofa
warm cream or ivory color, which had been
quarried from these same mountains, it commanded
