801 Rex Christensen

"Rex had lived in Ogden ever since he
returned from his mission in New Zealand in 1928,
except for one year in The Dalles, Oregon, where
his second wife, Ina, became ill with a brain tumor
and they returned to Ogden to be near her family,
and the six months he and I and the family lived in
Redlands, Calif. in 1950.

"He was a good husband and father. A
couple of years before his death we attended
'Project Temple' together and on June 22, 1967
he took me and our sons to the Logan Temple to
be sealed to him for all eternity. Though we miss
him so much we realize he is better off where he
is. I am now interested in getting his genealogy
together, as well as my own." Children and des-~-
