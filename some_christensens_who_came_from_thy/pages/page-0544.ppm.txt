(3) JOSEPH "'C'' CHRISTENSEN

Joséph, third son of Laurs and Else K,
Christensen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah
Tuesday 7 Mar. 1871. He was christened plain
Joseph, but in early manhood he assumed the middle
initial ''C'' which he seldom ever used, and changed
the last part of the original spelling of his surname
from ''sen!''! to ''son"', unofficially however. When
he was going on four years old he and his father,
mother and two older and one younger brother
moved a few miles southeast from Gunnison to
North Mayfield, where they joined in the '' United
Order'' experiment. When the "'Order'' dissolved
the family moved across Twelve Mile Creek to
South Mayfield and his father bought a home there.
This home is still standing and in good condition

(1968).

Joseph received his first lessons in reading,
spelling and numbers at his mother's knee, while
she was spinning, weaving, knitting or doing other
household tasks, He first attended school in South
Mayfield and excelled as a student.

Accounts of him and his brothers roaming
the hills there, swimming in Twelve Mile Creek,
riding their Indian pony, helping on their father's
farm and even raiding the Bishop's watermelon
patch, are given in earlier pages of this book.
Fishing was another thing he enjoyed in Mayfield,
and visiting nearby Indian camps to wrestle with
young Indian boys his own age, He was a strong,
well-built young fellow. There were cold winters
