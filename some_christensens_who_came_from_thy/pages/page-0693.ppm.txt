Millie had numerous friends in Salt Lake and
she continued to remain active, She was always
most thoughtful and considerate of her many rela-
tives and never missed an opportunity to be of
service to them. She was a member of the McKay
Ward, Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and the
"Silver Crest Club", a social group of ladies whom
she enjoyed very much. They had such good times
together. Though Millie's later years were saddened
by the death of her son Wesley, at 48, the grueling
service of her son Max during the second world war
as a crewman of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
which had ten announced battles to its credit,
including the raid on Tokyo, and his long illness
that resulted as well as the serious illness of her
son Melrose, yet she kept her courage and went
forward, doing all she could for her family and
friends. Her own health remained comparatively
- good and she continued to keep very busy.

She passed away rather suddenly at her home
of cardiac failure, Wed. Nov. 1, 1961 at 2 p.m.
She was seventy-nine years eight months and six
days old, She had outlived her husband Arthur
twenty-nine years lacking one month. She was
survived by three sons and two daughters, twelve
grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, five
sisters and two brothers, Funeral services were
held at the Mortuary at 36 East 7th South in Salt
Lake City at 10 a.m. Sat. 4 Nov, 1961 and burial
was later that day in the Manti City Cemetery,
where she was placed beside her beloved husband
