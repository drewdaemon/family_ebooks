wild rose of spring for her,

Father cautioned us to watch out for rattle-
snakes at Flat Canyon as we picked peaches,
fished salamanders from the water cistern, or
wandered up the canyon of odd shaped rocks nearby,
whose formation resembled giant cooking pots all
turned topsy-turvy, so aptly called ''Hell's Kitchen",
With father we took our annual birthday trips by
train or stage to Richfield, Price and other places
he held court. He drove when we took our first car
rides, I sitting in the bottom of the back seat of our
new Buick eating salty soda crackers to keep from
getting "car sick",

It was at the new home that we sat with him
and mother in the shelter of the broad front porch
and watched battles of the elements in the heavens
as 'Thor swung his great hammer ina rumble of
thunder'' or "Odin flashed through the sky in his
chariot of fireâ€™. There was nothing to fear when
father was near. Here we sat in the living room
with the firelight from the fireplace reflected in
the polished floors and colonnades, while mother
read to us and father peeled apples or cracked nuts
for our enjoyment. It was here we waited breath-
lessly at the bend of the staircase for the grate-fire
to be prodded into blazing, the wax candles to be
lighted on the Christmas tree, and for that most
thrill tingling sound of all - father's ''Well, well,
well, it looks as if Santa Claus has been here after
all!" As if there was ever any doubt of it at our
house, *

It was at the San Francisco World Exhibition
the summer of 1915 that mother, Elaine and I were
shepherded around so expertly by father through
the maze of beautiful buildings, exhibits, museums,
courts, parks and statuary, with the ''Tower of
Jewels'' looking down over all and pigeons, pigeons
everywhere, which we often fed. There were so
many things for our wondering eyes to "drink in" -
people from all over the world in their native
costumes - ex-U. S, president William Howard
Taft with silk topped hat, tails and a fancy cane
among them, With father we stood hand in hand
on the broad steps of the ''Court of the Four Winds'!
and listened in rapture to the chains of silver sound
