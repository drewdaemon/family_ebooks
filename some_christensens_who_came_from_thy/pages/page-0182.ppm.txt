Karen and the younger girls again occupied the
carriage, Going north a few more miles they

soon swung almost east around Lund Fjord. Lars
Myrup pointed out that directly north a mile or so
from there was Bulbjerg, a white chalk cliff
towering out over the Skagerrak Sea some 165 feet,

town center, Its industries (akvavit, cement,
tobacco) had more recently carried its name far
and wide. Rightly called a gay and friendly town,
its large parks, with many sculptures, relieved
the pattern of houses, and restaurants, theaters,
and the pleasure gardens (Tivoli-Karolinelund) _
provided healthy entertainment. Other places of
interest there included the St. Budolfl Church
(Botolph); the Monastery of the Holy Ghost (1432);
Aalborg Museum of History and Art; the Aalborg
