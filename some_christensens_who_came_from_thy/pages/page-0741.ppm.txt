dreamer-of-a-father was elated and thought he
could see me through. Grace was graduating that
spring while I had had only two winters and one
summer of college.

'The day of departure arrived but the money
father expected did not. However, he had arranged
for me a loan of $300. 00 through the church school
system, This would barely pay my fare, my tuition
at the Leland Powers School of Dramatic Art and
my first months rent, with a little left over. Flo-
rence Jepperson had written ahead and engaged us
room and board with a couple she knew in Boston,
When we arrived there were about three weeks left
before school started. Iimmediately found a job
as waitress in a downtown cafe, The place was
busy and the trays were heavy. I stayed on but

"I know it was through prayer that I ran
across the exclusive little French Pastry Shop
owned and managed by Mr. Constantin, a Greek

insufficient money for board I asked our landlady
for permission to fix my own meals. Breakfast
consisted of hot chocolate made with canned milk
and water, and a peanut butter or honey sandwich,
Lunch consisted of a large 5¢ apple or, if I was
extra hungry, a 1l0¢ plate of spaghettie purchased
on my way from school, My night meal, included
with my job, was soup or salad, a sandwich, cer-
tain pastries or ice cream, And thus I managed,

"TI decided to change from drama to my first
love, music the next fall and planned to enter the
New England Conservatory of Music, Funds would
not allow for a trip home that summer so I accepted
