269 United Order

my brother, It was a beautiful day in early sum-
mer when the air was balmy and laden with the
smell of pinon pine, cedar and flowers along the
way. But the joy of riding soon vanished. Immed-
iately ahead there came toward us a band of
Indians, swinging their blankets and ‘whooping it

Indian boy was thrown, (After Mayfield was
settled, Indians often came, spending a week or
two in town gathering food such as flour, pork and
eggs, They often brought dried venison to trade. }

"Later when I could ride alone I learned that
a boy makes a poor hitching post. My father and
some of the older boys were working on a 15-acre
