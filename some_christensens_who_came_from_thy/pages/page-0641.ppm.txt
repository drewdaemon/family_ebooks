Emma 600

buggy days, when we children were older, we often
took her to her meetings in the car and waited to
drive her home, She never did learn to drive the
car, I can also remember how often we had Sunday
guests and Conference visitors, My, the crowds
were always with us. Wish I knew how to handle
guests with the grace and efficiency mother did,

season of the year, She was buried 7 Sept. 1927
in the Gunnison cemetery following a well attended,
beautiful funeral service worthy of such a lovely
lady.

Ada, gentle and sympathetic in nature like
Emma, was at her mother's bedside almost con-
stantly during this serious and final illness. She
pled with her not to leave them, Ada has operated
