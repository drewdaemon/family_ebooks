as a child. He attended schools at Lyman, Evan-
ston and Cheyenne. We met at a high school dance
at Lyman, After our marriage we lived at Lyman
for several years,

"Though his main hobby seemed to be reading,
Dale always loved to work around machinery,
trucks and heavy equipment. He started following
construction work which took us to Oregon, Nevada
and Idaho. (Dale, assisted by Ruby, owned and
managed a large trucking concern in what was
known as ''The Dalles" Oregon for some time; also
a service station), His last year was spent at
Nampa, Idaho. He became an invalid here after
suffering a heart attack and stroke. Dale had
always had such perfect health prior to this."

On 22 Sep. 1947 Dale and Ruby adopted a
nine year old girl, Rosealyce (b. 3 May 1938 at
Green River, Wyoming) but the experiment turned
out to be a failure, Dale was a big, good looking
man with beautiful brown eyes, inherited from his
mother. He passed away in Nampa, Idaho, 10
Oct. 1958, three days after his fifty-first birthday.
He was buried 14 Oct, 1958 in Lyman, Wyoming.
