65 Kjallerup

ancestors had even been there on the peninsula

at the time of the Vikings and before, fighting

away to keep their lands and freedoms on this
fringe of northwestern Jutland. Anders had no
complaint with life, Hadn't Mette given hima
daughter right away and then a son of his own?

Two fine children in three years and now a third
was on its way. This thought brought him back to
the present with a start. How his mind had skipped
around and busied itself as he had jogged along, his
breath frosty on the air, forgetting the cold in the
warmth of his memories,

He hurries the horses, There is no time for
thinking his own thoughts once the chatty midwife
has bundled herself into the wagon beside him, or
back at the cottage either where Mette lies crying
out in pain. Had it not been so biting cold Anders
would have stayed outside with the livestock and
left the women to it, As it is, however, he
brings in more logs and feeds the fire since young
Christen, despite his chiding, has let it grow low
and gone off to sleep, That boy is poor to heed!
Anders replenishes the kettle and gets the water
to boiling, for use of the midwife, and then turns
his hands to odds and ends of other small tasks
while he waits patiently for a glimpse of his
second own son. But it was not a son but a
healthy baby daughter that Mette presents to
Anders on that 9th day of February 1847 in their
thatched cottage in Kjallerup, Thisted, Den-
mark, ....

The scene in Kjallerup fades and Iam back
at my writing here in Provo, Utah this February
of 1969, thankful for the warmth of my gas heated
home with its electric lights and hot and cold
running water, as well as all the other comforts
afforded me in this day and age, Rather regret-
fully my mind comes back to now for there is
work to do here, Before me on the table are
many written details pertaining to the lives of our
Danish progenitors - notes, journals, old letters,
maps - jottings from the memories of their child-
ren and grandchildren assembled and sorted long
after the events they describe are one with the
years, I pick up some of these and read them
