Tresia 674

friend next door, with whom she says she "has a
ball", Though her eyes are rather poor now and
she is forced to use a cane some, yet she gets
around among her friends and enjoys life,

For a number of years after Ray Moore's
death she made a yearly trip to Salt Lake City
each autumn by bus and stayed with her cousin
Della Newren Rudy in Salt Lake City for several
weeks. At these times she visited around in Salt
Lake and Provo with the descendants of Laurs and
Else K. Christensen, to the fourth generation, She
attended several Christensen family reunions. She
is the only person now living that ever dwelt inti-
mately with Laurs and Else and their family. She
has added so many ''memories'' to the pages of
this book,

Perhaps the happiest event in Tresia's later
years took place 12 Oct. 1965, when she went to
the Salt Lake Temple for her own endowments and
was sealed to her second husband, James Lacy, for
all eternity. She is now waiting hopefully for the
opportunity to go again to the temple and be sealed
to her own father and mother, together with her
deceased sister Edith. Their temple ordinances
are now being taken care of in preparation for this
holy work, May she be thus blessed! Someday she
will meet again with those she once knew and loved,
as we shall meet our loved ones, on the other side
of the veil.
