with a then undetermined illness, Albert divided
his limited time among them, doing whatever he
could for each, His father-in-law passed away

3 Aug. 1928 in Salt Lake City. Albert was on hand
when the end came and again at Manti when last
rites were conducted for the fine old gentleman,
Joseph S, Snow. Nov. 10, 1928 he was called
