Iwas determined to worry less and have more fun
that year and it proved to be a challenging, wonder-
ful one for me, both educationally and socially. I
was chosen to serve as High School Studentbody
vice-president. I took part in several plays under
the new college dramatic coach, Dr. T, Earl Par-
doe. Isang in choruses, vocal ensembles, and
did some soprano solo work. Ialso met a young
man for the first time, by the name of Daniel
Keeler, although we had been students together
the year before. His home was just a block from
the Hydes where I lived again that year. We began
dating.

I graduated from B.Y. High the spring of
1920, while Elaine took the college preparatory
course of three years high school only, so that
we could enter as freshmen together at the Univer-
sity the next fall, which we did. That too was a
wonderful school year for me. Iwas elected vice-
president of the freshman class. Elaine and I took
private vocal from the new voice teacher, Prof.
Florence Jepperson (later Dr. Florence J. Madsen),
Again I took part in dramas, choruses, etc., and
had a lead in the college opera. I was a member
of the ladies trio that was chosen to represent BYU
at the Utah State Fair that year. Elaine and I be-
gan singing duets together and with Prof. Jepper-
son as our coach and often our accompanist and
we were soon in Much demand for school, church
and community functions. For the third straight
year we lived at Oscar and Stella Hydes. Again
I dated Daniel Keeler, star basketball and football

player and trackman.

Second year college was also great and again
dramatic and musical activities took much of my
time and attention. I was also assistant editor of
the college literary magazine that year. Elaine
and I, together with five of our very special girl
friends, organized one of the first, if not the first,
Social clubs at BYU. At first we called ourselves
the 'Seven Sisters'' which was later changed to the
more sophisticated O, S. Trovata. Iwas active in
Mask Club and for this group presented a dramatic
reading of the three-act play ''Merely Mary Ann",
One of the most exciting experiences of that year,
