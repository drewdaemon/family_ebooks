Utah, living first in Price where he sold cars for
his brother-in-law's agency; then in Helper where
he operated a service station, and finally to the
mining camp of Latuda where he eventually went
into the coal mine there. It was by then the time
of the great depression and jobs were scarce. Our
second child, Jennie, was born in my folks! lovely

of the time, since we seldom could find anyone else
who would do it in that very small branch. During
this time the ladies' chorus which I organized and
directed won the Stake contest, the District,.and
was chosen to go to Salt Lake City to participate
