singing lullabies in her deep, rich contralto, until
she had put both herself and the little one to sleep.

Myrtle did much community service both
before and after her marriage. Her war work
during World War I and her humane efforts nursing
the sick during the great flu epidemic which both
accompanied and followed it, were worthy of note
as was her service during World War II making
parachutes and doing other war sewing. She was
a member of the ''Hopeless Club" in Manti for
years and was an active participant in the Utah
Sorosis Club of Provo for fifteen years while
living in Orem, where her literary knowledge was
used to benefit many. She worked long hard hours
helping to get the Scera Center in Orem started.
She did a lot in Four H Club work for young girls.

munities and served as president of the Orem
organization for some time.

some forty-five years or more, she taught numbers

the Young Ladies in Beaver Ward and then coun-

as Ward President of the Y.L.M.1I.A. one year
in Orem, She was president of the ward Primary
there for seven years. She served on the Stake
Board of the Relief Society while living in Orem
and was class leader in all departments of the
society on a Ward level at one time or another
