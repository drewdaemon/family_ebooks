611 Louis

Wyoming in March of 1916. He then had six living
children, the youngest and second daughter, Alice,
being less than two years old. His sister Elsie
took her five children and moved to Wyoming at
the same time. The night before they left Gunni-
son they all stayed at their sister Emma's, who
lived but a mile from the Gunnison depot, from
which they all left by train the next mo rning, 27
Mar, 1916. Both families lived intwo rooms of
the four-roomed cabin that Chris had built on his

became active in the law enforcement of the region.
He bought out the property of his deceased brother
Chris on The Oasis and his holdings there then
totaled some 882 acres and the four roomed cabin
built by Chris, which his family used from time to
time. He continued to farm on the ranch, in be-
tween his duties as deputy sheriff; it was a good
place to keep his boys busy.

Life was not easy for Louis or his family
that winter following Chris' death. Rumors about
the burning of the crops and the killing and other
outrages on the ranch were flying thick and fast.
Some pecple were friendly to the Christensens and
