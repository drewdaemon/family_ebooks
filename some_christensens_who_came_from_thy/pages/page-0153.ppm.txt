liked. At the same time it was decreed by him
that peasants could once again buy and own their
own farms and land. (This was a great step for-
ward, for they had been deprived of this freeman
privilege of owning property since the days of
King Christian II], having been forced since that
time to either rent their lands and pay manorial
dues in money, crops and labor to the nobles,
church or State, or labor entirely on the large
estates of these great landowners,) Agriculture
was given a lift in the country through the intro-
duction of improved methods of cultivation, new
farm implements and better ploughs.

Christen Christensen, the father of the family,
had good reasons to be proud in his own right,
aside from the accomplishments of his ancestors;
for he himself was no ordinary fellow. He had
been brought up in the era "after Napoleon" ina
Danish household of modest demands and thriftiness,
Likely he attended school at the parish town of Ydby
in winters, from age eight to twelve inclusive,
walking to and fro for that purpose in all sorts of
weather, In summers he must have helped on the
farm his father had been able to take over from
his father, When he was two months short of his
fifteenth birthday and the "age of fighting", so to
speak, his father, also named Christen Christensen,
had passed away nine days following his forty-third
birthday (1832) and, being the eldest child, Christen
had taken over the family farm, as well as the
support of his mother Maren and the younger
children:-- Karen, age eleven; Jens Christian,
eight and a half; Marie, age six; and Anne, just
past three years four months. Anne's twin, Maren,
had died soon after birth, January 1829, and the
boy Peder at age eleven, 1830, there having been
seven Children in the family in all.

It is doubtful if Christen himself was called
into military service, either in his teens or
twenties, the country being at peace during those
years and the king being anxious to build up Danish
farms and agriculture again. He must have grieved
with other Danish peasants when old Frederick VI
died, in 1839, and been somewhat dubious as well
