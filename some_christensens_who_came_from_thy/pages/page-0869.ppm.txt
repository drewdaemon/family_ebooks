Nephi Wesley 818
business all of his adult life,"!

Echos of the past are heard in the words of a
letter written by Wesley's sister Grace to his sister
Gladys in California, Wed. 11 Nov. 1942:- "Dear
Gladys. Doug and I spent last weekend with Wes
and Leola. Mostly we visited, talked about you,
the war - how it could be won, etc., and hunted
pheasants. We did a lot of hiking, falling over
fences and ditches, but we did get our limit.
Surely had a good time. Wes is one grand fellow -
heart as big as a house! Leola has developed a
fast heart - really quite worried about her.

"The biggest thrill was the deer we shot, We
brought home five birds, Wes, the Cutie, put three
extra birds in our car for mother, The older I get
the more I appreciate our wonderful brothers. They

are all so different and so lovable. Couldn't help
but think how you would have enjoyed the trip with
us, - Love, Grace,"
