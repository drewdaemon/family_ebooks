they should be lynched; and Opr. is of the opinion
that all of this is not idle talk and for that reason
suggests that proper care be taken in making
arrests, Opr. is also of the,opinion that if the
arrests are made, the younger 'H' will break down
under some rapid questioning. "

On Mar. 5th, after some careful arranging,
Mr. "'H'', his son, his camp tender and Opr. #209
were arrested and taken by train from Carter to
Evanston where they were lodged in the county jail.
The next day Opr. was released and went on with
his work, while the other three were kept until the
10th and then let out on bail. Mr. 'H!' said at the
time that he didn't think the authorities had anything
definite enough on him to be a serious threat, but
let them try to convict him he had plenty of money
to protect himself with. But he was careful enough
to watch his Ps and Qs for awhile, for he knew his
every move was being watched somehow,

So the Christensen case stood while the...
investigation went on into April and May. And
though the general feeling towards the 'H' gang
seemed to be getting worse all the time, new con-

work of a Mr. ''K'! adaMr, ''M' and others of
their associates who, it was whispered, had
planned to get Mr. '"'H'" in bad and in this way
force him to sell out to Mr, 'K', Thus, if they
could get Mr. 'H" and his crowd out of the country
they would then finish Christensen and his relatives
by fire and force them out also. Then the range
would be open for them all the way to Lyman, and
if Mr. ''K" bought out the ''H' home ranch it would
make a good pen ground for their cattle and in that
way there would be nothing to prevent them ranging
where they would, with pens on either end for
feeding. It sounded plausible.

A criminal lawyer came out from Salt Lake
City and took testimony after testimony under oath,
with the assistance of Operative #209. But as has
been told in a former chapter, the case never came
to trial, the investigator was dismissed and the
affair finally dropped. Perhaps none were more
