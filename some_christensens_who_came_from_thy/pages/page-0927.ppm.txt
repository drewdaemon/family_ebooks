"My first full time job ($40. 00 a month) was
with Utah-California Motor Lines in Salt Lake,
where I met my future husband, Harold Dorcheus
Krantz (b. 1 Feb. 1910 in Culdesac, Idaho (near
Ashton) to William Charles and Ellen Louise
Dorcheus Krantz). I called him 'Pat' and he was
tall, dark and handsome. At the time I lived with
Aunt Sarah Christensen, my father's Sister, and
she was like a second mother to me, During this
time Cousin Lucile and I became good pals. We
gave each other nicknames. I called her 'Sally' -

she called me 'Jerry', Hers didn't stick but I've
been Jerry ever since,

enjoyed our nine years in California and saw many
interesting places. It was like a dream seeing the
ocean for the first time; the boys loved to play on
the beach. While we were there, Edith, Heber

''To me, owning a home has always meant
security so I started working at Consolidated Steel
in Maywood to help get a down payment for one.

We bought a home in Whittier, Calif., in an orange
grove. I shall never forget the smell of orange
blossoms and night-blooming jasmine, nor the
plaintive song of the nightingale. Then came the
shock of Pearl Harbor and the blackouts, It was
especially tense on the coast. Consolidated Steel
built tank lighters, anti-aircraft guns and Liberty
ships, (We Saw one of these launched), We decided
to sell our home and move back to Utah or Idaho.
