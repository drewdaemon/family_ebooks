this was called for in various of the treatments
she had studied. She also purchased a middle-
sized brown satchel or kit, in which to carry her
professional equipment, Upon her leaving, the
gracious teacher bid her a tearful farewell, for
they had grown to be staunch friends, and gave her

excellent midwife and to bring help and happiness
to suffering humanity so that she may be an honor
to God and a blessing to his people. I myself felt
that I didn't want to give any more instruction in
this work, because of my weakness and long lasting
ailment I have had to fight, But when Sister |
Christensen stepped to my door there was an
unexplainable spirit that attended her and it was
impossible for me to refuse her. As I became
acquainted with her I realized that she was a most
worthy person, and she has proved in every way to
be superior to anyone I have ever trained in my
home in this work - this dear, unforgettable
daughter of God. And because of this, with
willingness and in all sincerity, I give her the
very best recommendation to anyone who under
any condition may need the sincere help of Sister
Christensen, She will attend them and care for
and protect them as a mother of Israel, with love
and wisdom and with sympathy and patience. This
is my full conviction. Wherefore I am satisfied to
leave her in the hands of God, and anyone who
needs her help, with my very best recommendation,
And may the Lord of Israel bless her entrance into
and exit from every home is my prayer, in Jesus'
name - Amen. Nicolene Olsen, Midwife and
Doctress,'!
