for the Red Cross in Ruth for a year’or two. But
mostly she has concentrated her time and energy
in being "just a housewife",

In late autumn of 1967 in her home in Ruth,
Nevada she was accidently shot in the face. She
says she remembers nothing about the incident
until she came to in the hospital. This has nec-
essitated a number of subsequent trips to the LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City for plastic surgery and
will perhaps mean others later, We wonder at
times why trouble such as this should happen to
so sweet a person. We do not know the answer.
Only an all-seeing Providence knows the whys and
wherefores of such things. Yet we know that
trouble and sorrow have a place in our earthly |
lives and that such experiences must somehow be
schoolings to give wisdom and strength and that
rich blessings will follow if we learn the needed
lessons - like a glorious rainbow ofttimes follows
a furious storm.
