This Land & Its People 12

Fierce and cruel Anglo and Saxon tribes from Den-
mark's Jutland and Germany moved upon her shores
(450-500 A.D.). These famising barbarians took
over the country and struck a blow that nearly
wiped out the civilization so painstakingly built up
by early monks and scholars there. This was the
beginning of the period, so marked with turbulence
and intellectual stagnation, known as the "Dark
Ages'' or the early ''Middle Ages",

Denmark was having her troubles too at the
time. The Roman emperor, Constantine, trans-
ferred his capitol from Rome to Constantinople,
thus dislocating Europe's entire trading system.
Since the real money was in Roman trade, Den- Â©
mark had traded in the south for centuries, but all
of a sudden she found that she was no longer ina
favorable position for trade, Trade lines, hereto-
fore moving from north to south, now started to
move from west to east through the Baltic Sea and
thence, via Russian rivers, to the new hub of the
Mediterranean, This led to trouble in Denmark's
waters as her islands became trading stations
enroute and plundering targets for pirates. A
competitive battle began between Denmark and
Sweden, the Swedes being particularly determined
to gain control along Russia's river courses,
Trouble also started for Denmark on her south
Jutland border as hostile Germanic tribes gained
control of some of her territory there, No longer
were Danish tribes permitted to wander at will
down through the continent of Europe by way of
Jutland's neck, as heretofore. A population sur-
plus developed in the land. Trade cut off and
migration stymied, it seemed that the Danes' only
great hope was to take to the sea - and this they
did en masse, together with other Scandinavians,
with the most unusual consequences! The next few
hundred years produced the strangest chapter in
Scandinavian history.
