in the bottom of the boat and, calling upon Diety,
also pleaded to be saved."

Wendell continues:-- ''Much of father's time
for the next six years was spent alone in the moun-
tains and deserts far from home and loved ones.
His companions were mostly sheep, wild animals
and rough men, He had many hair-raising exper-
iences of which he told us years and years later,
before the fire on long evenings. He was a mar-
