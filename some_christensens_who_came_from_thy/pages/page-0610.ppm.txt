Albert was most fortunate to get sucha
woman as a second mother for his five children -
and well he must have known it, for Myrtle brought
not only expert training and unusual skill to the
management of his household but great dedication
and unselfish love as well, The children fondly
called her "Aunt Myrtle" from the beginning and -
she accepted this with understanding and grace.
She had a wonderful influence for good on the lives
of these children over the ensuing years, as. she.
of course did over the lives of her own three
children who came to bless the home,

Phillip tells something of this influence; --
"Then came the day when I was about eight and a
half years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the family.
