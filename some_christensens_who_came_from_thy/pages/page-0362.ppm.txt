event, These were attended by a total of nearly
75,000 people. Were any of our Christensens
among them? Very likely. But it seems the
Christensen sons and daughters favored the Manti
Temple in which to be married for eternity; for,
whether by choice or convenience, eight of the nine
eventually entered its portals for this sacred ordin-
ance. Only the oldest, Christian, and his wife
Caroline had their eternal marriage performed in
the great Salt Lake Temple - but that is another
story.

This was an important year for Gunnison
also for near its close, under the power of the
Sanpete County Court at Manti, Gunnison finally
became a town (late 1893), Efforts to incorporate
had been made in 1878 and again in 1881, but these
attempts had not materialized and Gunnison had
remained a precinct for thirty-four years, The
first town council met in January 1894 and Anthony
Madsen was selected as town president. Plans
were made to build a new city hall and a school
house, ordinances were set up and other town
officials appointed, It must have been at this time
that Else K, Christensen was chosen as Gunnison
town doctor, for although no recorded statement
to this effect has yet been found among early
Gunnison records, which are at best very incom-

such when the town was first incorporated, Since
her brother-in-law, Anthony Madsen, was then
serving as town president it seems logical to
conclude that he had some influence in securing
Else's appointment at this time, And who else in
the Valley was more qualified? How long she
served or just what her duties were as such, we
have no way of knowing,

Else had discontinued her public practice as
midwife the forepart of 1893. The last entries
that appear in her medical journal in this regard
are the following:-- ''Nordfelt - datter - 13 Jan.
1893; Henry Jensen (Mayfield) son 19 Jan. 1893;
Chris M. Jensen (Mayfield) son - 22 Jan. 1893;
Chris Gravenstien - son - 24 Jan. 1893,'' In some
histories that have been compiled about Else K.
Christensen the statement has been made that she
