425 Wyoming Interlude

The flapping tent villages of these rail-
roaders were soon replaced by homesteaders
cabins, Then Wyoming's vast sagebrush and grass
covered prairies caught the eyes of stock raisers,
and "cattle barons" with their immense herds
moved in, Thousands of cattle grazed and roamed
at will over the range and cattle raising became
the territory's first major industry. At first most
of the range cattle there were owned by non-resi-

business on the ranges of Wyoming.

Failing to pin down these ''bandits of the
plains" or to secure protection from them through
the courts, some cattlemen felt forced to take the

methods of frontier justice became the style as
cattlemen made a strong effort to hold the range.
Some hired "regulators! to kill the rustlers and
frighten homesteaders fromthe territory. On one
occasion paid professional gunmen were secretly
brought into Cheyenne, Wyoming in a sealed rail-
road car to join in the fray; and though the
