Laurs and Else had her endowments taken care of

In sore distress your life has past -,You loved us
all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and

after Ada's death her natural father, forty-two year
old Victor August Madsen, joined the others of the
little group resting there on the Madsen plot in
Gunnison cemetery. He died 16 Nov. 1897 and was
survived by his second wife and a son and two daugh-

(B) Anna Theresa Carlson, daughter of Carl
Gustaf Carlson and Hulda Charlotte (or Caroline)
Karlsdotter or Karlson, was born 9 Feb. 1889 in
Fjarstad, Ostergotland, Sweden, She was chris-
tened (dobt) in the Swedish church there, 24 Feb,
1889, She was called by her second name, the.
spelling of which was eventually chortened to
Tresia,

When Tresia was going on four years old her
father took his own life. Her mother, left without
means of support, was forced to return to the
home of her aged father to live taking Tresia with
her. Soon another little girl was born to the young
widow and Tresia had a baby sister, Edith. The
old grandfather, however, made things altogether
miserable for the three of them, but especially
Tresia's young mother, complaining over every
crust of bread that went into the mouths of her
little ones,

Tresia's mother was contacted by Mormon
missionaries and soon joined the LDS Church, 5
Apr. 1894, becoming a member of the Linkoping
Branch there in Sweden. At this her father became
Ã©ven more concerned with the "extra little mouths
to feed'' and the unhappy mother knew hardly what
to do or where to turn.
