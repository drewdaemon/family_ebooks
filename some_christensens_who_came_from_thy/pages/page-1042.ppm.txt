The Kingdom of Denmark. ) â€”_

The sovereigns of,England can be traced back
considerably further than those of Denmark, but
then during the early centuries England was divided
into several kingdoms of varying sizes, Alfred the
Great was the first to stem the Danish onslaught,
and after him followed a number of

Saxon kings.
In 975 came Edward the Martyr (slain by Danish
Vikings).

Listed on the following pages, from this
Edward onwards, are the kings and queens of
England side by side with those of Denmark, This

may help English readers to get their bearings in
Danish history,
