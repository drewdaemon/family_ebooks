many Christmas Eve family home evenings, Her
beautiful Christmas song, ''One Christmas Day",
for which she composed both words and music, has
also been given by her descendants on numbers of
such occasions,

It was some time before she wrote ''Old Santa
Claus" that mother began training Elaine and me to
sing and dance and do dramatic skits together, As
Iremember, our initial public performance was in
"Bobby Shafto', a sad tale in song, which we pre-
sented in conjunction with a Stake Primary Carnival
in the Manti Tabernacle. A friend, Maud Ewing,
took the boy's part and Elaine and I were the two
sisters, Aunt Retta Neff rushed into town the day
before the performance, bringing beautiful old-
fashioned bonnets and long, full dresses for Elaine
and me to wear. We were asked to repeat 'Bobby
Shafto'' at a later date and our cousin, Reva Riddle,
took the boy's part then.

For several successive years after that
Elaine and I were featured on yearly money raising
variety shows put on by the Primary in conjunction
with the local picture shows, Each year our names
and pictures in costume appeared on bulletin boards
outside the theatre; they seemed to think our acts
were some sort of ''drawing cards.'' One year we
were a Dutch couple with appropriate costumes and
real wooden shoes, We sang ''Lena, my Lena
Smidt' and did a noisy Dutch clog, Another year
we were an Indian couple and still another we were
a couple of village ''rubes'' singing ''Mornin' Cy,
Howdy Cy, Gosh darn Cyrus but you're lookin' spry.!"!
Then we locked arms shoulder high in the latest and
most daring fashion and did a ragtime dance that
brought the house down, Mother certainly knew
how to put a song and dance together and what she
didn't know Aunt Retta could add.

ITalways remember mother looking her very
best whether at home or in public. Inever saw
her untidy, unless occasional errant curls straying
over her brow could be called such. When she went
out in public with our tall father as her escort she
liked to appear as tall as possible, Then she pinned
her curls high on top of her head and topped them
with a bob fashioned from a switch she had hired
