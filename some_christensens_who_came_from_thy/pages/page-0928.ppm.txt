879 Ella May

we own a nice home, a car, truck and-house trailer
parked on the river in Swan Valley where we spend
weekends all summer. My husband shares his
great love of the outdoors with me. We fish, hike,
pick chokecherries and huckleberries, read or just
relax and enjoy the sound of the river. In the
winters we enjoy our cozy fireside and try to
accomplish special projects. We finished a hooked
rug last year and have an afghan to crochet now.
Pat keeps the house repaired and painted. There
are many things I would like to do. I would like to
learn to play the piano well and to sew my own
clothes. I've always thought I would like nursing -
perhaps when I retire I'll do hospital work, Per-
haps someday also Pat and I can give our boys
their dearest wish and go through the temple."
