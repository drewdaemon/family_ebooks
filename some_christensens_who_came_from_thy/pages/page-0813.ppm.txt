family and relatives dearly, one and all, Some
have this great spirit of family loyalty, while with
others it is almost entirely absent.

Byron eventually found it necessary to sell
out his ranch and cattle interests, first the cattle
then the range and lastly the farm, or ranch, of
372 acres, He says one of the saddest days of his
life was the day he was forced to part with the
ranch - he says he shed enough tears over it to
irrigate the place. He has sent both his sons and
one daughter on missions and both his sons to
college, All his children are doing very well,

He and Mildred have raised a fine family.

For the last three summers Byron has
assisted in operating the Tourist Information booth
in Gunnison City Park and expects to do the same
this summer (1969). It has been a great experience
and he is well qualified - both because of his friend-
liness and interest in people, and his knowledge of
the area and its history. We copy from an article
in the Deseret News:-- "Gunnison, Sanpete County -
more than 3,000 persons learned more about tourist
attractions in south-central Utah through the tourist
information booth operated at the City park during
1967. Officials said a total of 766 vehicles stopped
for information. The booth was open for 677 hours
and operated by Emil Nielsen, Byron Peterson, and
Mrs, Ferdinand Hansen, It was sponsored by the
Gunnison Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints through the assistance of the
Gunnison Businessman's Association and Sanpete
County agencies.'' An account of Byron's experience
with visitors there would fill another ten pages,

His service at the booth has been interspersed
by numerous trips with friends by car, truck or
jeep into the outlying areas of the region, but more
particularly into the wonderlands of eastern and
southern Utah, He is a great traveling companion,
He can talk for hours about the beauties of Utah's
highways and byways, mountains, canyons, deserts
and streams, Few retain a better knowledge of
places they visit than he. It has been twenty-three
and a half years now since he stepped foot upon the
sod - he who had been more apt to run at his work
or play than walk, We have never heard him
