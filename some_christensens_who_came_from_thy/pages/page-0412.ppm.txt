385 Destiny Takes a Hand

telephone office came the second time to call
mother to the telephone - long distance, â€˜It must
be word about the funeral! she said as she went
out. Soon she returned almost beside herself
with weeping. 'Poor Chris - poor Caroline", I
remember her sobbing; ''Elora too has passed
away with scarlet fever !'"

Uncle Chris returned home just before Elora
died but there had been nothing he or anyone else
could do to save her. Joint funeral services were
planned for the two sweet little girls, and since
the family was in quarantine for this dreaded
disease, as were numerous other families in the
town, the services were held outside in front of
the Christensen residence. Pearl remembers
that her two younger sisters were dressed all in
white for their burials and that for the funeral
their caskets were lifted outside and propped up
on one end so that the beautiful corpses, thirteen
year old Elora with her long, waist-length blonde
hair hanging over her shoulders, and seven-and-
a-half year old Orilla with her golden curls, could
be more easily viewed by the mourners on the
sidewalk. Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) remembers
that the neighbor children and young people, her-
self among them, gathered and sat on the ditchbank
across the road north to watch the sad proceedings,
for these lovely girls had been friends of theirs.
All were weeping.

"There is no death
The stars go down to rise upon a brighter shore
And bright in heaven's jeweled crown
They shine forevermore.'"'

--Anon

Life is so uncertain - and best laid plans can
gO awry. Yet throughout the maze of births and
sorrowful, unexpected deaths, Laurs and Else
kept alive the hope of going back to Old Denmark,
Now the time was fast approaching when they had
hoped to join their loved ones there - and for this
they fervently prayed. But would all that had
happened put a damper on it? Would little Elsie
Eliza's death change Andrew's and Sarah's plans?
Encouraging letters came again from Else's people
