had been maintained from the early years of
Christenburg's settlement, As many as 40, 000
head of sheep on their way from the desert to the
summer range were sheared there annually by
experts, some of them from Antelope Valley. We
have been told that Else K. Christensen sheared
many sheep at this corral in those early days and
that she could outshear many of the men. When
the sheep came in for shearing in the early spring,
small hills of wool-filled sacks would pile up at
the corral. It was great sport for the children who
lived nearby, and others who came in with owners
of the herds, to clamber up and jump down or chase
each other back and forth over and around these
huge piles of filled wool-sacks, Sometimes whole
families would come induring sheep shearing time
and make a days picnic of it, This shearing corral
was kept up well into the twentieth century. The
Larsen and Christensen children enjoyed this fun
year after year in those early Christenburg days,
as some of their children and even their grand-
children did after them,

At one time in Christenburg a heart-rending
experience happened in the Christensen household.
One cool evening, perhaps in early spring or late
fall, a hot log fire was ablaze in the fireplace of
their dwelling, to warm things, Young Louis,
about four years old, had been snuggled into one
of his father's old coats and was standing near the
open fire to make doubly sure of getting warmed up.
The coat almost dragged the floor and its sleeves
hung well down over his chubby hands, In an
unguarded moment the small boy reached out his
arms towards the dancing flames and at that instant
the right sleeve of the coat caught fire and before
the pain-stricken, screaming child could be given
the necessary help by his distracted parents, the
four finge rs of his right hand were so terribly
burned, down to the very knuckles, that they could
not be saved. All of his mother's medical powers
and the spiritual strength of the entire family was
brought to bear in an effort to heal the seared flesh
of suffering little ''Lou'"", Proud flesh set in and it
was with much difficulty that Else was able to save
the hand proper, She often told of how she worked,
wept, and prayed to save that hand! Nobs grew on
