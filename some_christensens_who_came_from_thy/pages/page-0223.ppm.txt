Tragedy 206

There must have been a number to welcome
the Christensens from Jutland - newly made friends
of the ''Kenilworth" - old friends who had come
before, Can we imagine the thrill of it, as long
lost friends embraced and passed on the news and
greetings from the Old Country in their harsh
Jutlandic Danish brogue? A great spirit of
brotherhood had grown up among these Latter-day
Saints; bonds of friendship had been forged which
were to last to the end of living - and who was there
to say they would not last for aye? Time moves

planted there. None of us can imagine the work
and energy that went into the building of Salt Lake
City and its suburbs - or any other city, town or

of awe and wonder, From the very first settlers
wearily trooping onto the hot, dry desert floor,
and the thousands following and building, the cost
in effort and sacrifice is immeasurable, There
was no easy road for our pioneer progenitors, No
one with values can think on these things from high
on top a mountain, where air and reason are clear
and cool, without sensing that people with outstand-
ing faith and great courage toiled to leave us this
marvelous legacy. These noble predecessors of
ours built a mighty empire because they themselves
