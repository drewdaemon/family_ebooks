235 War Whoops

Scandinavian immigrants then living in Manti, for
they had not yet become firmly settled in Zion.
These were still waiting for the cessation of
Indian troubles, or at least for the time when they
themselves could feel safe in moving farther south
and taking up land. Skirmishes, stock thefts, and
even killings had gone on. Even as late as 26 Sept.

feared. Though this incident was considered by
some to be the finale of the Black Hawk Indian

no more to do with war and the killing of whites,
and he stuck ta it. To prove this he decided to
