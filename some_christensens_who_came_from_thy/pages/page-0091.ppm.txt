had just turned eight the 18th of March that year
and Mads had his seventh festival just ten days
before, on the 19th of March, the day after Karen's
birthday. Their old grandmother Karen, now 78,
was with them but their half-brother Christen was
not. He perhaps remained in Kjallerup working

instead. The school classes in these farming towns

between times. One teacher for each two grades
was the general rule, with a supervisor, and a
sort of school council or board made up of citizens.
Of course the Parish Priest was the general super-

at the school, questioning the pupils, especially
