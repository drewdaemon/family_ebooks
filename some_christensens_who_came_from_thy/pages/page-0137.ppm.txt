123 Bested

would only wait now until she had a letter from the
Mormon Elder in Bested, assuring her of her new

position, If that didn't arrive -- well, she just
couldn't bear to think of what then would become
ofher, ''Nej,'' she answered at his questioning,

she could never give up the new church and its
teachings, even if it meant giving up her beloved
family, which she now feared might be required
of her. She prayed for them all constantly, she
told him, that they also might be converted to the

homecoming. Here was a family of no ordinary
peasant upbringing and its members generally
knew how to behave and did it, all except Christen
that is. Else was treated with courtesy, for the
most part, and her needs were well taken care of,
But there was an underlying strain between Else
and her parents, neither of them caring nor daring
to speak more to her of what was between them,
or she to them, lest the tension explode again into
bitterness as before, Mette had ceased her weep-
