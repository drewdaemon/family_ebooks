Louis 618

good thing that we were all in there because just
then the steam boiler blew up, completely des-
troying the 'doghouse', partially blowing out the
walls of the offside of the rig-house and shooting
steam and hot water in all directions, The tin
part of the rig-house had protected us from the
steam and hot water and from most of the explo-
sion, and later we were able to crawl out of the
break in the rig-house on the lumber side. I have
never forgotten the feeling that came as a warning
to me that day and we all knew at the time that we
had been protected by a heavenly power far beyond
our understanding.!!

LaFaun writes; ''Father spent so much money
drilling unsuccessfully for oil on his 882 acre ranch
that he lost the ranch and also his pretentious home
in Lyman. He and the family were forced to move
to a modest place in another part of Lyman, which
mother tried to make more pleasant by surrounding
it with beautiful shrubs and flowers,"

Soon their eight children all married and left
home, or left home and married, as the case
happened to be, and Louis and Florence were left
to live modestly in their little home in Lyman. Of
the eight, only Weldon chose to spend his married
years in Lyman and eventually built a home for his
family next door to his parents. The others came
home quite often and were always welcomed with,
open arms, and Louis and Florence went to visit
their out-of-town children on occasions,

' Florence passed away in Ruth, Nevada, 24.
Nov. 1952, She was brought back to Lyman for
burial, Left alone, Louis lived by himself in >
Lyman, with Weldon and his wife next door to sort
of look after him when he was there, But he was
‘very lonely and restless and his eyes were giving
him trouble, due to a diabetic condition, - He was
forced to use a cane when he went places, to be
more sure of his step. He began to travel quite a
bit each month and LaFaun tells of this: ''The last
few years.of father's life he traveled almost con-
tinually, first to California to see Rose, then to
Nevada to see Alice and Marjorie, then to Salt
Lake ‘City to see me, and then on to Nampa, Idaho
to see Dale and Ruby, as long as Dale was alive.
