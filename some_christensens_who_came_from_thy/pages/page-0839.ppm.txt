(26) Ada Peterson (6) was born 13 Jan. 1906
in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Her brother Byron
remembers her as very athletic as a girl and how
she could ride horses bareback as good as most
boys. He remembers she was the catcher on the
school baseball team. She was a sister after his
own heart and a good substitute for a brother, of
which he had none. They were great pals!

Ada writes of herself:-- 'I attended grade
school, high school and Seminary in Gunnison, I
graduated from high school in 1926, having failed
to graduate with my own class of '25 due to mother's
illness. During these years I taught in Primary
and was Sunday School organist in Gunnison Ward
with Clyde C, Edmunds as chorister. I sang in the
â€˜Gunnison Ward choir under E, L. Swalberg. I sang
duets with Emily Knighton at church functions.

When Gunnison Ward was divided I served as Sunday
School Secretary in the new Hamilton Ward for some
years, I belonged to a double mixed quartet under
Charles E, Ferrie and we were in great demand for
church and civic affairs. In High School I belonged
to the Glee Club, sang in the opera and sang the
lead in a double mixed quartet in competition with
other schocils. We always had a high rating. Our
music teacher was our beloved ElRay Christiansen,
now assistant to the Twelve Apostles,

"After I graduated from High School I worked
for the Gunnison Telluride Power Co, as steno-
bookkeeper and stock clerk, It was here I met
Linden H. Johnson who was manager, We were
married 29 June 1928 in the Manti Temple, I
