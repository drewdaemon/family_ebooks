an opening for their expression, Of course, after
a fashion, we communicate them from day to day,
but in such a subtle way that only the ones directly
involved know fully what is meant. These things
we have both understood, Iam sure. The kiss of
greeting, a touch of the hand, the wordless comfort
of seeing each other, the 'Merry Christmasesâ€™,
'Happy New Years' and 'Happy Birthdays' and 'Be
My Valentines' of the whirling cycles, and the
homey visits which now renew the memory of our
day-by-day companionship and love over the years.

"But now, I find that others have been more
articulate in first applying to you the honored title
of 'Mother of the Year'. I wholeheartedly concur,
and hasten to add this expression of my congratula-
tions, admiration and love. Yet I-cannot think of
you in terms of but a single year, for you have
been to us, indeed, 'Mother of the Years',

"My mind turns back to that day almost forty
years ago, when the loss of my own mother was
still vivid and cruel and I rode with you by train
to Manti from Salt Lake City where I had been
staying with Aunt Retta during the preceding school
year, Sometime later you and Dad were married,
Ihave seen you make three different houses into
homes since then, keep up with the finer things of
life in art, music and literature, and inspire all
of us to do so, keep aware of the problems of
neighbors and the world and help to solve both,
and raise not only another woman's children but
your own also, all together as a family unit,
graciously, efficiently and lovingly, without divi-
sion and without distinction, And though we and
ours are now scattered across the country and
beyond, our thoughts are turned constantly to
home, which remains simply where you and Dad
are,

"May God bless you, not only for what you
now are to us -- The Mother of the Year -- but
for what you have been to all of us over the years
gone by.

Affe ctionately, Sherman. ''
