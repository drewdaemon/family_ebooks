Public meetings then in Denmark were pro-
tected, under the constitution--if they were
orderly, The authorities were supposed to be
notified a week in advance if any were planned.

So the Elders went to the police in Bested, telling
them they had engaged a hall for the evening of
January 25th, where they would hold a meeting
for members, investigators and any of the inter-
ested public who cared to attend, with President
Soren Jensen as the speaker, The baptismal
service would be held earlier that day, but they
did not mention that detail to the authorities. They
located a sheltered bend in a lazy river meander-
ing northwest through the edge of the city, then
turning in a big loop, picking its way southwest
again towards Orum Sound, into which it finally
emptied, The weather was cold and streams were
frozen over, but Jutlandic winters were ever like
this; one could not always choose summer to be
baptised.

Just before dusk crept down and closed the.
gates of day, the late afternoon of Wednesday
January 25th, 1865, the ice was broken through
in the place they had decided on and the baptisms
began, followed by the confirmations, There were
only a few present but Else Kathrine Andersen was
among them, It is strange how warm cold can
seem sometimes, especially when one is heated
from within by the spirit, Else, clothed all in
white, as were the others, hardly shivered at all
in the icy water as Elder Lars Hansen ''dobt'' her,
or right after that either as Elder Soren Jensen
confirmed the baptism assisted by Elder Hansen
and conferred on her the Holy Ghost. Then it was
over for her and she knew she would never be alone
again, if she kept faithful. She was a Latter-day
Saint - a Mormon - and she felt wonderful--so full
of peace and contentment! The wet ones changed
into dry clothes behind the quilts others held up,
brought for that purpose, and then bundled in |
heavy coats, boots, warm shawls for the women
