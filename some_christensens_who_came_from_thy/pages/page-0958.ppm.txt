909 Margaret Christensen

Margaret returned to work at Washington
Township Hospital as supervisor of both the medical
and orthopedic floors the latter part of '64 until '66.
At present she is employed part time as office nurse
for the urologist for whom she worked before,

She has included church service among her list of
activities over the years. Some of the positions
she has found time to hold, somehow, have been
Primary secretary, YLMIA secretary, Junior
Sunday School Coordinator, Stake Mutual class
leader, Laurel leader, etc.

Since neither nurses or doctors are immune
from sickness or surgery, both Margaret and Paul
have had their ''bouts' with these also, especially
in later years, Paul is at present recovering from
one of a series of operations that have plagued him
these last two years. Margaret, the smallest of
the A. B. Christensen children, has had her share
of operations and the like, but her power of ''come
back'' is unusual, She seems to never stay down
for long but springs right back to good health
again, which she seems to be enjoying at the
present time,

She and Paul are also beginning to enjoy the
fruits of successful parenthood, They get much
joy from the accomplishments of their four living
children who have all excelled in scholarship,
sports and other school activities and church
attainment, They welcomed their son David home
from the Franco-Belgium Mission last year and
have the satisfaction of seeing him back at his
pre-med training at BYU in Provo. They had the
pleasure of attending their daughter Marsha's
graduation in nursing at BYU this June, as well
as the thrill of greeting her first baby and their
first grandchild a few weeks before that graduation.
They have watched with happiness the successes of
their two younger boys as they win their letters in
basketball and football and climb up the ladder of
the Priesthood, round upon round, All these
things help to cancel out the discouragements that
sometimes come along the way.
