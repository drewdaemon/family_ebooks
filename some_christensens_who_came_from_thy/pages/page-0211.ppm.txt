were delayed several hours. The supposition was
that the wicked engineer, in his endeavor to make
it as unpleasant as possible for them, had over-
taxed his engine and broken it before he could use
up its passengers. Nevertheless they arrived at
St. Joseph, on the banks of the Missouri River,
early in the afternoon, safe and well; and thus
terminated their railroad travel;-which had lasted
ten days and covered a distance of about 1, 700
miles. The round-about way they took through
Canada cost $5. 00 less for each adult passenger
than any other route. On their arrival at St,

commenced their long journey. Both:on shipboard
and in the railway cars they had been confined to
narrow quarters, but here on the grassy hill near
Wyoming they could spread out and inhale the fresh
air and drink the pure Spring water as.it gushed
from the hillside. (This was the forty-ninth birth-
day of the recently bereft widower Christen
Christensen, lately of Kobberod in Jutland.) Later
some of their company were taken sick with fever,
a few very seriously. Some ofthis sickness came
upon the sufferers through disobeying the counsel
of the brethren in charge, who had advised the
