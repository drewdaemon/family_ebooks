(10) Christian LeRoy Christensen (1). was
born 9 Jan. 1901 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah.
This was ona Tuesday. Roy, as he was most
often called, was the fourth child and second son
of the family. He was of a sweet and gentle nature
like his mother Caroline, round faced, blonde and
inclined to be rather plump as a child, He was
baptized a member of the L.D. S, church three
days after his eighth birthday, 12 Jan, 1909, in
the Manti Temple, undoubtedly being taken there

Elora, older, and Orilla just younger than he.
Here he started Third Grade in the Roosevelt
grade school about a mile from their lovely home
on 27th South 9th East, which his father had pur-

From 1910 on most of the summers of his
youth were spent on the Weber Ranch in north-
eastern Utah, along with others of his family.
After his schooling was over, however, he began
alternating with his older brother Elmer at some
sheep camp owned by the Bennion Livestock Com-
pany, of which his father was part Owner and
