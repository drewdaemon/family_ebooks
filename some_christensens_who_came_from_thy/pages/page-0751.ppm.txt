went to work, I met and married my first husband
there in 1929, Ihave worked off and on for years

in cafes in McGill and Ely as a cook, but haven't

the past year or so due to arthritis. I enjoy sewing
very much and make all my granddaughters' dresses,
Iam 5 ft. 3 inches high, weigh 123 lbs. and have
brown hair and eyes.

"Roy is 5 ft. 8 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs.
He has light hair and hazel eyes. Though his edu-
cation was limited he has read and studied a lot
and is a very intelligent man, He has many friends
and apparently no enemies. He doesn't have much
time for hobbies at present but enjoys our color TV
and card parties at the Elks Lodge twice a month.
Since we have so many friends in McGill and Ely,
we hope to continue to make our home here after
his retirement and plan a few trips by plane. We
want to visit my sister in Connecticut and many of
the ghost towns in Nevada."

Roy has not adopted the three Bennett boys,
sons of his wife and her first husband, Clarence
LeRoy Bennett - Merlyn LeRoy, Ernest Eugene
and Derral Duane, who are all married. But they
are very close to him as he is to them and their
families. He and Luella Ernsten have but the one
son of their own: -
