was a charter member of Mask Club and Theta
Alpha Phi at Provo, I coached two college plays,
also one opera, and assisted with the coaching of
Sazy for the Provo Stake Relief Society, which we
repeated later in the old Salt Lake Theatre, I
played one of the leads in a Salt Lake Stake play
presented at the Ralph Cloniger Theatre, Iwas
also the lead in two MIA contest plays which won
the church finals: Tombs and In Secret Places,
where I played opposite Gordon Owen, In Cedar
City Ihave played leads in Anastasia, Women Have
Dominion, The Glass Managerie, Arsenic and Old
Lace, and [Remember Mama, which we repeated
fourteen times, I have given many play readings
and solo poetry recitals. There have been so many
opportunities for me and until the last few years
I've had great difficulty saying 'no',

"Each year, besides my assigned duties, I
try to take a group of ladies and teach them how
to read and enjoy poetry, or I teach a class in
poetry writing. I have many other delightful
hobbies besides those already mentioned - tatting,
knitting, quilting, oil painting, golfing, writing
poetry, talking, playing Five Hundred, Sluff and
Bridge, and traveling. Our family has been from
coast to coast and border to border and to Canada
and Mexico, Besides exploring the scenic wonders
of our own country, my husband and I have each
been to Europe twice and to Hawaii.

"Since Ted and I were married in the Salt.
Lake Temple in 1927 (May 25) by David O, McKay,
we have had a hill and valley life together - varied
enough to remain interesting and satisfying. As it
is in any geological time, the parks and mountains
flatten out and form peaceful valleys - so it is with
our marriage. We have four wonderful children
and fifteen remarkable grandchildren, My patri-
archal blessing says: ‘One of the objects of this
life is to be the mother of a noble race of men’,
I'm sure my one lovely daughter is included in
this. If I can be judged by the accomplishments
of my children I know I have done well. Yet I
know that I have left much good undone and have
undone much good by impulsive actions,

"As yet, I don't feel too comfortable
