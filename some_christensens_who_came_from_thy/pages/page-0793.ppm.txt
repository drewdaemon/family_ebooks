Louis Lucien 744
Lucien, and they were finally divorced,

Not long afterwards he retired from the rail-
road because of poor health. He had become very
nervous, He worked his last day in Cheyenne 7
July 1965, Cousin Byron Peterson says that
Lucien worked thirty-seven years without missing
a pay check - this is entirely possible. Itisa
long time to have one's ''nose to the grindstone".
He moved immediately to Salt Lake City and
secured his own apartment. His retirement pen-
sion plus a lifetime pass on the railroad makes it
possible for him to enjoy life with little financial
worry, since he lives modestly. He lives alone
and, besides traveling quite often to visit relatives,
he attends dances and other Senior Citizen activi-
ties. He loves social dancing and is a good dancing
partner.

But Lucien's main hobbies today are his two
tall and hdndsome sons, each pushing about six
feet three inches, Both are doing very well, Jim
in real estate in the Walnut Creek, California area
and Louis Jr. as General Manager of the large
Woolco Department Store in Phoenix, Arizona.

He spends quite a bit of time with these boys and
their families, visiting each about three times a
year.

His two sons (and their families) by his first
wife, Dora Edith Thompson (div.) both born in
Cheyenne, Uinta, Wyoming are:--
