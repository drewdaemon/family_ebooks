United Order 258

The United Order in general had been set up
as a reform movement within the Church and
inaugurated by President Brigham Young. He
preached about it at General Conference and at all
the settlements through which he traveled, The
qualification for membership was not the amount
of property possessed by the individual, but his
standing in the Church and general good conduct.
No one was admitted except those who put all they
had into the association, The question of capacity
to render valuable service to the group was not
considered; the Gospel theory and practice of ''the
strong aiding the weak'"' was recognized and carried
out, that the whole community might rise together,
In most places the initiations of the ''Order'' were
accomplished by a renewal of the covenant of bap-
tism; Brigham Young and his counselors setting
the example at Ephraim, Utah July 17, 1875, The
original "Law of Consecration'' as introduced in
Missouri by Joseph Smith the Prophet in 1831-34,
was not strictly followed in any instance,

In Sevier Stake, of which Gunnison and May-
field were than a part, the organization of the Order
came nearest to the original and proved the most
successful, First set up there right after April
conference in 1874 under the direction of Brigham
Young's oldest son, Joseph A, Young, who presided
over that Stake, it grew in popularity until eight
settlements in the Stake were involved and two-
thirds of the membership steadily working in it.
Most kinds of work was done by contract, based
on cash prices, and the surplus credits occurring
from a man's labor, over what he drew for the
sustenance of himself and family, added to his
stock in the organization. When a member wanted
a house built and hadn't quite enough stock or credit
to pay for it, the Order built it for him and when
his credits increased he paid the balance back.
Besides the general stock, the members had
"stewardships" which were separate and which
included their homes, city lots, domestic animals,
etc,, which by industry and tact they could put to
good use in procuring extras, the substantials
being furnished from the Order's source of supply.
Thus the system was considered one of the best
mutual associations in existence,
