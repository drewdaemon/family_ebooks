had a 'blue' picture of sea gulls flying.

"Denmark and sea gulls - how they do go
together! These are smaller gulls than ours,
some with black heads and dark grey wings, Every
time I looked up I saw gulls flying - and at Myrup-

stant cheery little song high above the grassy dunes
as cousin Hans Peter Myrup and I looked out towards
the sea, These are pictures I shall cherish always!"
