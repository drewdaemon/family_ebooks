Kathryn Christensen 966

to my activity in music, I had the lead in some
school plays; was president of the Junior Organ-
ized Club of Service in 9th grade; a member and
vice-president of the Tigerettes, the pep club;
society editor for the Livewire, the school paper,
and my senior year was editor; Junior Prom com-
mittee member; and chairman of the Graduation
Committee for the class of 1947.

Iwas a graduate
of Seminary.

"I must have started taking piano lessons
around 3rd grade. Mother and Dad were very
encouraging and gave me every opportunity. I
took from Clair Reid for several years, Melba
Pyne for a short time, Elmer Nelson for a con-
centrated summer, and finally from Carl Feurstner
for a short time. I believe that all of us came to
the conclusion finally that I did develop what talent
I had and that it was not impressive. Somewhere
around the 7th or 8th grade Mother and Dad
noticed that I enjoyed singing very much and sent
me to Allie Clark for vocal lessons, She was the
only teacher I ever studied with so I have no way
of knowing how fine a teacher she was, but it was
a very interesting experience, Opportunities
came often to do all that I had time to do in music.
Mr. E. B. Terry did so much for me. He had me
accompany various glee clubs and choruses and
let me sing some soprano solos in the community
presentation of 'The Messiah' for several years.
It was Mother who was instrumental in the forma-
tion of.a vocal trio with Carol Stubbs, soprano;
Marie Rohbock, alto; and myself singing 2nd
soprano. Once we got started, Mr. Terry and
especially Stanley R. Gunn, one of our seminary
teachers, saw that we had countless opportunities
to perform. Mr. Gunn was asked to speak at
sacrament meetings often and nearly always
invited our trio to go along with him to furnish the
music for the program. Often we sang at two
sacrament meetings a week. Up to the present
time I feel that this was the finest singing group
to which I have ever belonged. We were all trained
by Mrs. Clark and must have sung together for
three or more years, Isang with Geniel Larsen
and Birdene Terry for quite some time and this
trio sang with the Mendelssohn Chorus directed
