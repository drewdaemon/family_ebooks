723 Alma Owen

Tennessee--that is, as Pate says, if they can get
their bags packed and on their way before a new
baby comes along in the family; for at such times
Pate is always called to "baby sit'' - and she loves
it! The two occasionally drive out to Uinta County,
Wyoming to visit friends. A. Owen says that ''The
Oasis" is a big sheep ranch now and much of the
land around is covered with gas wells.

At present A, Owen's once light auburn hair
is beginning to gray. He used to stand at five feet
eleven inches, but says he thinks he has 'shrunk'!
a little in the last few years. His health is com-
paratively good, Though he never did much with
his ability in art, the talent seems to have been
- passed on to his children, some of whom have been
outstanding in this field, Elayne as a dancer and
Philip as a designer and decorator of some note.
