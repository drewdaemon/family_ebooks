Wyoming Interlude 426

importation of hired gunmen from other States
was against the constitution, yet it continued,
Homesteaders were killed and their property
burned, It was a bigger, bloodier war than the
outside world suspected. It reached its peak in
1901. Bitterness and prejudice prevailed and
popular sympathy was divided between cattlemen
and homesteaders, Accounts of trouble were
usually contradictory and garbled and the local
authorities threw up their hands indismay, But
law abiding citizens were indignant at the flagrant
disregard for law which allowed wholesale murder
of guilty and innocent alike, Federal authorities
were finally called in to intervene in this inter-
sectional warfare between rustlers, homesteaders
and cattlemen, Conviction and execution of a
"regulator" in 1903 ended it to all purposes, but
the rustling went on about the same.

Meantime, it had been discovered that
Wyoming ranges were ideal for sheep raising.
Sheep could graze the arid and semi-arid regions
there and the dry, cold climate helped to produce
a heavy growth of long, fine wool. So trailing
sheep through Wyoming became another profitable
industry. This began to annoy the cattlemen and,
having failed to remove the rustlers entirely from
the range, they began to concentrate on getting rid
of the ever increasing herds of sheep which trailed
through the country and fed on the public domain.
They argued that the ranges were becoming over-
stocked, but especially that cattle would not graze
where sheep had been - that sheep had an offensive
odor and that they ruined the range, Frank Benton
stated the situation in this rhyme:--

"Sheep range - cattle sure won't graze
But cowboys hate sheep anyways !"!

Various practices were adopted by the

cattlemen in different parts of the State to drive

out the sheep owners, Cowboys stampeded whole
herds of steers through flocks, Some bands were
driven over cliffs, Poison was scattered on the
salt-sage to kill the sheep, When attacks on the
sheep failed more drastic measures were taken -
herders were killed, wagons were burned and herds
were scattered, For example, in 1905 Louis A,
