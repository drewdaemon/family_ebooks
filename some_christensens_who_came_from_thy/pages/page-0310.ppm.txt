in the eastern part of town about a half mile west
of where Christen, Anne and their family were
settled, It appears that Myrup's other Gunnison
home was in the southern part of town just east
of the main street which led south to "the Field"
or South Gunnison; for here, it has been said, he
owned about a city block of land. He also owned
an extensive farm near the sugar factory in those
south fields and was building a new home in that
area, Though a number of families were already
living on their farms there, inthe early 1880s
settlers moved out into South Gunnison in great
numbers, including the families of Laurs Myrup
and Andrew and Pauline Andersen, Many new
homes were built, some of adobe, some of logs.

Soon after moving back to Gunnison, Laurs
Christensen leased a farm in Christenburg, about
three or four miles from where they then lived,
from a large landowner and stockraiser by the
name of Julius H. Christensen (no relation), Mr.

their children moved from the Myrup home in East
Gunnison to a rented house in North Christenburg,
known as Antelope Valley, to be nearer their
leased farm, The earliest homes there were
three-room ranch type dwellings with walls of
adobe. ''Wild flowers and grass, seeded by the
wind and watered by the rain, covered the thick
sod on each roof in their time and season,'' Here
to this choice farming land lying east and north
of Chalk Hill and bordering the Sanpitch River,
Laurs brought his family 1 to live for the next three
or four summers,

In the meantime he purchased an acre of .
ground in the northwest part of Gunnison on which
stood a small adobe house with two rooms, facing
south and standing back a considerable distance
from the street. In this his family lived during
