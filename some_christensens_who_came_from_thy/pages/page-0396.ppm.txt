Sun was, Some chi
the photographer,

tried to adjust his equipment, Other children ran
here and there and

my legs out straight in front of
Jennie Said, ''Sit
your cousins." I tried for a time but got tired - so
put my knees up. Mother Said, "Put your legs

down dear, it isn't nice to sit like that.'"" I put my
legs down, "Why can't Elaine and I change places?"
I complained, â€˜Why does she have to sit on a chair
with the big people?" J might have known this was

d keep her in tow, Sherman
kept Pulling off his Starched ca

putting it back on his head -

Elsie warned Sharply !
but every time the picture
