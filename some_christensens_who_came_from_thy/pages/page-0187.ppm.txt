The Aalborg Branch of the LDS Church,
established there fifteen years and some months
before, 25 Nov. 1850, was now one of the best and
most active branches of the LDS Church in all of
Scandinavia, Elder Hans Jensen (Hals) of Manti,

One of the first things the Christensens had

to take care of after getting temporarily settled
in Aalborg was the marriage of their son and
daughter, So three days after their arrival in
that city, it being Sunday 22 April 1866, a double
