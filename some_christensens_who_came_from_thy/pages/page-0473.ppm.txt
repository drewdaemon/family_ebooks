447 Time's Hourglass

"Right at first, many thanks for being so
kind to write to us; it is a great joy to us, I have
now read Marie's letter to you and see that she
has written about what we know of sister's sick-
ness and death,

"About the first part of March Viggo and
Aksel Poulsen, who live in Aarhus, were here
for a visit and Vigo said at the time that 'mother
is becoming better than father.' So it was a sur-
prise for us when we saw Stine's death announced
in the newspaper. We decided we would not send
a letter to you until we knew something about her
last days.

"April lst, Dear Sister:-- We have now had
a letter from Svend and that we are all happy and
thankful for, Sister was not real sick for more
than eight days, The Dr, was there on Wednesday
and he said that she would have to have someone
with her, That was taken care of and so she lay
and had it good, Dagmar was with her and layed
down in Svend's bed and they talked together for
one hour before Stine passed away, which we
have very much to be thankful for.

"Sister Marie was here for Easter and we
had it very good in spite of what disrupts both in
and out of our little land, I think that you cer-
tainly know the latest happenings in Copenhagen,
Yes dear sister I was better to write this time;
of course there was enough to write about, I will
with words say that all in the family have it good,
Herewith will I bid you farewell, and may God's
peace be with you all, --Karen Skarrup."'

Alas, separations come and all must travel
the way of death, Though last partings are
grievous, none can escape them, There is an
earthly end to everything, both bad and good and
sooner or later every living body must lie down
to sleep the exhausted sleep of the dead for a time.
So Ane Kirstine ''Stine'' Andersen Poulsen had
passed on at seventy-one years five months and
six days, the first one of the Andersen brothers
and sisters from Jutland to go since Christen,
Else received a copy of some verses that had
been written and sung at the silver wedding
