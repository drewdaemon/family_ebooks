took up the refrain.

But the Danish peasants then, unfortunately,
had little to sing about. They had been largely
deprived of their ancient freedoms, Most of their
''Thing' meeting privileges had been taken away
and they could no longer own land. Though they
continued to live closely side by side in small vill-
ages and cooperated in cultivating the community-
owned property as in ancient times, they were
forced to rent their individual farming land from
the nobility or the Crown. For the use of these
lands they paid "manorial dues", a good part of
which had to be worked off on the estates of the
owners, The power these aristocratic bosses and
their overseers wielded over the peasants was con-
siderable. These often had to leave their own
plantings and harvests to work endless hours taking
care of those of their masters, Little these cared
if the peasants! crops failed from forced neglect
and they were thus unable to pay the balance of
their 'dues''--they could work those off too (or
take a beating in the bargain), Many were com-
pelled to forfeit their fields and were reduced to
little more than slaves, Others made out quite
well and obtained a "'copyhold" on the farms they
rented, so that their sons could take them over
from them at their deaths (though a land owner
might transfer a son from a good farm to one that
was neglected), Then, from the time of Christian
VI (1730-1746), pleasants had been "bound to the
â€˜soil'', This meant that all men in the rural areas
were bound to remain living on the same estates
or in the same villages or districts for the entire
period in which they were liable for military ser-
vice, at which time they were forced to fight in the
King's armies. Though peasants moved very little
anyway, they felt that they were really being pushed
around !

Frederick VI (1808-1839), who governed for
his ill father as Crown Prince before he became
King, served the Danish people for a total of fifty-
five years, He set about early to improve agricul-
tural conditions and to give the peasants of his land
a new lease on life. He decreed that they could
now own their own land, consolidate their various
