so the children could attend school. Lucien
finished the grades in Lyman. He says, "I could
hardly wait for school to let out each spring so
that I could spend the summer on our ranch east
of Lyman. Iwill never forget the good times I

His father became sheriff of Uinta County,
Wyoming and the family moved to Evanston, the

whom they called Jim. But things didn't go well

About ten years later Lucien married a divorcee
with three young children, Mrs. Marie Victoria
Nelson Hickey. He did not adopt these children
but he practically raised them. He and their
mother lived together many years until these step-
Children of his were grown. But their later mar-
