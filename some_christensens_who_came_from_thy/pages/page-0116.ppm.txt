made a scapegoat of General de Meza and had him
dismissed, (Some said he was atraitor!) This
was an unpopular political move, grievously unjust
and gravely unwise; but that was not all. The fact
began to sink in that Denmark's present allies,
England, Russia, Norway and Sweden, had no
intention of coming to her aid, as the Danes had
fully expected them to do, but simply stood by and
let her go-it-alone against ambitious, war-thirsty
Austria and Prussia (who within a few decades
were to consolidate into the powerful German
Empire).

As these forces gathered against the greatly
outnumbered Danish troops, they were also better

there. But still the Danish clung to it, week after

shattered redoubts, or lay encamped on the muddy
winter fields, and let themselves be shot at.

shillings a day. The soldiers al! set up in front
to be shot at while the officers ride safe behind",
He had made light of it but she knew it must be
frightful in all that cold and shooting. Christen,
he had said, was among those missing at Dybboel
Hill. (She had wept silently at this, for she was
fond of her half brother in spite of his rough ways,
and her heart ached for Mette too ~- he was her
