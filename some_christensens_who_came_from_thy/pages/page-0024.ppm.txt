the Vikings''. Bursting upon the scene almost like
spontaneous combustion, raiders in tall-masted
"long ships" shoved off from the coasts of Denmark,
Sweden and Norway, their aim not so much war as
plunder, The concurrent scenes enacted by these
barbarians (let's face it) were backed by no con-

but on this occasion the plunderers' attack was on
a famous English convent, Episcopal residence and
well known seat of learning, Its holy inmates were

The report sped down through western Europe and
everybody was shocked and horrified - but this was
