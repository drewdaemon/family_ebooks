This Land & Its People 10

probable that we too have some stone axe swingers
on our family tree?

About 2000-1000 B.C. there must have come
another wave of immigration to Denmark whose
leaders wielded huge battle axes of pure copper,
Likely only the better class peasants could afford
to keep up with the copper axe Joneses since this
costly metal had to be imported from Italy, whose
merchant ships were even then trading along Den-

the bronze age Denmark apparently engaged in
brisk and steady trading, even as far as Egypt,
and became a rich land, Then this seeming para-
