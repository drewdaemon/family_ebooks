217 War Whoops

Hawk's warriors, as their settlement had been
subject to several Indian raids, While living in
Moroni that summer of 1866, the Fountain Green
settlers had built a fort of their own and had just
moved back to the settlement to occupy it.

It had been decided beforehand that Christen
Christensen and his younger daughters, Pauline,
Petrine and Nielsene, as well as Anne Jensen,
would stop off at Fountain Green and spend the
winter with friends there and in Moroni. The
family things therefore had been sorted and
repacked in preparation for it, since Laurs and
Else, Maren and Lars Myrup were continuing
south to Manti, It had also been pretty well

Christen, Anne and the girls moved, as well as
any other incoming emigrants of the Lowry com-
pany who had chosen to stay at Fountain Green,
Likely Christen had long since disposed of the
last of his vest lining gold pieces, for it has been
said that he spent his last change here to buy milk
for his young daughters. No matter, the settlers
there must have just moved-over-a-bit and taken
