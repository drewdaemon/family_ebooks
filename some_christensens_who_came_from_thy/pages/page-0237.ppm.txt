War Whoops 220

approached by a narrow wood stairway climbing

an outside wall of the building, In the late '60s it
became necessary to strengthen the upper floor by
adding supports underneath. A stage and dressing
rooms were added to that second story at the same
time (1867) so that the home dramatic companies
who held forth there on various occasions could put
on better productions, Dances were also held on
the top floor and this was by far the most popular
of all forms of entertainment with most of these
early settlers. Dancing parties on this rough,
knotty-pine floor to the music of ''Fiddler Hansen",
as he taught new jigs and steps, were the constant
delight of anyone in Manti old enough or bold enough
to 'trip the light fantastic", Whatever one called

It must in no way be assumed that entertain-

Here nearly everyone went to church, for that is

Manti were mostly Yankees, in whose veins flowed

heritage of worship, Scandinavian emigrants,
much humbled by persecution, sacrifice and priva-
tion, had later come in numbers and been added to
the fold. They were even more reverent in spirit,
if this were possible, having been well taught by
humble missionaries and having felt the hand of
the Almighty all the way in their travels to the
"Promised Land",

That very year of 1866, as an added protection
during the Black Hawk War, another rock wall had
been built within the Big Fort, enclosing the Taber-
nacle Block. A fence was built through the center
of this "Little Fort'', dividing the enclosure so that
one part could be used in case of Indian attack for
corralling the town's stock, If the big bass drums
sounded a warning, in from the surrounding farms
and fields the cattle and horses would be driven on
