353 And Should We Die

Raising his apparently injured right hand, wrapped
in a large white handkerchief, as if to shake the
hand of the President, Czolgass fired two bullets
into him with the concealed gun he held and, as
William McKinley fell, said with satisfaction:

"T done my duty." As soldiers and spectators
rushed to the assassin, the mortally wounded
McKinley cried out, ''Be easy with him boys,"
When questioned, the anarchist stubbornly main-
tained that he was convinced it was a good thing
for the country to have killed the president.
Czolgass was electrocuted,

All of the nine children of Laurs and Else
were of course living at the time of President
William McKinleys assassination, Eight of their
grandchildren were alive at the time of McKinley's
death - Chris and Caroline had daughters Pearl
and Elora and sons Elmer and LeRoy; Andrew and
Sarah had a son Adelbert and a daughter Edith
(later Edythe); Joseph and Roxie had a son Harold,
but had lost three little babies straight in a row
after that; while strange as it may seem, Albert
and Jennie had their first child, a daughter Virginia,
on the very day President McKinley was shot. All
of the nine Christensen sons and daughters were
eventually given away in marriage, And though
this giving may have seemed a sacrifice to Laurs
and Else at the time, it proved to be a blessing
like "bread cast upon the waters", returning to
them after many days numerous grandchildren
to honor and cherish their names.

SONS

"To press my lips upon a fair cheek, or a brown,
Of my young sons - so long Ihave stooped down,
But suddenly to my surprise

i find that I must lift my eyes to meet their eyes;
That I must stand on toe tips

And reach up to kiss their lips,

These tall young sons - straight as any pine -
Can they be mine?

Soon I must share them, soon I know

That they must go.

But Oh, Iam so glad that I had

Small sons to stoop to, tall sons to reach to
