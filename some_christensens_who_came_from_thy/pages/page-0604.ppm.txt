Claus" that mother began training Elaine and me to
Sing and dance and do dramatic skits together, AS
{ remember, our initial public performance was in
"Bobby Shafto", a sad tale in Song, which we pre-

sented in conjunction with a Stake Primary Carnival
in the Manti Tabernacle,

A friend, Maud Ewing,
took the boy's part and Elaine and I were the two
sisters. Aunt Retta Neff rushed into town the day
before the performance, bringing beautiful old-
fashioned bonnets and long, full dresses for Elaine
and me to wear, We were asked to repeat ''Bobby
Shafto" at a later

date and our cousin, Reva Riddle,
took the boy's part then,

For several Successive years after that

Elaine and I were featured on yearly money raising
variety shows put on by the Primary in conjunction
with the local picture Shows. Each year our names

and pictures in co stume appeared on bulletin boards
Outside the theatre; they seemed to think our acts
were some sort of ‘drawing cards."' One year we
were a Dutch couple with appropriate costumes and
real wooden shoes. We sang ‘Lena, my Lena
Smidt"

and did a noisy Dutch clog. Another year
we were an Indian couple and
