their mother, Even their father seemed somewhat
stunned with it all and kept repeating over and
over, ''No other Mormons shall ever set foot
inside this cottage for they have robbed me of

my daughter!'' This was as Mads put it. Of
course he himself could understand, he said, that
love never asked the religion of its victims before
attacking. But why was she so set on risking her
life, as it were, on the sea, or on the great
prairies where wild animals roamed in herds, or
in the Rocky Mountains where wild Indians, with
tomahawks and arrows, were bent on killing all
intruders there? He closed by saying that her
sisters sent their love, along with his; then added,
"the older ones themselves would be most grateful

what a kind, good and patient man he was, Though
he was younger than she herself and no taller, being
about her height, yet he was curly-haired, very
manly and so handsome, besides being full of wit
and humor, To the usual love and farewell she
sent to Marie she also added the recipe for the
Christensen family's favorite dish, as well as
other cooking suggestions, Then she invited her
younger sister to come and visit her sometime
when she and Laurs became settled in the Rocky
Mountains, To Mads she wrote many things about
the gospel, bearing her testimony to him and
challenging him to seek after truth, 'Each mind
has to choose between the search for truth and
repose'' she told him; "one can never have both,"
