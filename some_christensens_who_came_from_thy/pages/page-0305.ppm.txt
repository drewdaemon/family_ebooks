Brown Kit 286

Eve was the important family gathering time when
one and all mingled their voices in laughter and
song and, holding hands, danced around the candle
lighted Christmas tree. Then the ''Yule Missen",
"Christmas Elves", 'Santa's Brownies'', or what-

Laurs and Else Christensen were among those
there to draw prizes as well as to enjoy the excite-

In spite of the unprecedented cold weather in
the spring and early summer of 1879, when sugar
cane froze three times in June and the maize twice
