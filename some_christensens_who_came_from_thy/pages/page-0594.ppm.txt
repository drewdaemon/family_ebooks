Albert 558

State and its recognized authority on irrigation law,
and in this new setting a venerable citizen,
honored, respected and revered,'!

Sometimes when I went to father with my
problems he would listen carefully and then,
instead of giving any particular solutions, would
merely counter with the question, ''Are youa
thoroughbred or a mongrel?" Ithen knew what I
must do, though the doing be hard. He expected
much of his children but he demanded far more of
himself. He had little patience for mediocrity in
those who could do better but for the weak his
sympathy was endless.

Father was a tall man; tall in character as
well as stature. He was a man of self-restraint
and great dignity. Yet his dignity was tempered
with a kindness and humility that would stoop

wistful child. During most of his mature years
he was on the ''giving end" of life. Not half his
charities have ever been told, To me he was a
thoroughbred in every sense of the word.

It must have been another great day for
Albert 'H' Christensen when, Mar, 13, 1957,
his spirit took flight. So many must have been
waiting ''over-there' to greet him - his beloved
wife Jennie - his dear son Hale - his cherished
parents - his brothers and sisters, together with
the kind Chris ''I''cf whom he had dreamed so
vividly not long before. Surely his grandsire
Christen Christensen must have been on hand,
along with others of his worthy ancestors, Think
you some of the more ancient of these may have
been among the welcomers - those who once rowed
or stood commanding at the helm of high-masted
Viking ships with carved wooden dragonheads
pointing the way?

Kathryn writes:-- "I was married and living
inthe east when father died, three months to the
day following his eighty-fourth birthday. He has
remained in my memory as the vigorous, spirited
man that he was the last time I saw him in life. I
arrived home just in time for his funeral and to see
him, as if peacefully sleeping, as I had seen him
