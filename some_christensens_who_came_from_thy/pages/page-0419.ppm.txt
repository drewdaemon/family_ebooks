395 Dreams Come True

Nessum by Hurup.'' Christen Flarup was the name
they called Laurs' brother Christen Christensen,
but whether it was merely a nickname or whether
he had assumed this name by then we know not.

So it was here that the two brothers were reunited
after forty-four years of separation, but whether
this, their last meeting on earth, was all Laurs
had hoped for aside from the aspect of religion,

we are uncertain, As far as the Gospel was con-
cerned, however, we have been told that his
mission here was unsuccessful, for Christen
would have none of it! But strange as it may seem,
one of his two daughters later joined the L, D. S,
Church there in Denmark, according to Aunt Sarah
Christensen's understanding,

Genealogical gatherings were interspersed
among the travel entries in Eise's notebook, and
according to these they must have visited relatives
in Kjallerup, where she was born; Hvidbjerg
Western, where she was christened a Lutheran;
Bedsted (Bested) where she was baptized a Mor-
mon; Kobberod where grandfather Laurs was born;
Gettrup where his mother was born, and other
places dear to their youths, Even though Else's
"day-by-day'' account does not list these places,
her genealogical gleanings jotted down at the time
do, After two days spent with Laurs' brother
Christen, they parted from him and went on their
way as follows;-- ''Going to Laurs' cousins,
Thomas (Nielsen) Wies from Nessum the 12th of
Aug.; today the 19th Aug. evening - we are here
in Tolbol with my cousin, Sidsel Marie Hvid
(Madsen) and family; today is the 5th of Sept. -

We are at the home of Mr, Svend Kirkagade;

today is the 8th Sept. - we are now in Skive with
Laurs' cousin, Peter Kvisgaard Poulsen (wife and
one child), at 2 o'clock we will go on the water to
Hvalpsund on the way to Nibe.'' Laurs made some
notes of his own regarding this part of their journey
in a small memorandum book, in this manner:--
"From Struer 9:22, In Skive 10:32 (here lives a
son of Jens Kr. Poulsen, railroad assistant P,
Poulsen, ) From Skive with motorboat to Hvalpsund;
In Nibe 6:39 - in Nibe lives Jens Kr, Poulsen's
daughter-in-law, flower trader (florist), Signe
Poulsen, from there to Grydsted School,"
