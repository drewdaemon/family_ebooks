their families were not among this group who
organized there in September 1874, Whether
they were slow in making up their minds or had

the end of the year, their problems were apparently
resolved in favor of ''The Order" and they were
ready to join forces with that noble experiment -
but not in Gunnison, for they had decided.to move
elsewhere. Thus, after five years of pioneering
in Gunnison, Laurs and Else with their four small

As we know, the first inhabitants of Utah
were the so-called "Children of Pride", the dark
skinned people belonging to the mighty Ute Indian
or 'Eutaw" nation, from which this state received
its name, The Ute nation was divided into numbers
of powerful tribes, each headed by a chief and
assigned a designated territory or hunting ground
over which it presided, Tribes were often divided
into various Indian bands headed by sub-chieftains.
These Utes were athletic, hardy, impudent and
haughty, exhibiting in their makeup some of the
best and some of the worst traits of character
known to man. Their uncanny skill and courage
made them the best warriors in the west and
between tribes there were always conflict and
wars, It was traditional with them to love and
hate with vigor and so when the whites got in
their way they often took revenge,

When the pioneers first came to the valleys:
''Yakarah'"', anglicized to Walker, was Chief of
the main Ute tribe in the Territory and one of
many brothers, all said to be of noble birth. Two
of these brothers were Chiefs Sanpitch and Arapee‚Äù-
Chief Walker's favorite domain in general was the
Sevier River System, which included the extensive
five county region through which that river flowed;
but he traveled far and wide east and west, hunting
buffalo on the Great Plains, Stealing horses by the
hundreds from ranches and Spanish Missions in
California and New Mexico, as well as taking
scalps and prisoners and engaging in slave trade
