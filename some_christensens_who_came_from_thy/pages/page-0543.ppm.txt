her with their chatter of ski trips, school challenges,
and romance, Though her eyes were poor in later
years and a magnifying glass was used to aid her
vision, she scanned the daily papers, following the
course of astronauts, the campaigns of politicians,
and the flow of general news, From these she
formed positive opinions which she candidly dis-
cussed with those around to listen, She was a
faithful and informed voter and a regular church
goer, always prepared on the assignments to be
handled, She kept her mind young and alert,

"Throughout life, Sarah exhibited a love for
adventure and daring. As a young wife she relished
the many travels with her husband, undaunted by
the inconveniences of her small children; at
seventy-two she accepted the challenge of chaperon-
ing a granddaughter on her year of study in New
York City and while there kept their apartment,
prepared their meals, served as Manhattan Ward
Relief Society Counselor, and audited an American
literature class at Columbia University. At age
eighty she accompanied a daughter's family ona
ten day camping trip and took an active part in
camp cooking, picture taking and sight seeing. At
eighty-six, though she then walked with a cane and
her hands trembled, her eyes still sparkled as she
went places and did things people thought impossible
for her; for example: Solicitous of her health, it
was suggested that she 'skip' attendance at Provo
High's performance of 'The Merchant of Venice’,
of which a granddaughter was student director,
because this involved a hundred miles of night
travel. But she made the trip and her greeting
to the young girl was, ‘Susie, I didn't let you
down!' Such was the self discipline, active
humanity and courageous daring of the old yet
young Sarah B, Christenson, who crossed the time
bridge between pioneer era and space age with both
mind and spirit in step, "'

Her daughter Edyth and husband Dr, Burtis,
had long since provided Sarah with lovely quarters
adjacent to their own, and she remained a part of
their household until well into her eighty-ninth year.
Then Edyth was stricken with a heart attack and
was no longer able to look out for her mother.
