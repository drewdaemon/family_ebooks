and hogs, as well as a flock of chickens, in hopes
of making some sort of a ''come-back"", Joseph
engaged in a number of projects, one of which was
organizing a Swine Breeders Association to help
step up the quality and price of hogs. Indeed he
did all he could to get things going for them again -
but he was terribly discouraged.

The youngest son, Don, who was then about
five and unaware of the real situation, tells some-
thing about this period in his own history, as
follows:-- "At the time of my birth the family was
residing within the Gunnison City limits but my
recollections of the home there are vague. My
first clear recollection of home is of the farm
house down below Rocky Point, a mile or so west
of Gunnison, Of this place I have many fond
memories: - father working in the garden, helping
mother with the chickens and around the house; me
exploring the hills in the neighborhood, riding
horseback, playing in the sand dunes and helping
on the farm. I remember helping with the pigs,
Chester Whites they were, and when the creek of
water just above our homestead would start to dry
up and water was no longer running in the Sanpitch
River below, it was my job to salvage and carry
enough water from the creek to keep the hogs
relatively content. I have a vivid recollection of
those hot summer days - the buckets that seemed
always too large - and the thirsty livestock."

Marvin well remembers helping his father
feed lambs there at Rocky Point, both before and
after this ill-fated venture. He said what his
father lost was not a staggering amount when com-
pared with the money available today, but then in
those hard-to-get-money days, thousands of dollars
was a fortune when you lost it and enough to change
the course of all their lives. He himself was in his
later teens at the time and had been working hard
at the project, with his father, and looking forward
to owning a farm of his own, This failure was hard
on the young as well as the old,

Life went on at Rocky Point nevertheless and
the experience drew the family closer together.
This is not to say that there were never any little
family squabbles, however, Virgil tells a story
