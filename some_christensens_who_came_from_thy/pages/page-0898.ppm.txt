of ground and many big trees, mostly poplar which
we topped or cut down completely, so we had to

garden but I managed to still find time to fish and

“The fall found us back in Salt Lake for
school. I began to trap muskrats and skunks. I
would take the streetcar every night after school
to Draper, check my traps and skin any animals
I had caught. I could take my muskrat pelts on
the streetcar but they would not allow me to bring

market. I made a total of fifteen cents when I
worked there after school and thirty-five cents
