things plus Seminary. I didn't do well in most of
my subjects but I liked Seminary because we
studied Exodus, which involved the Children of
Israel traveling through the wilderness living off
the land and eating manna and quail. I finished
that school year and then returned.to Idaho Falls
and worked on a farm all that summer and until
after school had started the next fall.

"I then returned to Salt Lake and started
school again, This time it was a South Jr. High
School, This winter I went back to trapping and
also did real well in school. I won first place in
a writing competition and had the opportunity to
read my paper at the as sembly for the whole
school, I also was in the operetta and was the
only baritone, as I was the only boy whose voice
-had changed, I needed a car for my work with
the traps, We had an old car in the garage in
need of repairs. I got it all fixed up but I lost

mission and took possession of the car to go
courting. aan ,

"That summer I chauffeured my Dad 1 to
California. We worked with mining claims in
San Gabriel Canyon, That fall we returned to
Salt Lake City and I to the South Jr. High. . The |
following spring I came back to California, Itold
Father I wanted to stay here and work for a sport-
ing goods place. We weren't successful in finding
this type of work, but I got a job at Glendale Small
Animal Hospital that summer and continued on for
the rest of the year, The following fall I worked
for the hospital in the mornings before I went to
Herbert Hoover High School, and fora supply |
company after school, On Saturdays I worked for
the Humane Society taking the dead animals down
to the rendering plant, At this time I bought a
little apple green Chevrolet roadster with a
rumble seat, I had a tin box which fit in the
rumble seat where I carried the dead dogs, The
first trip in my new car I had an accident, with
dead dogs flying every which way. People gathered
and were feeling so sorry for my poor little dogs
that had been killed; little did they know that theâ€™
dogs had been dead for several days.
