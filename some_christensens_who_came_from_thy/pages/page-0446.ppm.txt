stay and ''have a bite" with them, This I always
hungrily hoped for but tried to appear reticent
about - but Grandma wouldn't be put off - and so
I'd stay and pull up a chair to the dining room
table in the front room where the cloth and things
were set, Then she would fetch the coffee pot or
the tea pot from the kitchen stove, as the case
might be, and while she was filling their cups she
would say in the most natural and hospitable way,
"Vil you haf a cup of tea (or coffee) Weryinya?'"'
She wouldn't wait for an answer but would quickly
place a cup and saucer for me and pour in some
hot water from the teakettle, put in plenty of cream

turned them gently over, Then she rolled them in
a bed of sugar and served them up piping hot with
one's favorite jelly or preserves, Tome, nothing
has ever tasted so ''yummy'' as Grandmother Else's
freshly made abelskivers,

She had other kitchen specialties of course,
like her Danish soup and dumplings, Her ''sweet
soup'' and ''red mush"' for the makings of which she
always seemed to have raspberries, red currents
and a plum tree on the place, were happy changes
