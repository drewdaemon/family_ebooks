and apparently they too were looking forward with
hope for their visit to Denmark: --

"Tornely, Apr. 10, 1910
"Dear Sister with Husband and Children:

"Thank you very much for your long, loving
letter and the pictures. Everything was received
in good order. Iwas so amazed at the cover and
everything - even the little string was so fun. To
think that you dear sister had tied around it all!
Yes, Ican surely see that you have lost weight,
but believe me I am far from a small thing - so
big and fat! But I can move and if I didn't have
these difficult legs I could tumble around well yet.
But they are whole even if they are tired of the big
weight and vein knots, Otherwise Iam fine and
healthy if I can just avoid cold weather, Sol
would rather move into the city to live and get rid
of the garden, My husband is striving with it at
this time, planting potatoes, carrots, chervil,
radishes, peas and onions, We are behind compared
to you but they go along too, those who are behind,
Yes, we would be so happy to see you so come as
soon as you can! Now you can visit all four of us
in one day, Svend and family live in a nice house
in Thorsted. He will also put ina garden, I
believe that sister Karen and Mikkel are thinking
of giving the farm to some of their children but it
won't likely be until next spring. Brother Mads'
wife Else has been sick again this winter with
stomach trouble and a weak lung. She is up a little
now but looks terrible. They have their Edel at
home but this May their daughter Marie is coming
home from Sjaelland where she has been for many
years, then Edel will go to High School.

"IT guess my Edel will write you. She is
home this month but is leaving again in May, She
would be glad if she could see the much-talked-of
Aunt Else, When she was younger she wanted to
go over to see you she said. Now that the family
have all seen your letter we will begin now to
answer so that you shall not miss getting word
before you leave. Edel will write, and here with
the most loving greetings to you, Christian, Anders
and everybody, am I,

Your sister, Marie Christensen'
