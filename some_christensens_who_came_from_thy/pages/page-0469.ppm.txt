441 Wyoming Interlude

greatly relieved to have this chapter of their lives
ended, The notoriety brought on by this inve stiga-
tion must have been extremely distasteful to these
modest people who were anything but publicity
seekers, But with the end of the investigation
came the end of the dream for the great estate on
The Oasis for the Christensen brothers and sisters.
The dream must have begun to dim the day their
oldest brother, Christian, died. It wasn't long
before his family sold out their interests to Louis
and left the area. Elsie and her children left
before long to rejoin their husband and father in
making a new home, Elvena and her husband went
back to Utah to live. The girls realized little if
anything from their homesteads, which were
eventually sold for taxes. Andrew failed to prove
up on his property there so lost jt in the long Tun.
Louis and his family were the only ones who con
tinued to live in Wyoming. But though he continued
to retain a good share of The Oasis, he went into
law enforcement as a profession, being elected to
the office of Uinta County Sheriff for several terms
and finally being appointed to the position of State
Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Wyoming's
Governor, Nellie Taylor Ross, first woman gover?
nor in the United States. So The Oasis dream dis~-
appeared for the Christensens, but with the swift
Changing years new dreams, new hopes, new
Opportunities and fresh challengeÂ® took its place
for all of them.
