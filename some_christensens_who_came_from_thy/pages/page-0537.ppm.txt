half way. There were lofty peaks and there were
lowly valleys - but not much in between. He was
no ordinary person and he thought big. He retained

whether we cherish or disdain, this is all part of
heritage from our beloved progenitor and father,"

Lucile writes: "It was during my senior
year in High School and about Christmas time that
father passed away. I still remember the bleakness,
the cold, the sense of loss, In his last years we
had seen him bear the weight of illness and finan-

and enthusiastic in the work in which he was so
well qualified - so nobly endowed."
