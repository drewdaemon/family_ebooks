Virginia 704

sent Elaine and me to attend B.Y. High at Provo.
He found a nice elderly couple there, the Oscar
Hydes, with whom we could room and board, and
instructed them to treat us like their own daughters.
This they faithfully tried to do and threw in plenty
of advice in the bargain. But when they started
calling us and our dates in for family Prayers at
nine o'clock in the evenings, indicating that it was
time for us to retire, it was a little hard to take.

This was the winter of the great influenza
epidemic in Utah (1917/18) and Provo was not

ment. One short fun

So many died that
winter. Day after day we sang and shivered and

were awed by the sadness of it all. Neither Elaine
nor I took the flu that year, although others of our
roommates at Hydes came down with it.

The following winter when we returned to
Provo to school, some of Elaine's many friends
said, 'We see you have brought your younger
sister with you this year, '! Indeed! Though I was
smaller of course I was older and more advanced
in school and had also been there the year before.
