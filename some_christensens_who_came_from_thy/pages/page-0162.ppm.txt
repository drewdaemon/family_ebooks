the young girl in her special abilities, Trina had
been no problem from the first; she knew they
would be friends forever. The little one, Sena,
had to be weaned somewhat from her mother's
skirts and Else fell back on the stories of her
childhood to do this, for Sena loved stories and
jingles. "'Tommeltot fell in the water; Slikke pot

but had received no word since coming to Kobberod,
although she had written right away to send her
address and tell of her circumstances. There had
been plenty of time in spite of delayed mails, She
hid her disappointment deep and went ahead with
her work, The weather was warming at last and
the Christensen men were preparing for their
planting. Mr. Christensen she greatly admired,
he was a man of strong character. Else trusted
him and felt he did so with her. The son Laurs
she had grown fond of for he was so full of wit and
humor and such good company; besides he was
becoming continually more sympathetic with the
gospel teachings, as they discussed them. In all
