375 Destiny Takes a Hand

5, DESTINY TAKES A HAND

Laurs and Else, freed from most of the
responsibilities of their big family, began to go
more often to the temple, Else had kept up a
fitful correspondence with her kinfolk in Denmark
since her return from there and Laurs had written
to them also. He liked to write letters much better
than Else and was a good penman. In spite of the
fact that they usually requested some genealogical
information when they wrote, little came back to
them. Andrew had brought back some bits of data
gleaned while he was there but it was little enough.
The urge to know more of their relatives, especially
their dead, was always with them. The death of
an aunt here - an uncle there - 4 cousin married -
a niece or nephew born - everything of the sort was
set down quickly in their joint Temple Record Book
as a source and reminder of future work to be
taken care of in the temples of the Most High.

Only those who have truly experienced the Spirit

of Elijah can appreciate what these records of

their kindred meant to them. The first part of
the year 1907 they had spent a great deal of time
in the Manti Temple finishing the ordinance work
for all of their dead whose records they had.
Temple work was the work to which they both now
wished to dedicate the remainder of their lives,
aside from the precious time they would spend
with their ever-increasing offspring.

They didn't remain living in Gunnison long
enough to enjoy good spring water tapped into
their home there, nor did they stay long enough
to have a telephone put in. According to the early
Gunnison Ward records their church memberships
were removed to Manti, Utah 15 Feb. 1909. It
seems, however, that before settling in Manti
they spent some time living in Salt Lake City and
working in the temple there, perhaps at their son
Andrew's suggestion, since he and his family were
living there then. It has been said that they lived
some west of the temple down below the viaduct at
the time. Eventually, however, they settled in
Manti in a fair sized adobe house on the corner of
