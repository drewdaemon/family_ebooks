among them, for all were filled with great hopes
for the future, fully expecting to see the land of
America and the Great Salt Lake before another
Yuletide, Nothing was spared of jollity and good
will, Friends and relatives from all around called
in for the celebration, for word had been spread
that this would be the Christensens last Yule in
Denmark, If any guests were disappointed at the
absence of pipe and bowl -- too bad -- it was the
Mormon way. There was love and friendship and
tasty food enough for everyone - and coffee too,
And there was dancing and singing and well-
wishing, Christen himself was the best of dancers,
as were the son Laurs and Elder Myrup too, If
any visitors were shocked upon seeing a Mormon
priest kick up his heels - well - too bad again!

Especially gay that holiday time was the
daughter Maren, for she had just been spoken for
by the missionary, Lars Myrup. There were con-
gratulations all around, Her parents were delighted,
they could have hoped for nothing better than that
their eldest girl should wed the beloved Elder who
had brought them all into the true church. It was
agreed that their marriage should take place at
Aalborg, prior to them all leaving for Zion in the
spring, The last thing in the world the couple
wanted was a marriage in the Parish church at
Gettrup; the priest there should be cheated of that.
Lars Myrup was nearly four years Maren's senior,
she being six weeks short of seventeen while he
was lacking three months of twenty-one, but every-
one agreed they made a handsome pair, Else also
was pleased for Maren and, when they had a moment
along together, confided in the younger girl that
once, when she herself was seventeen, she too had
dreamed of marrying a good and kind missionary.
She then told Maren about the letter Elder Myrup
had sent to Elder Hansen, nearly a year before,
in which he had told of having his eyes set on the
eldest Christensen daughter even then, At this
the wide-eyed girl flung her arms round Else and
kissed her impetuously, Then she had known it
all along, had the sly governess;-and they both
laughed merrily together, as girls sharing
secrets sometimes do,
