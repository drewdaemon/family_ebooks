How very lonely such a man must be who had no
companion or children of his own, How grateful
he was for Else and their many descendants!

Else decided to travel and visit all of their
children. Laurs was busy helping various ones
in Gunnison with their harvests, They were always
good to look after him when Else was away. The
decision made, Else K, set out and started her
visiting in Gunnison with Emma, Charles and their
three youngsters, Then she spent a little time
there with Arthur and Millie, who now had five,
the youngest, Max, soon three years old, Joseph
and Roxie always welcomed Grandma at their place.
They still had their four youngest boys at home,
Harold and Ruth Ellen were married but both lived
in Gunnison, Else was able to get a look at four of
her great-grandsons while there, for Harold and
his wife Herma had three little boys, the youngest,
Clair, not more than ten days old, and Ruth Ellen
and her husband, Frank Hansen, had little Duane,
fourteen and a half months old.

Then Else went to Goshen where Elsie and
Elvena and their families lived. Elsie and Alma
now had six living children, three sons and three
daughters, LaPreal, now two and a half years old,
having been their first child in almost nine years,
Elvena was expecting her fourth baby and her
mother Else must have been real anxious to get
to Goshen in time for it so that she could be on
hand to help with the three little girls, Vera, Alta
and Tresia, until Vena could be up and around
again,

Else likely went from there to Salt Lake City
in time to attend some of the sessions of the
General October Conference, Heber J. Grant was
President of the Church then, She and Laurs had
lived under the administrations of Brigham Young,
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow,
Joseph F, Smith, and now Heber J. Grant, and
known and loved them all. This trip she spent
most of her time with her children and their
families however, Andrew and Sarah now had the
six children living, three boys and three girls,
