not even the great Grundtvig. She had been a most.
ardent investigator before, but now she had come
to believe in the Restored Church with all her being.
The Elders had told her she was fully ready to be
baptised and had urged her to do so, yet she hesi-
tated; there was something of which she must be
assured first. Was it not possible, if she waited
awhile, that she and her loved ones might be all
"dobt'' in together? The Elders' advice to her had
been, -- 'Ja, but don't wait too long; the devil
himself has many tricks for the wavering!" But
they encouraged her to continue to be faithful and

about her lover after all. Her letters home were
many and full of affection, as well as of all the
carefully worded new religious ideas she dared

far from satisfying; mayhaps they thought her just
a ranting child. Rudolph wrote only of love and
his impatience for their marriage, and of course
about the cottage he was building. Her family too
avoided any religious discussions, but wrote of
home things and the local gossip, although they
were as friendly as always and usually ended
everyletter with, ''A thousand loving greetings
from us all!'' Else felt she was getting no place
with them about the things nearest her heart -- no
place at all.

Yuletide came in such a hurry that year --
