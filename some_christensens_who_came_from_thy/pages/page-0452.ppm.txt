Wyoming Interlude 428

came there for supplies, They wintered two
similar herds down at Manila where it was a little
warmer and they could feed some hay. They also
sent one large dry herd onto the West Desert in
Skull Valley. In the spring the herds from Carter
and Manila trailed to the lambing grounds at places
about thirty miles southwest of Carter, called
Spring Valley and at Piedmont, Wyoming. From
the lambing grounds the sheep trailed on to the
large shearing corral which Chris and John Cannon
had built at Altmont, Wyoming. Here thousands of
sheep were sheared each spring for several years,
At Piedmont they also had a large dipping vat
where they dipped the sheep to kill the ticks the
years the sheep ticks were so bad (1915-16 and
1917-18). From the shearing corrals the sheep
trailed on to their summer range on The Weber,
This trailing was hard on sheep and men, sheep

at those times with the buckboard and ''Fannie'' the
mule, and 'Old Bay''his faithful horse, Later he

Chris' brother Arthur managed the Upton ranch for
the company and his brother Louis helped with the
herds, George Clark, mentioned as having mar-

herders, Chris' two older sons, Elmer and LeRoy,
helped with the sheep or on the ranches as soon as
they were old enough,

Chris often bought hay for his company in
and near Lyman, Wyoming, which was a number
of miles east of Carter, and he became well
acquainted in the area and bought some property
for the company from a Mr. C. N. Larsen about
12 miles east of Lyman, 160 acres together with
