himself a new pair of shoes. Not until then did he

LaMar continues his story:- 'I learned the
value of money early - and the hard way. I learned
to work for the things I wanted. As soon as I could
I got a job working at Ironton, just south of Provo,
and when I was eighteen, in Nov. 1946, I started
working for Geneva Steel of Provo in the open
hearth department. Jam still working there after
more than twenty years, but I have had a number
of advancements and am now a crane operator,

"TI met my wife, Georgina, when I was attend-
ing school in Payson. Iwas sixteen. Two school
friends took me to her home in Nephi and introduced
us, Iwas impressed and she must have been also,
for we began going together right away. She was
my first real 'girl friend'. We went together much
of the time for two and a half years and then were
married, 1 June 1948, during a wedding party in
our honor at her home ward church in Nephi. The
marriage ceremony was performed about 10:00 p.m.

: 'We honeymooned in the canyons of southern
Utah,. then moved to a home at 355 East 4th North
in Provo, where we rented an apartment. Later

- we bought a trailer house in Orem and lived there
for about a year. It was while living in this trailer
house the spring of 1949 that our first child, Nancy,
was born in the. Payson hospital. Next we sold our
trailer and rented a home at 455 North 2nd West in
Provo where we lived for three years, It was while
living here that our second daughter, Marla, was
born in the Provo hospital.

"Then we bought a home in American Fork at
950 West Main Street where we lived for about eight
years, It was in the American Fork hospital that
our last three children were born, another daughter
and two sons, In the meantime we began buying a
lot at 396 West 3rd North in American Fork and
on this we had a nice three bedroom brick home
built and moved into this, where we are very com-
fortable and happy.
