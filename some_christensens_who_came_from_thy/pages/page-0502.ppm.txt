Christian A474

He usually traveled in his buckboard. He would
put hot rocks in the bottom of it to keep his feet
warm and usually he had heavy wool-filled quilts
around him to keep out the cold. Many times he
would drive all night to keep a promised appoint-
ment. Sometimes he would have to camp by a fire
or under a cedar tree until it was light enough to
find his way. There was little travel on the desert
in winter and the going was slow, A trip that would
take eight to ten days at that time in a wagon or
buckboard can now be made in four or five hours
in a car and forty-five minutes by plane,

"Christian and Lafe Bown had dependable
men that would help them with the sheep, which
left them free for their other interests when
necessary, Christian's two younger brothers,
Louis and Arthur, worked for him alot. Besides
his sheep and cattle he had a farm on the west side
of Gunnison at a place called Clarion. There was
always a job to be done there and elsewhere, with
harvesting of crops, threshing getting flour,
potatoes and meat in for the winter, and also wood.
Besides his own wood supply he hauled extra for
needy families and widows, He paid his tithing
with such farm products as grain, hay, wheat,
flour or cattle,

"The winters with him away seemed long but
the summers were wonderful. Father and our
family, Lafe Bown and his family, and other friends
and relatives spent many happy summers up Twelve
Mile Canyon together. We went riding, hiking,
picking wild flowers and berries. We made swings
for grown ups and for children and we made large
bonfires to gather 'round in evenings for fun, with
singing and dancing. A favorite hike was up
Musinia Peak by foot or horseback. Good old sour
dough bread and plenty of mutton chops cooked over
the open fire or on a camp stove was the food we
liked best." : en

The sheep business paid off for Chris in
those days and he was able to save quite a bit of
money. Among other things, he was most generous
in helping his brothers and sisters get the schooling
which he himself had been denied, He was indeed
an older brother to be honored and looked up to in
