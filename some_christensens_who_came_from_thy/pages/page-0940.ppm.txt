Temple. War preparations were very much in
evidence at the time of their marriage and David,
as well as Myrtle,, were soon engaged in the
same, as evidenced by a letter he wrote to his
sister Gladys in San Francisco about a year after
A copy of the letter follows:

"Cheyenne, Wyoming

they were wed.

"Dear Gladys:
Yes, we are more busy now than ever. it

seems like the ships (planes) keep coming in faster
all the time and fewer men to do the work - more
females, It's ten or eleven hours every day so
we do manage to keep out of mischief at home.

We have been lucky to have the same hours the
past two months; hope we can have the same luck,

"Myrtle and I are planning to fly home for
Christmas and surprise Mother; that is if we can
both get a couple of days off together. We can
get half fare and that's cheaper than bus - so why
not? It would be swell if you could come too.
Myrtle hasn't even been inside my kind of airplane
yet so I think it will be a swell treat for her.
There isn't much news to tell you from here 80 I
