read to us on summer afternoons, During many
dusk-drawn evenings our family took supper to the
fields, ran races through the clover, waded bare-
foot in the streams and gathered pretty pebbles
from the riverbed; or while listening to the sighing
winds and twittering birds in the cottonwood trees,
watch the day slowly die in the west,

"During other evenings the children of the
neighborhood met under the street light on the
corner to play Kick-the-Can or Run-Sheep-Run.,
There were other fun things I remember, like
dressing up cats and playing house with them;
playing postoffice using loose rocks in Horning's
old rock wall to put our letters under; making
honey and taffy candy; taking trips to Temple Hill
and Devils Ribs; having corn roasts at the Green
canal; swimming in the muddy, carpy Sanpitch
River; watching the 'pig-man' kill pigs through a
knothole in Alder's back fence; waiting for Mr.
Harmon's train-hack so we could jump on back and
take a ride, and playing show in Felt's barn. I
don't remember the name of those shows but I do
remember some of the lines - 'Zeek, Zeek, long-
legged Zeek. Your head is all right but you've got
such big feet'.

"T] remember special celebrations - the
Fourth of July. On the eve of the Third we laid out
our embroidered dresses, ribbon sashes, new
shoes, stockings and petticoats - all ready for the
morning salute of the guns to be up and about the
fun of the day. The band, transported on a hay-
rack, serenaded the town dignitaries and always
included our place, Then came the parade which
ended in front of the Tabernacle where the patriotic
meeting followed. The place was draped with
bunting and everybody crowded into hear, year
after year, the singing of 'The Flag Without a
Stain' and the dramatic reading of 'Ring, Grandpa,
Ring; O Ring for Liberty !' My heart swelled with
a great love for my country - would that I could
recapture more often the depths of that feeling
now! The fear of lighted firecrackers being
thrown under our feet has almost been forgotten
in the remembrance of the joy of those celebrations.
