Elsie 584

home Elsie lived in the rest of her days in Payson. )
We had not gotten settled when Mrs. Bona, Relief
Society President in our new Payson Ward, called
at our home and asked me to be the Literary class
teacher for that organization. I held that position
for two years and then was asked to be the Theology
class leader, which position I accepted and filled
for eight or ten years. My health then became

poor (she suffered from a heart ailment), and I

was released from all responsibility at that time.
When I became stronger I taught the Literary
lessons for another year. On 4 June 1952 I was

set apart as a visiting teacher in the Relief Society
by Brother Harold Rasmusson of Payson.

"TI joined the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers
(D. U.P.) in 1934, Payson Camp 1. Iwas elected
chorister of this organization 19 May 1940, Regis-
trar 19 May 1945 and chosen Parliamentarian in
1948. Iwas sent as a delegate to the County con-
vention and was elected second vice captain and
class leader, which position I held until March
1956. Ihave also been a Sunday School teacher
in the Old Testament department during these
Payson years."

Elsie's husband, Alma, was set apart as
Bishop of their Payson Fourth Ward 13 Jan. 1952,
and served a full two years before being forced to
be released because of poor health. Though he was
three and a half years younger than Elsie, yet he
was more frail and had suffered from ulcers for
many years, He passed away in a Payson hospital
following surgery, 6 Mar. 1954. After his death
Elsie continued to live on in their comfortable
home in Payson. Her unmarried son, Edgar, was
there with her when he could be and helped support
her in all ways - in fact he was wonderful to her!
Her oldest son, A. Owen, and family lived right
next door and kept an eye on her also, until it
became necessary for her to have someone with
her much of the time. Finally she went to live with
Edith, her oldest daughter, in her home in Provo,
Edith, a Ph D in the department of advanced educa-
tion at Brigham Young University, was of necessity
away from home a great deal but she had a girl with
her mother when she herself could not be there.
