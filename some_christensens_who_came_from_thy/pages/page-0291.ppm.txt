United Order 270

the earth and air, I got sleepy. I decided to take
a nap on the warm land. I tied the rope that held
the pony around my waist to make sure he would
stay with me. However, my peaceful slumbers
were abruptly ended as I found myself sailing over
the ploughed ground at the end of the rope, with the
pony running hard and as frightened as I, The
chase ended without serious consequences. Ido
not remember what, if anything, my father said
to me about the matter, Knowing his life-habit

of never volunteering needless advice, I am sure
he said little or nothing. He probably knew that
the experience had made sufficient impression.

"One fine day in late summer or early
autumn, the four of us brothers, Chris, Andrew,
Joseph and I, who often roamed the foothills and
fields together, were roaming the fields and acci-
dentally ran across a watermelon patch. The sun
was warm and the field was dry as far as water
was concerned, The temptation was strong to
Satisfy our thirst with a fine watermelon, which
we did. We were sitting there so engaged when
Jim Whitlock rode by and saw us eating the water-
melon, He evidently knew whose patch it was as
he promptly notified our mother that we were
raiding the Bishop's watermelon patch. When we
came home in the afternoon we were confronted
with the charge of stealing the Bishop's water-
melons (Bishop Ole C. Olsen). Our mother was
a firm believer in not letting wrongs remain long
unsettled, so as might have been expected under
the circumstances, she told us we must go down
to the Bishop's place, about two blocks away, and
â€˜make it right with him.' A vigorous demurrer
was interposed against this, but we were very
firmly told not to expect anything to eat until we
had made it right with the Bishop, None of us
was hungry, and at the time it seemed to matter
very little whether we got any dinner or not. (We
were still full of watermelon!) But we soon learned
that melon fullness does not last long. We went
about our play, but when the sun was beginning to
reach the west hills we thought about our supper,
Knowing that mother meant what she said, we
called a council of war. It was unanimously
decided to go and see the Bishop.
