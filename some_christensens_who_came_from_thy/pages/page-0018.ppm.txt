7 This Land & Its People

or if one were to find himself standing in the ancient
city of Nyborg beside Denmark's last surviving
Royal Medieval Castle, where her ''Magna Charta'"'
(Royal Charter) was drawn up and proclaimed in
1282--might not one, with surge of deep emotion,

be led to exclaim in wonderment: ''Were my
kinsmen here?"

2. WHENCE CAME THIS LAND AND ITS PEOPLE ?

Many thousands of years ago there was no
land where Denmark now lies, only sea. But then
time was one with eternity and there was no man to
count the years. Denmark's biography is shrouded
in myth, as is that of other lands. It was once
supposed by early scientists that, out of the vast
sea which covered all, land and mountains sprang
up like veritable 'jacks-in-the-boxes', Modern
scientists tell us that the birth of the land was
much more gradual; in fact that it took eons of
time, Future geologists may come up with other
theories, since they are still "digging" for the
truth. However, as of now, we are led to believe
that at the bottom of the sea, where Denmark's
land later emerged, the shells of myriads of sea
creatures piled up during the course of time, their
small white skeletons sinking like a continuously
moving veil and causing layers of resulting chalk-
slime on the sea bed to grow and become hundreds
of feet thick, Thus a massive layer of chalk-like
substance became the foundation of the new land
that rose up beneath the present areas of Denmark
and her closest land neighbors. Indications of this
can be seen today in the ''White Cliffs of Dover" in
England, the "Chalk Downs" in France, on the
Island of Riigen, and in several places in Denmark,
particularly the ''White Cliffs'' on the Isle of Md√©en
in the Baltic Sea,

As the great land masses arose the sea
retreated, Then time brought the 'Ice Age" and
great glaciers moved over the northland and locked
it in their frigid clutches. No man can tell how
often the ice melted and receded, only to return
and grip the land again, dragging icy fingers over
its surface, clawing out islets, rivers, lakes and
