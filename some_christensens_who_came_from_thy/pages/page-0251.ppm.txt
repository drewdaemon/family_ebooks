War Whoops 234

Penrose's hymn 'O Ye Mountains High" was fea-
tured at this Conference,

If April Conference the following year, 1869,
was considered by Laurs and Else, the idea came
to nothing since Else was expecting again and too
near the time to take a chance on so long a journey.
On June 6 that year she gave birth to another fine
son, He too was born in their log cabin home in
the Big Fort at Manti; for though some people were
now moving out of the fort and building homes on
their own adjoining farms, yet a number of the

Denver and Rio Grande, etc., were built to other
parts ofthe Territory. Numbers of the settlers
were given employment on these projects as time
went on, helping them to supplement their incomes
and giving them other means with which to barter
and trade, besides their livestock and farm pro-

brought prosperity along with it, and 'business
began to boom",

Yet things were anything but ''booming" for
