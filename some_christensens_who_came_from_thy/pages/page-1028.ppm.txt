Grandfather Christensen's sister Maren Christen-
sen Myrup's granddaughter who has loved Denmark
as I do, went to Jutland to visit the homeland of our
people. She wrote to share her experiences there
with me and I want to share them with you, the
descendants of Laurs and Else K., ina hope that
they may stimulate some of us to visit there
someday also.

Following are excerpts from Lois' stimulat-
ing letter:- ‘'Virginia, I went to Denmark at last,
on a chartered World Airlines plane, leaving June
10th and returning July 12th (1969). I met my
Myrup cousins there and found them to be’very
friendly, lovable people. I hada wonderful visit
with all of them. Hans Peter Myrup took me to
Myrupgard, once the home of my grandfather Lars
Myrup. We hiked over the dunes to see the North
Sea, while he told me as much as he knew of our
common ancestors. We visited others of our
Myrup relatives and then he took me to Thisted
to the Missions Hotel where I stayed for six days
on my own. I wanted to get as much Thisted
atmosphere as I could and I felt 1 could do this
best when I was alone. I fell in love with Thisted !

‘When we crossed the Limfjord 'goose
pimples' came out on me. This was Christensen
and Myrup country! The water even looked
familiar, like I'd seen it before! At Aalborg it
looked like a wide river but at Thisted it seemed
like my own special sea! Denmark wasn't always
as fertile and productive as it 18 now, but I'd like
to think that it was much the same when our loved
ones lived there. Pictures of Thisted (in the
Museum) in the year 1849 show it as a very small
village. Most of the houses were small compared
to the beautiful red-tiled farm houses that now
stand out so picturesquely against the green fields
and the many nearby man-made forests. The
Viking arrow heads, spear heads, stone axes in
the Thisted Museum were not the remains of
unknown Indians! These things were made by our
own ancestors! These burial mounds undisturbed
in green fields! Ancestors 1! We came from Viking
country, Virginia! I saw the evidence all around
in Thisted Amt (Thy), more than in any other part
