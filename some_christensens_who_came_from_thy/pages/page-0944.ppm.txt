first year across Oakland Bay Bridge to San Fran-
cisco, At the end of the first year there I was able
to transfer to Boalt Hall at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, where I received my LLB
degree on 17 June 1948,

"During this last school period we had put
the boys in nursery school and Freda went to work
for the Radiation Laboratory onthe Berkeley cam-
pus. Her earnings, together with the benefits
received under the GI Bill, enabled us to get by
quite well. But there was still the bar examination,
This I took early next fall and was successful in
passing. Incidently, I also took and passed the
Utah Bar examination that year but decided not to
return to Utah.

"Upon passing the Bar we learned of an open-

here in Porterville, Robert, Richard and James
Allen, two have expressed a desire to join me in
the practice of law. However, they are still young

Our one and only girl, Glena, is a very sharp little
student and has pleased her Dad by stating that she
would join me at the office. 1 replied that she
might make a good secretary - but she too is. still
young. Over the years we have built a good prac-

join me, though I do not intend to do much 'arm
