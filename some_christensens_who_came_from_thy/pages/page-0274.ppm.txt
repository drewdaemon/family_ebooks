Mt, Carharine and the Pahvants, and to the north
the Sanpitch mountains, visible as far as Thistle
Valley, Beneath their feet the fertile brush
covered soil was dotted with spring flowers,

White, yellow-flecked sego lilies, red Indian paint-
brush, blue flax, pink sweet williams, lavender
Sweetpeas, pastel sugarbalils, and vicid blossoms
of the prickly pear and many unnamed blooms of
golden hue vied for attention. This indeed looked
like the 'land of promise" to these young men in
their prime and they picked out their homestead

- sites on the north side of the creek, for the land
had just been opened up for homesteading by the
national government, When they returned enthused
to Gunnison and talked about the land, others were

managed to steal their horses when they were
turned out to graze unguarded on the hills, Soon
they knew enough to tie them up to their wagons at

watch their horses, When they returned next day
they found Niels dead, shot by Indians as he sat by
the wagon eating his supper, and their horses gone,
This shooting occurred 14 June.

In the early spring of 1873 the three men,
Hansen, Sorenson and Olsen, brought their wives
and small children to Arapeen to live. They were
soon joined by other families, The ditch was
