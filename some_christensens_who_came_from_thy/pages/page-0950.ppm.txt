attending high school I taught in the Primary in
Santaquin.

"After graduation I picked berries in Provo
one summer and then went to stay with cousin
Elaine in Salt Lake City for about three months
before she moved to Cedar City, since Ted was
already down there working. She lived on 4th Ave.
just around the corner and just below the steps
from Memory Grove. Then I went back to Santa-
quin and worked for Frank Andreason for about
ten months. He lived just across the street north
from the east end of our lot. His wife Lauree had
milk-leg and was pregnant and they had four. boys,
Ienjoyed working for them, One day Mother came

a reception the next night at the Union Hall, mostly
dancing. The day after that we went to Ephraim
to live and here we spent about fourteen years. At
first Ivan worked for Glen Nielson raising, turkeys

Castle Gate and Scenic (a railroad section just .,
below Soldiers Summit) every winter and had to
board himself that he gave up railroading.

Ephraim and then bought our own home there, We
spent one summer living in Scenic, I went to
church in Ephraim occasionally but wasn't too
active when the children were young. We moved
to Wendover, Utah some sixteen years ago. Since
coming here Ivan has worked for the potash plant
just east of town, called Bonneville Ltd. - but now
owned by Kaiser Chemicals of Oakland, California.
