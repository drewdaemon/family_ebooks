811 Everett Hale

They found that part of his large intestine
had become enmeshed with a large, hard growth
almost completely closing it off. Much inflama-
tion had occurred which had affected some of the
small intestines. He suffered most severe pain.
The doctors had to leave part of the large intestine
on the outside so that the affected part could sluff
off, and also leave his side open so that it could
drain, Later the large intestine was opened so
that it could drain through the side of the abdomen.
