831 Farrald DeLong

family loyalty which extends far beyond his own
immediate family. His two sisters, Pearl and
Ivy, live in Salt Lake and he visits them often.

He also visits his brothers, Elmer and Roy, who
are out of State on occasions and keeps in touch

by phoning them once a month, failing to have suc-
cess with answers to his letters. Farrald is per-
haps the most regular attender of all the members
of the Christensen family at funerals of Aunts,
Uncles, cousins and other relatives on all sides.
He and Beulah can almost always be found among
the mourners in attendance. Though Cousin Byron
may run him a close second in this, Farrald is
mo st faithful in paying his respects to our dead
and their bereaved families.

Farrald is a tall man and resembles his
father more and more to an almost startling degree
as the years go by. Though he knew his father for
so short a time yet many of his mannerisms are
like his, although he is much more quiet in nature,
Beulah makes him a fine companion and together
they are forging ahead towards the goals they have
so wisely set for themselves.
