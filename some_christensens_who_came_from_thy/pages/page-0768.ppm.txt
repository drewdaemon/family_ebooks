719 Florence LaFaun

Hawaii. Toured Germany - now in Zurich,
Switzerland - then on to Austria, Venice, Rome,
Florence, Pisa - then Paris. I hope I can geta
plane out of Paris to join my British Mission Tour
in London for my return home. Will be gone a
month on my honeymoon - alone! Then together
we'll go to California and then Mexico, It will be
quite a summer for me. Love, LaFaun,'' While
in London and Switzerland she entered the LDS
temples there - it was a wonderful experience,
She and Willis were all ready to go to Mexico City
when her brother Rex passed away, They post-
poned their trip for a few days until after the
funeral, They were in Mexico during the Olympics
there,

We received another card from LaFaun not
long ago - this one dated 15 Feb. 1969 in Hamilton,
New Zealand. She wrote, ''Darlings: Had a won-
derful night again at the Polynesian Center in
Hawaii. Landed on the Fiji Islands and saw very
green lawns and beautiful flowers. Toured Auck-
land, New Zealand and now will be here for a
couple of days. Today we go to the New Zealand
temple and this will mean that I have gone to all
our temples in the world, I have planned this for
many years. Again, my husband wouldn't come.
He wants to go to Mexico again alone, so I decided
to complete my plans. Love, LaFaun C. Jacobson,'!

So for LaFaun a dream has come true - many
dreams in fact,
