17 Vikings

material on the Vikings has been gleaned - writes:
"When we reflect upon the brutal vices of these
saltwater bandits, pirates as shameful as any
whom the sea has borne, or recoil from their
villainous destruction and cruel deeds, we must
also remember the discipline, the fortitude, the
comradeship and martial virtues which made them,
at this period, beyond all challenge, the most for-
midable and daring race in the world. . , From
Yorkshire to Norfolk this sturdy, upstanding stock
took root and thus the bloodstream of these vigor-
ous individualists, proud and successful men of
the sword, mingled henceforward in the English
race, a vivifying, potent, lasting and resurgent
quality".

There is no denying the terror let loose by
the Vikings in western Europe and elsewhere.
Thousands of people were killed or forced into
slavery. Thousands of widows all over Europe
had reason to curse the Vikings of Scandinavia.
But naturally these bloodthirsty expeditions
claimed thousands of Danish lives too, either
slain or drowned; and despite the fact that these
dead had nobody to blame but themselves, the
events as seen from Denmark's side on the home-
front were often dismal enough, And there were
widows in Denmark too, standing along the beaches
every autumn, staring vainly out to sea as ships
returned home - or did not return, Many tomb-
stones were raised in Denmark for Danes who
never returned with their ships, Kipling caught
the picture in his 'Harp Song of the Dane Women!":

"What is a woman that you forsake her
and the hearth-fire and the home-acre
to go with the old grey widow-maker ?"

Denmark's adventure of a thousand years ago
may appear as a brief, confused episode to the
descendants of that country called the British
Isles; peopled by ancient Britons, invaded by
Celts, then conquered and occupied by the Romans
for 400 years, then invaded and conquered by
Angles and Saxons, then by Danish Vikings, and
finally by Norman Knights under William the
Conqueror, their origin is so tangled that they
can scarcely be blamed if they are not excited
