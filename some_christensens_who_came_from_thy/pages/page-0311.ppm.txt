Brown Kit 292

the winters, Soon a larger house was erected
just south and west of the old one and both places
were used to house the large Christensen family
in winters for a year or so until the new house
could be completed. This house was built mostly
of.rock hauled from the quarry north of Gunnison
cemetery. Eventually the new house boasted three
good sized rooms besides a kitchen and pantry on
the ground floor plus one large unfinished and two
small finished rooms in the attic upstairs, used
for sleeping, .Whether the new rock house was
sufficiently completed in time to welcome Laurs'
and Else's second pair of twins is not known, but
that they were born in one or the other of those
two houses on the corner of first north and second
west in Gunnison is a certainty,

These second twins, a boy anda girl, were
born at 4 o'clock in the morning, Wed, 19 July:
1882, and according to Else's journal.she had no~
attending midwife other than herself, The little
ones were feeble however, and help was sent for
to give them names and blessings, Grandfather
Christen Christensen came and blessed the first
child,. a boy, giving him the name Arthur Marinus
Christensen, Brother John Wasden, a neighbor
from across the street, gave the little girl a bless-
ing and the name Martine Lauriette, the second
name for Laurs, but she died about 12 noon that
same day. And so another little spirit went to join
her sister and others of her departed kin in Para-
dise. The boy Arthur lived and, under the tender
and expert care of his fond mother, grew in health
and strength and wisdom. It was not until Feb. l,
1883, however, that they took him to church for
his official christening,

It is a great thing to deliver ones own twin
babies; but when we consider that Else delivered
at least twenty-six babies in 1882, one of them a
daughter for Hans Jensen just six days before her
twins came, another a daughter for Lars Myrup
nineteen days after, the picture becomes far more
involved, and we are led to feel nothing but amaze-
ment at the accomplishments of this remarkable
woman. We are not forgetting for a moment either
that when possible she did much of the housework
