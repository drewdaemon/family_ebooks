about us live and tingle in our minds and hearts.
She gave us new eyes, new ears, new understand -
ing. And while she entertained and delighted us,
she taught and disciplined in poetry, song and
story. She ran the gamut of noble emotions from
the simple to the sublime, and we followed along.
She tuned the strings of our creative impulses and

ool Christmas program when I was
in fact, the Christmas we first spent
in our new home. She dictated the last part of it
to me while she was mixing bread the morning just

years since then her descendants, to the third
generation, have retold this Christmas poem at as
