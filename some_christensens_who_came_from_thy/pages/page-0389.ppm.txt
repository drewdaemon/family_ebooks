Yesterday's Windows 366

the feeling of utter loss can come to a four year
old, I felt bereft and sobered. I had loved this
older brother with all the tanacity of my little soul.
The feeling lasted for years. Father, of course,
broke off his studies and returned from Europe
immediately following the news of Adelbert's

Electricity hadn't come to Gunnison by June
1907, which was the time Elsie and Alma moved
from Fayette into the beautiful new red brick house
there that they had purchased from the sheepman,
Lafe Bown. Most everyone used the common coal-
