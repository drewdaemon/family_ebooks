the Mt. Olivet Cemetery there. This was indeed
a sad time for the A. M. Christensen family.

(9) ELVENA CHRISTENSEN (CLARK)

Elvena, eleventh and last child and ninth
producing branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K.
Christensen family, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah 27 Mar. 1887. She was born in the "new rock
house" in northwest Gunnison, According to
information recorded in her mother's journal she
was born about 9 o'clock at night on a Sunday. Her
mother also recorded that she was blessed and
named at home the 7th of April by Norien, (This
last is hard to read and perhaps misspelled.) She
also recorded that the child was taken to church
for her official blessing and naming, 23 Dec. 1889,
which was done by Bishop A. C. Madsen, The
name given her, Elvena, was according to an old
Danish custom of naming children - viz: If the
eighth child was a boy he was named Otto, if the
eleventh child was a girl she was named Elevena,
etc, Elevena was shortened to Elvena in this case
but she was later called ''Vena"' more often than not,

Elvena's mother was a trained doctress and
midwife and her time was much in demand in
Gunnison Valley. Thus the child was often left in
the care of other members of the family. When
she was one year and two months old, her mother
brought home another little baby girl to raise, Ada
Lorena Madsen, two months and twelve days old,
Elvena's mother had delivered the little girl and
taken care of her and her mother during the long
period of the mother's illness. Knowing that she
would die, the young mother had begged the older
woman to take her baby and raise her as her own,
So when Ada's mother passed away, Elvena's
mother brought little Ada to the Christensen home
to live. The two babies, blond, healthy Elvena
and dark haired, sickly little Ada took to each
other right away and became almost inseparable
as the days and years went by,
