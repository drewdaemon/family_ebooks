impression that it was best to leave them alone.
Yes, Christen the elder was mighty proud of his
forebearers, those stalwart peasant Danes from
Thy. He was grateful too for the part they had
played in building and preserving the kingdom.

It would have been easy to have failed in the

there upset. The Danish Kingdom herself had
been thrown into a state of discouragement, She
was bankrupt and had lost the control of Norway
besides; but above all she had lost her great Dano-

world, next to England's, In fact, the country was
