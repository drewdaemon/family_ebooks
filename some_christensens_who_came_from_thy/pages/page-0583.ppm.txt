together without your mother", he said gently -
"We must be brave.'! Childhood took leave of me
then and never returned, Father was never quite

Albert continued to serve as District Judge
until his term ran out in 1917, but declined to stand
for renomination although both parties indicated a
desire to place him on their tickets, His duties as
Judge necessitated long absences from home and
he felt he needed to be near his five motherless
children, So he brought his energies back to the
private practice of law, the running of sheep, the
operation of his two ranches plus some semi-

After Jennie's death his sister Vena came
into the home for a time to assist him. Then
Jennie's sister, Retta Neff, came to help and

left to carry on alone - but not often, After nearly
four years of this, Albert found a wonderful help-
mate in Miss Myrtle Farnsworth, the Domestic
Science teacher in the local High School and a
younger sister of Ida, lovely wife of Edgar T.
Reid, who lived neighbors across the road.

Albert and Myrtle were married in the St,
George Temple, 23 June 1920. She was almost
thirty-five and he was forty-seven and a half. His
children lovingly called her Aunt Myrtle from then

"Starr Ranch'', Myrtle understood about it before
their marriage, since Albert had told her that if
the venture succeeded, all would be wonderful, but
that if it failed he would be literally ''wiped out",

Albert's brother, Andrew, had interested him
in this venture, a large ranch in Juab County north
of Nephi, the possibilities of which, to Andrew at
least, seemed enormous, Though Albert was not
as enthusiastic as the less conservative Andrew,
