Christen Christensen himself had been born
29 July 1817 in the small scattered farm vai leee ie
of Flarup, known earlier as: Flarupgaard (''gaar
meaning farm in Danish). It is situated a.few
miles east of the town of Gettrup, midway cag hte
there and the larger town of Ydby, just.oyer the
line into Ydby Parish. His father had been born 5
in the same village, .as had his father's father. and
mother also; in fact, all of his progenitors,, at
least back to the year 1592, both male and female,
had been born within a radius of not more, than ten
miles from Flarup (Ydby, Dover, Gettrup, Helligso,
Kobberod, etc.), or in Flarupgaard itself. F
Christen felt pretty certain, however, that .all of
his forerunners had lived in that selfsame area
since before the time of the Vikings, even from
the beginning of habitation there.
