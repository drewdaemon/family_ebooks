627 Arthur

Arthur's first several summers were spent
with his parents and brothers and sisters in
Christenburg where his father had leased a farm.
The boy was often left in the charge of his older
brothers and sisters, since his mother was a
doctor and midwife and her services were much
sought after in Gunnison Valley.

When of proper age he entered the public
schools at Gunnison, which convened within a few

great family to work together and help each other
out.

Arthur was ofa gentle, kind and patient
nature, like his father. He had a happy disposition
and was easy to get along with. That his older,
fun-loving brother Louis sometimes took advantage
of this to involve him in 'pranks" can well be
imagined. (A few of these have been related
earlier in the book.) That their youngest sister,
Elvena, often became a victim of their mischief:
we can be sure. But Arthur grew to manhood a
hard worker, dependable and loving life. -

_ Arthur's parents, but more particularly his
mother, had a great desire that their children
become well educated. Most of his older brothers
and sisters had gone on to school following their
