Albert 542,

working after school, and without selling most of
what he had in Gunnison, including the treasured
horse and buggy, nor without deeply appreciated
financial help from his wonderful brother Chris "I,"

Back in Utah the summer of 1899, Albert
"hung up his shingle'' in Manti. A dream of long
standing was about to come true. And yet another
dream was in the making, for soon he was intro-
duced to Miss Virginia Snow, or ''Jennie''as her
friends all knew her, The two began dating and a
wonderful courtship followed, Some proud moments
came for Albert when he escourted ''Miss Snow'' to
his hometown of Gunnison and she presented a
dramatic, patriotic reading at the annual community
Fourth of July celebration of 1900. She was so
dainty, vivacious and talented,

Albert took Jennie to the Manti Temple, 26
Sept. 1900, and made her his own "leading lady",
Sometime in October they moved into their own
two-story brick home at 155 North 2nd West, which
Albert had been able to completely pay for and
furnish, due to his having been selected to take
care of the legal work pertaining to the settlement
of some one hundred claims brought on by the
tragic Scofield coal mine disaster,

Those were mostly bright years as Albert
and Jennie walked together through the corridors
of an exceedingly happy marriage; as they brought
forth their five beloved children; and as he became
a highly respected lawyer, County Attorney, and
finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court,
comprising Sanpete, Carbon, Emery, Grand and
San Juan counties, I recall the salary was $4, 000
a year - quite a sum for those days.

Those were the days when lawyers went about
their precincts in buggies, buckboards, or on
horseback with law books tied to their saddles,
During his judgeship Albert traveled by horse-
drawn stage, train, and the automobile. Price,
the County Seat of Carbon, was then at the zenith
of its riproaring history and his calendar was
filled with many sensational criminal trials, along
with the important civil ones,

As Albert prospered he bought sheep and land.
