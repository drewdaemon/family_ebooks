that is why Iam going to go on working as long

"We went through the temple in Salt Lake
11 Sep. 1968 and were married for eternity, after
having taken the Project Temple course. We are
so happy about this. We only wish that our child-
ren were sealed to us, but perhaps someday they
too will see the importance of it and prepare them-
selves for this great blessing. At least we have
now made a start in the right direction and set the
example for them.''!
