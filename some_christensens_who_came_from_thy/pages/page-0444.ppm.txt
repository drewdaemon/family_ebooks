Prophecies Fulfilled 420

in Roskilde, Copenhagen Amt, or County, Denmark,
Skjalm Hvide had married the Princess Signe
Haroldsen, daughter of King Harold IV of Denmark,
or Harold ''Hen" as he was anciently known, and

his wife Margrethe. Laurs helped Else by doing

the work for her male relatives, including old
Skjalm Hvide. He also did work for some of the
male dead of Brother Joseph Carpenter's, as has
been mentioned, and for others, by which means

he earned a modest living. It helped some in
regards to their living when, by a Government act
of March 4, 1917, Laurs became entitled to a

small pension amounting to $20.00 per month pay-
able quarterly, for his service in the Black Hawk
Indian War as a ''Private in Captain John H. Tuttle's
Company, Utah Militia Infantry."

-Laurs and Else must have started out house-
keeping in their new location with mostly brand new
furniture and equipment, or at least what was new
to them, though some may have been second hand.
Interestingly enough, an itemized bill for furniture,
rugs, etc,, purchased about the time of their
moving, was found among their papers in the Old
Brown Kit. It was from the Michigan Furniture
Company, 430-36 South State Street, Salt Lake
City, Utah and reads as follows:-- "Buffet - $35, 00;

In my minds eye I can see now some of this
furniture and the way it was placed in that old
adobe house on West Union Street. Ican still see
also, in memory, some of the other things that
were there which helped to 'dress up!'' that house
and make it Grandpa's and Grandma's:-- dark red
plush covered, gilt edged Family Albums full of
photos of strange people resting on the library
