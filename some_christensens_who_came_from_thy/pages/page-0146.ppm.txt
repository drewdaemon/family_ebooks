are all nestled in the southern part of that region
often referred to as Thyland, or ''Thy'', the lower
half and most western part of far North Jutland,
which is cut off from the rest of it by the beautiful
Limfjord, that unexpectedly meandering, lengthy
fjord which runs diagonally across the peninsula
east and west, from the Kattegate to the North Sea.
Carved out during the Ice Age, when the receding
glaciers formed the landscapes, this largest of
Denmark's numerous fjords which enhances the
graceful smiling and more fertile part of Thy, is
so studded with inlets, coves, bays and sister
fjords, into which its blue water enters, as to be
almost unbelievable! The fjord itself is framed

in picturesque bluffs and flats, although the scenery
around it is varied, and its shores harbor many cozy
smaller towns, as well as Thisted, the largest of
those in Thy, also the large city of Aalborg, some
distance northeast of this region. The waters of
the Limfjord also surround Mors, a good-sized
green island of scenic beauty which contains some
of the loveliest scenery in Denmark; containing
also many pleasant towns and villages, particularly
the ancient historical city of Nykobing and the town
of Feggeklit, the place where Prince Hamlet, the
Danish legend says, killed his uncle King Fegge,

in revenge for the murder of his father, Horvendil,

Thy is mostly a flat region of wide horizons
and great contrasts, Very near Flarup and west
of Hurup is the highest point in the entire region,
300 ft. above sea level, offering a beautiful view
of the area. Giant chalk formations are found in
some areas, especially in the most northwestern
part at Hanstholm, where is also one of the
strongest lighthouses in the world, overlooking the
North Sea, and built during Christen's time in 1842.
Some of the slopes along the Limfjord are rich with
moler, a clay found hardly anywhere else in the
world, It is best seen south of Thisted, where
- many layers of volcanic ashes are visible in the
clay. From this clay, light, porous bricks for
insulation are made and exported to many countries,
To the west and north, Thy is bordered by the
cruel North Sea, which has been eating away at
the land for centuries, carving out and swallowing
well-off farms and even whole villages, or covering
