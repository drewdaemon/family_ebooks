and used to play for dances in Upton and that area
before he was married. They say he played the
banjo well, was excellent on the harmonica, could
chord on the organ and piano, and could sure play
the mandolin like a professional. Though he had
never had a muSic lesson in his life he could play
any piece of music that the dance band played.

George worked in the mines in Juab County
for almost thirty years, In fact, he worked there
until the mines closed down about 1950. Ata
large celebration held in Payson, honoring men of
long and outstanding service to Mining at that
time, George was presented with a pin for his fine
contribution. But he worked in the mines too long
as far as his health was concerned, Breathing the
poor air and dust in the mines so long brought on
silicosis which caused his death, 12 Apr. 1951, at
age sixty-four years ten months and six days.

George was buried 16 Apr. 1951 in the Goshen
cemetery. Two weeks later, upon the advice of
and after serious consultation with his doctor, a
lawyer, and his mother who was hard to convince,
his son George arranged to have his father's body
exhumed and an autopsy performed to prove the
nature of the condition that caused his death.

From the report of those who examined him it was
possible to file a claim with the Industrial Com-
mission which eventually paid his mother a lump
sum plus small monthly payments thereafte rl
which helped her so much at that time. But an
unusual thing happened during the time the body
was being examined. Some of George senior's
own relatives, who had been unable to attend his
funeral, came to the Goshen cemetery to visit his
grave and found nothing but a gaping hole beside
his marker. They immediately called on Vena and
made things very difficult for her at the time.
