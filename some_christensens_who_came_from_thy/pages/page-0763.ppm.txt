assistance of my many wonderful Christensen
cousins and their descendants in this project has
made it more than worth while. I feel that the
descendants of Laurs and Else K, Christensen

have grown closer together in spirit and under-
standing. What more could Task? I couldn't

have done either of these books without the unselfish
help of my fine husband - he has gone along with. me
every step of the way.

Dan and I continue to find happiness and
satisfaction in the programs of the church, We
marvel at its growth and fulfillment of prophecy.
The Gospel of the Master is still our guide and
‘inspiration, Yet abundant joy comes to us from ©
association with our five outstanding children and
twenty-six lovely grandchildren and we cannot help
but feel that they are perhaps our greatest assets
in this life. We have complete confidence that
these cherished family relationships will continue
beyond mortality and will weather all else that ©
may stand between earth life and the eternities -
forever. How else could there be Heaven there
for us? :
