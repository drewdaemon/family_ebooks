(54) Margaret Christensen (2) youngest of the
children in this branch of the family, was born 27
May 1919 in Hinckley, Millard, Utah. Gleanings
from her life's history have been gathered mostly
from her brothers and sisters, although she herself
has contributed a few choice glimpses of her early
years. She writes: ''My Papa was one of the
grandest persons I have ever known. He loved us
children but always expected us to be well mannered
and respectful. He could be stern when he had to
be, but he could also be jolly and fun to be with.
During the few short years that I was privileged to
know him he furnished me with some of my most
vivid and cherished memories and most valued
lessons of my childhood,

"'Papa' was the title which Father wished to
be called by his younger children, My friends all
called their fathers 'Daddy' and often teased me
for using such an old fashioned name as 'Papaâ€™.
