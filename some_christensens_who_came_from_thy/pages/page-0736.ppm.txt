687 Giles Elmer

farm in Cedar Valley. One night in early October
I dreamed, or imagined I saw Father standing in
the door of my tent. Though he said nothing I knew
something was wrong. The next day they brought
me word of the accident that caused his death. I
was eighteen at the time. After his death I con-
tinued to work for the Bennion Livestock Company
herding sheep for awhile and then I went into the
army. After the war was over I went to work in
the mines, first at Ruth and then at Ely, Nevada,

"It was in Ely, Nevada in 1929 that I married
the widow Frances, or "Fannie' Tanfield Marsh,
She had three children by her first husband--Jack,
Don and Mary Marsh, Ididn't adopt them, Fannie
died in 1932 so I left Ely and went to work in the
mines in Colorado at Alma, Fair Play and Lead-
ville mines, From there I went to California,
Then I joined the army again and was in it from
October 1942 until February 1944. Iwas stationed
on the island of Honolulu in Hawaii. Iwas a cook
there for about a year so I was made a Sergeant.

"I then came back to California, I drove
truck here in Los Angeles for E. Willardson
Plumbing Company for twenty-six years and then,
after they went broke, I went to work for F, C.
Schilling Plumbing Co. and worked for them for
three years, I remarried here a widow by the
name of Mrs, Norah Kathleen Makerove. She
doesn't like the name of Norah so we call her 'Kay'.
She had a five year old son, Ronald Makerove,
whom I raised as my own for eighteen years,
although I never adopted him,

"My life isn't very exciting now for a few
years back they sent me to the hospital with heart
trouble, (He also has emphysema). Now they
won't let me work so I have retired and just putter
around with the flowers here onthe place and am
getting fat and lazy. Inthe First World War I was
known as Giles Elmer and in the Second World War
as Elmer Giles. Now I hardly ever hear either of
these names as everyone down here calis me Chris,!!

Elmer is the only one of the Christensen
descendants to have served in both great world
