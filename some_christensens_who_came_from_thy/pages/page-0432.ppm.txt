Prophecies Fulfilled 408

grandmother to the temple again at various times,
as Pearl and I were, to be baptized for some of our
Danish relatives of long ago.

Nevertheless Laurs and Else didn't bury
themselves in temple work entirely but succeeded
in doing some of the other things they enjoyed, Else
especially loved to visit her friends - and she had a
host of them. In earlier days she went by horse |
and buggy. Crystal Snow Witbeck remembers when
"Sister Else Christensen used to stop in at Sterling
on her way back and forth from Manti to Gunnison,
to visit my mother, Anne Marie Nielsen Snow, and
get a 'cold glass of buttermilk', Father, Franklin
Snow, would unhitch her horse and water it in the
creek by which we lived and feed and care for the

her ''wonderful children" and the fine marriages
they had made - you know how proud mothers are

on this particular occasion a certain sister so-and-
so, whom she was visiting, being perhaps a bit
jealous or at least hoping to take her friend Else
"down a peg or two", finally got in her say, -- 'Ja,
Ja, but Vena you vil haf alvays vit you!'' You see
Elvena was getting on in years and not yet wed,

Some of Laurs' and Else's greatest joys in
later years came from visiting their children and
their families. Cousin Byron remembers that his
grandparents often came from their home in Manti
to visit at their home east of Gunnison, ''At first
they came by horse and buggy,'' said Byron, "and
whenever we saw Grandma coming we'd go out and
kill a big fat hen, for we knew she'd want to make
