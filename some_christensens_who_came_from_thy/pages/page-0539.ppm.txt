She was allowed to return to her parents'
home in Fayette for the birth of her first child and
son, Adelbert. Her first daughter, Edith (Edythe)
arrived while her husband was working for his
Masters degree at Ann Arbor, Michigan at the
turn of the century. Her third child, Wendell,
was also born at Fayette. The following year she
and the children were living in Provo, Utah while
Andrew was studying in Germany, when their child
Adelbert died of diphtheria before his father could
return. Her fourth child, Sheldon, was born in
Salt Lake City at the beginning of a happy and suc-

there, It was three years after moving to Salt
Lake that her fifth child, Elsie Eliza, was born,
and less than two years later that this little one
was drowned and taken from her.

life. It was in Germany that her sixth child and
last son, Luther, was born (Leipzig). In Europe
she joined her husband in living or traveling in
England, Denmark, Germany and France (Paris)
while he was studying there. The day before they
were ready to return to the States, after a little
over a year in Europe, baby Luther was stricken
with pneumonia, Through prayer, and the skill of
a kind German doctor, the child was healed and
made the long return trip without further harm."
How grateful Sarah must have been to be spared
another parting with one of her remaining little
ones,
