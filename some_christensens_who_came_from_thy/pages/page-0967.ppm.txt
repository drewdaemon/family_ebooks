devoted my time and energy to my profession,
which is in the field of teaching. nutrition to both
the public and in schools.

went to California where I received my MPH (the
equivalent of a Doctor's degree in my field), from
the University of California at Berkeley. I went

arrived by boat 14 Sep. 1953. Thus I have lived

_in New. York, Hawaii and California, which is now
my. home, and loved them all.

My civic services have been in connection with my
work in national and local organizations. I have no
desire to set the world on fire but live a quiet life
with my hobbies, friends and work,"
