(43) Phillip Van Buren Christensen (4) was
born 23 Oct. I9IT in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He
writes of his own life thus:-- "I was told that when
I was blessed (7 July 1912 by Joseph H. Carpenter)
Iwas given about all of the family names that were
left over on my mother's side of the family. â€˜This
has been quite a name to carry and I wonder so
often if I have done it justice. I remember very
little of my early childhood although I remember
- generally my mother who died when I was nearing
age five.

"When she died I was very lone some. and
missed her greatly. I recall shortly after her.
death having beentold that she had. gone to Heaven.
We had a beautiful staircase in our,home in Manti
and I remember I climbed onto its,second landing
on a beautiful moonlight night and looked. out of the
small ornamental window to the east, there and .
knew that I could see my mother's face up there
by the moon, I also recall another time when I.
felt so alone without her that I somehow got outside
on acold, snowy night and trailed over to Aunt |
Claytie Riddle's in foot deep snow in my bare feet
and nightgown, looking for Mother.

"T always wanted a horse and though, as I
grew bigger, I usually had the use of one of.
Dad's - Prince, Duke, Queen, Pigeon, Nig,
Brownie, Stride-on, etc., yet Inever recall
