485 Christian

twelve years later her younge st son passed away,
lacking three months of his eighteenth birthday,

9 Jan. 1930, Christian had been well insured and
owned much property, which was soon sold. His
part of The Oasis, where he died, was purchased
by his brother Louis. The family would have been
left in fairly good circumstances had not the tender
hearted Caroline made some rather substantial
loans for which, through unforeseen circumstances,
she was never reimbursed. She herself died 8
June 1941, two months and one day following her
Seventieth birthday, having outlived Christian

over twenty-three and a half years, during which
time she continued to live in her own home in Salt
Lake City. Following is part of an article which
was published in the Deseret News at the time of
her death.
