835 Imelda Peterson

by the third and now our two children, What do I
do about our genealogy?"

Though not too strong or not always in good
health, Imelda has worked a lot outside the home
from time to time, She sold Child Craft and World
Book for awhile and was also a saleslady for other
things. She has worked in hospitals and at private
nursing. Her husband passed away in December
1963 in Los Angeles after a long and painful illness,
He was nearing his seventy-sixth birthday, Since
then Imelda has done the best she could in providing
for her family.

Ada brings her sister's story up to date in
these words:- ''Imelda dear is busy in her way too,
Much sickness has been her unhappiness, Her
husband died of cancer and her daughter Karma
developed brittle diabetes at the age of twenty and
has been in and out of the hospital. She is so
gifted in art, music and creative ability - it seems
a shame to have her thus handicapped. Her son
Chad is a fine chap and now works for Standard
Oil. Today Imelda is a registered practical
nurse and employed by Eddie Albert, the TV and
motion picture star, to care for his aged father.
She is active in Relief Society and Sunday School."
