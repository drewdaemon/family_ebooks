While Else was busy with her medical prac-
tice, Laurs took a great deal of the responsibility
of the family. They nearly always had a hired girl
and especially one, Christine or "Sena" Lund of

Else's garden'and she was a fine gardner. She
weeded, tended and fussed over the garden and
tried to have the first new potatoes, green peas,
green onions, and radishes each year, and she
usually did,
