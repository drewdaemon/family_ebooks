739 Ellen Elaine

vegetating in a rocker; rather I would have my days
continue with health, purpose and diverse conflicts
and contrasts that will keep me searching, exper-
iencing, relenting and accomplishing. I would be
about my many yet unlearned lessons, I'm looking
forward to the day when, either from my rocker
or my eternal mansion, when my children can
forget my failings and weaknesses and can bring

to pass the promise given to me in a comfort
blessing by Brother Joseph A. Cornwall in 1932,
in which he said: â€˜Your children will grow up and
honor and bless your memory, They will be proud
in time to claim that they are called of your name,
They will proclaim to the world in beautiful terms
your service to them, your comfort to them, your
blessing to them, and your desires of them for
their good in the earth. '"
