period, and more recently Joseph and Albert had
been employed, helping to build the grade between
Sterling and Gunnison and saving what they could
of their wages in hopes of being able to attend the
Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah.

This dream became a reality for them and
others of the Christensens, as told in the auto-
