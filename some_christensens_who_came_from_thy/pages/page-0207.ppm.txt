which they thoroughly enjoyed; but a young man of
their company who, being a good swimmer, ven-

At 4 p.m. they continued their journey through
the state of Missouri, the land where the Saints in
the early days of the church suffered so much per-

after having traveled by jerks and shakings all
night during which the engine broke down and they
