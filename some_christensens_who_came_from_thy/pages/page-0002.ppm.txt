ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I desire to record my appreciation to a few
of the numbers of people on whom I have depended
for information and inspiration in the writing of
this book, without whose assistance it might never
have been accomplished. MANY THANKS. ,

First of all to my patient husband, Daniel M., for
time and quiet in which to write, and any and all
else I desired of him; to my children and brothers
and sisters for their confidence in me; to my many
wonderful Christensen cousins who have so willingly
helped; to a nephew, Bryce Christensen, for trans-
lations, etc.; to a native Dane, Gunnar Christensen,
for advice on Denmark; to a friend, Evelyn Lord,
for typing and forebearance; to certain individuals
who have written about Denmark, particularly the
Danish author Palle Lauring for his "A History of
the Kingdom of Denmark", as well as former
Church Historian, Andrew Jensen, for his ''History
of the Scandinavian Mission", from each of which

I have gleaned much information and quoted freely;
and last but not least, thanks to Ib Permin of Andr.
Fred. Host & Son of Copenhagen, Denmark for
permission to use excerpts from the English trans-
lation of Mr. Lauring's book, published by that

company.
