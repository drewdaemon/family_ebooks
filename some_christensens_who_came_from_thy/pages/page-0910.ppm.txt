two quarters and again ran the farm. The third
year I went two quarters to the University of Utah
and then came back to work on the farm. By this
time my brother Sherman was married and he and
Lois kindly invited me to come back and stay with
them, so I took the bus to Washington D. C. I
took some training at the Boyd Business University
in shorthand and typing, worked at the Hot Shoppe
