Elvena 660

brothers and sisters who hadn't yet had her temple
work done and this had worried her more as time
went on and the children grew older. It took a near
tragedy in George's and Vena's lives, however, to
get them to the temple, Tresia tells of this: -
"The spring my oldest sister Vera was married
(Apr. 1938) on Easter Sunday, Iwas with a group
of young friends in a car when we had a terrible
accident. I was badly injured and not expected to
live for a time, my face being cut almost from
ear to ear and other damage. Iwas unconscious
for quite a period and the first time 1 saw my
father, after regaining consciousness, I told him
that I was concerned that he and mother had not
been to the temple to be sealed for eternity. This
seemed to be constantly on my mind after the acci-
dent and I remembered mother worrying about my
sisters Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she
and Dad had us children sealed to them, I exacted
a promise from Dad at that time that they would
prepare to go to the temple before my eighteenth
birthday,

"My parents did prepare themselves and
were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in
Manti and have their temple work done and us
younger children sealed to them for eternity, the
very day before my eighteenth birthday - 27 May
1940. I know how happy they will be when all of
their children are sealed to them and we can be
together as a family in the world where they have
gone. They made many sacrifices for us and the
least we can do now for them is to prepare our-
selves by righteous living to join them in the
eternity."

Vera writes: - ''Mother and Dad went through
the Manti Temple the day before Tresia's eighteenth
birthday and had the six younger children sealed to
them, Alta and I were too old at the time, Cousins
Byron and Mildred went through the temple with
them and then they all came over to Ephraim where
Ivan, I and our first son were living at the time and
I had dinner ready for them. Byron brought ice
cream for everyone for the occasion. Mildred said
she bet I'd never dreamed that I'd be cooking my
parents' wedding dinner someday!"
