55 Emigration

for the purchase of equipment for the journey
across the plains, such as handcarts, wagons,
oxen and provisions. In 1865, due to the inflation
brought on by the Civil War in America, the price
of everything was higher there. A wagon that year,
at the outfitting places, was about $200.00 in
greenbacks or $100.00 in gold, and a team of oxen
sold for about $150.00 on the average.

An amuSing story is told of a group of
Danish emigrants of 1853, on the American Plains
near Keokuk, Iowa, where they had received their
oxen and wagons for the journey westward:--''Some
of the Danishmen, disliking the American way of
driving oxen in yokes, hitched up their beasts of
burden in regular Danish fashion, But they had
forgotten one thing--the oxen were American,
The poor beasts were half frightened to death and
started out ina wild run. A council meeting was
called in which it was decided that it would be
easier for the emigrants to learn American ways
than it would for the oxen to work with Danish har-
nesses, Too many of the oxen had never been hitched
up before and this, coupled with many inexperienced
drivers, soon added up to many upset wagons in”
gullies and ditches."

Indeed, all was not roses! Though anti-
Mormon opposition died down in Denmark for a
few years, in 1860/61 it again rode high in some
parts of that country, especially in northern =
Jutland. It became impossible once again for the
Saints to hold public meetings there. -Fuel was
added to the flame of hostility when it became
known that a group of Scandinavian emigrants had
apostatized, in 1862, near Omaha, Nebraska, on>
their way to Zion, They wrote many-false reports
back and numbers of their letters wére printed in
Danish newspapers with relish, Some of the sec-
tarian priests reprinted the letters in tract form,
adding their embellishments, and feélings against
the Mormons raged, Elders and Saints alike
were mistreated because of these malicious reports,
The renewed rantings against the Restored Church
however only accelerated its successes; baptisms
increased in the Mission and so did emigration,
Who wanted to remain in Denmark and be treated
