War Whoops 208

was done at a meeting held in Salt Lake City April
iz, 1852, where appointment of officers was made
and Daniel H, Wells chosen as Lieutenant General,
The defense of the people of Utah and the protection
of their property became the major concern of this
organization, Much vigilance and tact was called
for by the Legion members.

In spite of the subduing of Walker and his
warriors, who had vowed their war would last
until all the whites were exterminated, and in spite
of the peace treaty they had signed with Brigham
Young in May 1854, the stealing and killings went
on, causing much destruction of livestock and some
loss of human life. Indian attacks on travelers and
settlements usually came when least expected; for
example: June 4, 1858 - Jens Jorgensen and wife,
Jens Terkelsen and Christian E. Kjerulf were
massacred in Salt Creek Canyon while traveling
unarmed to Sanpete Valley; Oct, 15 - the remains
of Josiah Call and Samuel Brown of Fillmore were
found near Chicken Creek bridge in Juab County -
the mutilation of their bodies proved it was the
work of redmen; Mar. 22, 1860 - the Overland
mailcoach was attacked by Indians near Eight Mile
Station, Tooele County, with Henry Harper, the
driver, being killed and a passenger wounded;

May 28, inthe same county, Indians attacked the
mail station at Deep Creek, shot a man and stole
several horses; July 22, Smithfield, Cache County
was attacked by Indians and a fight ensued during
which John Reed and Ira Merrill and two Indians
were killed and several on both sides wounded;
Apr. 12, 1863 - a band of about fifty Indians, led
by Chief Little Soldier, attacked a group of soldiers
from Fort Douglas who were camped at Pleasant
Grove, Utah County, who frightened them away
with a small cannon but lost their horses, blankets
and supplies in the fray; June 10 - Wood Reynolds
and another unarmed man were killed when a stage-
coach was attacked by mounted Indians between
Fort Chittenden and the Jordan in Utah County.

The attacking Indians sometimes wore little cloth-
ing - a breech clout and moccasins being their
uniforms, Some painted their faces black on occa-
sions, but they always had guns, pistols or bows
and quivers of arrows, besides their knives or
