Way of War 28

act: the King pitched his tent on the ramparts in
defiance; a friendiy Holland fleet fought its way
throughto help; women, children, students and
citizens worked side by side and civilians and
troops trained for battle. It was six months
before the city was stormed (10 Feb. 1659) but
the Danes were ready! While the men fought,
women and children loaded muskets, dragged
wooden beams and huge stones to be heaved down
on the heads of the enemy and heated lye and water
to boiling, to pour down if they tried to clamber up.
Hour after hour and attack after attack the Danes
fought tenaciously until the Swedes finally had
enough, At least 3,000 of the invaders died but
only 20 Danes. Copenhagen was free, Denmark
was saved--but the prevailing mood was one of
deepest gloom because of the destitute, crippled
and reduced condition of the nation. The nobles
were blamed for it all but were too enfeebled to
rise up against anybody. So the King considered
this an excellent time to have his full say and,
after astute negotiations, proclaimed himself
"Absolute Monarch" of Denmark and Norway. It

was very unusual but there was no bloody revolu-
tion at all.

About this time the nobles were required to
take definite surnames to be retained by succeeding
generations of their posterity, in lieu of the patro-
nymic pattern of surnaming then in common use in
Denmark; ex. --the addition of the suffix ''sen'' to
the given name of one's father, ifa male, and
"datter' if a female. This new order of naming
was designed to more fully identify the nobilities
and their descendants from the commoners. Kings
had been similarly set apart by nicknames,
heraldic titles or numbers since the beginning.
Peasants were not required by law to discard the

patronymic form until 1828 in most cities and 1856
in general.

Christian V (1670-1699) built up the Kingdom
and gave it a Statute Book of new laws by which he
ruled honestly and well. One of the bloodiest
battles ever fought in all of Scandinavia took place
during his administration, when he and his army
crossed over into Scania to try and win her back
