Emigration 54

example, --''Brent Nielsen was so free in outfitting
his brethren and preparing their passage that he
was warned by the missionaries that some might
accept the money and then apostatize. To Jacob
Bohn, the hymn writer, he said: 'You need never
repay me because you labor for God's Kingdom";
... 'Jens Andersen of Veddern, Aalborg County,
assisted no fewer than sixty of his fellow converts
to immigrate; but, like Moses of old, he was
never permitted to set foot-on the promised land,
as he died enroute on the North Sea in 1862, soon
after leaving his native Denmark";..., "Andrew
Eliason, a well-to-do Swedish land owner, sold
his estate and paid the passage for a hundred of
his Brothers and Sisters in the Gospel to start

out for Zion.'' In 1862, in New York, it was dis-
covered that many of the poorer Saints lacked
funds to continue west, The financially able
Scandinavian emigrants immediately donated
money to assist their less fortunate friends west
to Florence, Nebraska, where they were met by
Church trains with supplies and means to take
them onto Zion, ''A Danish brother, Lars
Petersen, about 30 years of age, who had assisted
about twenty poor Saints to emigrate, was acci-
dently drowned in the 'Weeping Water', a stream
near Wyoming, Nebraska, where he, together with
others, went to bathe. He was buried June 28th
with much expression of sorrow by the sympathizing
Saints.'' These compassionate desires of the
more wealthy of the brethren to help those in

need often made it possible for friends and neigh-
bors to go to Zion together.

The price of emigration seemed high and far
above the reach of many of those who desired to go.
It was announced that for each adult the cost was
150 Rigsdaler ($75, 00) provided one walked across
the plains; but if one wished to share a wagon with
seven other adults it would cost 200 Rigsdaler
($100.00) each. Those expecting to emigrate
under the above terms were to send their money,
names, ages, occupations, dates of birth, etc.,
to their respective Conference presidents, advanc-
ing at the same time 40 Rigsdaler for each handcart
emigrant or 80 Rigsdaler for each one planning to
go by wagon, This money was forwarded to America
