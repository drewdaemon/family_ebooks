Aalborg 166

and 90 American miles from Kobberod, Happiness
was reflected on every face, even the gentle
Karen's; for she was feeling much better than for
several months past, Christen was wearing his
coin lined vest under his coat, but few knew it. He
was taking no chance with the pickpockets, Sena
was still nibbling on her breakfast biscuit, The
young people in the wagon joshed along with the

old farmer who had been hired to drive them to
their destination, Pouline and Trina were all eyes,
and full of questions about everything new they saw
and far too excited to settle down, Soon Karen was
weary of them and begged Christen to stop and let

see in the direction of Norhaa, Laurs reached out
and patted her arm - but said nothing then,

Some six or so miles later they were in
Thisted City, which was by far the largest place
in Jutland. It was then well into the afternoon and,
although they hoped to reach Myrupgaard, in Lild
Parish, before nightfall, they stopped for a time
to rest mainly because of the weary Karen, While
she rested and Christen and the old farmer watered
and fed the horses, Laurs and Else took the three
little girls for a brief stroll through beautiful
Thisted. Maren had other things than sightseeing
to think of since at Myrupgaard, now only some
fifteen miles away, she would again greet her
sweetheart, Lars Myrup. He had arranged for
