Those of us who are living today are witness-
ing the birth of anewera. A far different era than
the one our parents and grandparents knew. The
era into which we were born is about to pass away.
I recall the words of the educator, Max Rafferty:
''Today the hammer of accelerating time is beating
on the great anvil of the world with ever increasing
brashness and insistency, Sparks are flying from
the whole surface. The point of no return is past."

We are indeed approaching a very new and
different world - a challenging world - a wonderful
world - a frightening world; and in this new world
the Christensens who are left have a great heritage
as well as a significant responsibility, As Ihave
assembled material for this book my appreciation
and love for my cousins, relatives and Christensen
progenitors has increased an hundred fold, If I
were to dedicate this book, however, it would be
to my children and grandchildren with deepest
affection. Iam proud and grateful to have been
able to contribute a few measures of understanding
to the lives of those who are to follow, We must
all go forward with firm resolve, devotion and
Courage to make this a better world.
