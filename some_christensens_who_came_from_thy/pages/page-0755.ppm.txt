When I was a small girl Mother often told me
about the visit of a wandering gypsy to our home
while I was yet a babe. When she proudly showed
her first-born off to the visitor, the old woman
offered to tell my fortune, and the words she said
were - 'When they're pretty when they're little
they'll be ugly when they're big and vice versa -
this child will be a beautiful woman!'' Whether
this pronouncement ever really took place or not I
have no way of knowing, yet I believed the story
then with all my heart and it remained in my mem-
ory and helped to buoy me up during my ugly duck-
ling years. AS a woman, however, my mirror has
never reflected ''a beauty" and I have had to be
satisfied with the thought that ''beauty is as beauty
does'', Some have said that I resemble my Danish
grandmother Else in looks, though not in stature.
Be that as it may I was not fortunate enough to
inherit lovely auburn tresses like hers.

When I reflect on my childhood I remember
it as being a wonderful time of learning, achieving,
and being appreciated and loved. Our big new
house into which we moved when I was nine was the
envy of my friends. My sister Elaine and I were
also envied by them because of the time our talented
mother took with us in teaching us singing, drama-
tics and such, and because of the numerous oppor-
tunities we had to ''show off" because of it.

How I loved school! I could hardly wait for
each autumn when the school bell started ringing.
I attended school at Manti from ''Beginners Grade"!
into High School - from the red brick schoolhouse
to the white brick schoolhouse onthe same block.
The day before my eighth grade graduation I
sprained my right thumb playing volleyball at
school and was forced to attend the graduation
exercises with my black-and-blue thumb all
bandaged up.. The hurt to my pride was worse
than the hurt to my digit, and needless to say I
accepted my diploma with my left hand. A little
over a year after that graduation my darling
mother passed away and childhood for me came

to anend too. Life seemed much more serious

after that.
