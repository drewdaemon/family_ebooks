653 Elvena

ponded often during those twenty years, When they
learned that 'Aunt Else'' was returning to Denmark
some of Vena's Danish girl cousins about her age
wrote begging that ''Cousin Elvena" be allowed to
come along. What could have been more wonderful
than for Vena to have made this trip to Denmark
with her parents, especially since her brother
Andrew and his family were also going? Why she
didn't go we do not know. Perhaps she was too
timid, not knowing the Danish language, but more
likely it was because of the great expense of such
a trip.

That autumn, while her parents were still
away, Vena's brother Albert's family was stricken
with scarlet fever. The daughter Elaine came down
with it just as they were preparing to move into a
lovely new home in Manti. They had sold their old
home so Elaine was taken by her mother to her
grandfather Snow's home where they were both
quarantined in for some weeks, Vena's help was
sought and she accepted the responsibility of being
quarantined in with the other three children, Vir-
ginia, Sherman and Hale, nine, five-and-a-half
and three-and-a-half respectively. Albert rented
a large furnished room in a dilapidated rock house
belonging to old Mr, Henry that stood just across.
the fence south of the new house and into this moved
Vena and the three children, Albert was of course
quarantined out of both places, because of his work,
but took care of the extra needs of all,

How well I recall being penned up in that long,
dark room with our beds at one end, a cooking
stove, cupboards and makeshift sink at the other,
and a large round table in between where we ate
our meals and carried on many of our other
activities, This table was centered by a large
fancy kerosene lamp and here Aunt Vena played
solitaire with cards in the evenings after the little
boys had gone to bed, while I worked at pencil
games or read a book, How Aunt Vena loved to
play solitaire! But her sunny disposition and
cheerful ways brightened our lives and kept us
mostly contented in our locked-in condition. The
brightest time of all each day, however, was when
Daddy came with our groceries and special treats
