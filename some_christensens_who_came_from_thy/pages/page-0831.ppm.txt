(24) Arthur Melrose Christensen (8) was
born 22 June 1905 in Gunnison, anpete, Utah, in
the old Gledhill home at 367 West Ist North, which
is still standing (1969). He is reported to have
been a beautiful child, to which his early pictures
testify. The family called him "Rosy". He was
baptized a member of the LDS church 1 Nov. 1913.
He attended school in Gunnison in winters and grad-
uated from High School there. In summers he
helped his father on the farm. Finally tiring of
farming he traveled about doing various jobs and
then settled down in Dividend, Utah, where he took
up mining for the Tintic Standard Mining Co.,
which pursuit he followed for about ten years.

It was while living in Dividend. that he met
his first wife, Reva Giles (b. 30 Jan. 1911, Heber
City, Utah to Franklin Shelton and Acie LuVella
Provost Giles). She was a beautiful girl and they
made a handsome couple. They were married
1 Feb, 1929 in Provo, Utah. Reva (now Mrs.
Kinder) says they announced their marriage to
his family two evenings later in the Eagle House.
Hotel in Manti, Utah, when they attended his
parents' twenty-fifth wedding anniversary party
