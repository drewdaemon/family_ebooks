They had this infant named and blessed at the
church 3rd June by Bishop Ole C, Olsen. He was
a fair child with curly blonde hair, a mischievous
smile and a powerful pair of lungs. It soon became
apparent that he would make his voice heard in the
world,

Else's work with the sick now took her to all
parts of Gunnison Valley. If it was as a midwife

Laurs to the other party.

Their brother-in-law, Lars Myrup, made
one of his two homes in Gunnison available to them
and their brood of seven that early summer, As
far as we can ascertain this small adobe house was
