people here so far, they all seem to think very
well of Mr. Christensen but hold a contrary opinion
of Mr. 'H'. People say that 'H' has a fine wife but
that he is a regular would-be outlaw, that he car-
ries a gun with him continually, and that his boy

is as tough as he is. Taking everything into con-

He was arrested on Monday morning and taken as
a prisoner to Evanston and turned over to the Fed-
