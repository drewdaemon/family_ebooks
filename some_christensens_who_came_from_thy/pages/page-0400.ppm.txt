went back to South Jutland. Kristine comes next,
she is twenty-six years old. She is maid at the
school. Then comes Dagmar who is thirty-one
years old and works in Copenhagen. She was also
home for Christmas vacation. Last comes Signe,
and as you know she too is working at the High
School. She is thirty-two. Then of course there
are us two Old Ones, who are fine when we have
our health but it is a little difficult with that once
in a while. Though we as you know don't earn
money here as you can over there, we still get
along well and hope that it will still be better now
that everybody is going to have equal rights. A
person will get the same right to speak, whether
he be a day laborer or a rich farm owner and
women will get the right to vote now too. I think
they will have some influence, especially on the
matters of schools and public welfare, for as you
know the women have more warm heartedness in
things like that. Yes the times have changed very
much here at home Since you left, and that in most
everything concerned. I wonder how it will be in
another forty years? But I guess it has changed
even more where you live. Ihave read an account
of the train which you traveled by when you went
over there in 1866 - that must have been no joke!
Friendly greetings to the whole family from us

and our children.
