daughter; engaging herself instead with sundry
things in her bedchamber when she was not cook-
ing some of the things Else relished most, in the
kitchen, as if to remind her what she would be
missing once she left there again, If the two did
meet, at meals and the like, the older woman was
silent with high head and evasive eyes; though truly
