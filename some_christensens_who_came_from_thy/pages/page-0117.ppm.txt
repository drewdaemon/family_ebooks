103 Bested

as any man, She was now of slightly more than
medium stature, strong, straight and well-
proportioned; a capable, gifted young woman from
the Vikings way back in a straight line, and from
the nobles too, on her mother's father's side,
Next winter she would be a full fledged teacher

we are all such weak people, and since we can
do nothing for ourselves all is spoiled for us;
everything must be given us from above by the
Great God Father,'' "But we are not puppets",
Else had cried, ''to be moved around by strings.
Ja, we are weak but we can be strong -- so much
in the end depends on us ourselves, Don't you
see that God expects us to strive and sacrifice for
