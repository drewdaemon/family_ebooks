181 Westward

Rocky Mountains which, the good Lord willing,
they would all see before that year's ending.
Could we have listened in and interpréted the
Scandinavian tongue we might have heard some-
thing like this:-- ''Those plates of gold, dug up
from a hillside in America, told of old times
there just like the old stories written on runic
stones in Denmark,"-- ''Ja, ja, Isaw such a
stone once, a peasant ran into it after a rain when
he was plowing a field.'' -- "America seems very
new to:.us but it is as old as the world.'' -- 'Ja, .
the Book of Mormon itself tells the story of the ;
red Indians who lived there long before Columbus
Sailed the seas, and about their religion and their
“ways, just as we have learned about Denmark and
the Vikings in old times,'' -- ''There are still
Indians in Zion now - and on the warpath they say.
'Tis a sure thing we'll see some before we're
through!" -- ''Joseph Smith, the Prophet himself,
shot in a prison, tumbling through a window to die
bravely lying at the base of it in a pool of his own
blood, '' -- 'Nej, the Prophet Joseph is not really
dead, any more than Christ is; though he was
murdered, his spirit seemed to come alive again
in the carpenter and Prophet Brigham Young
whom, if we are lucky, we shall all see in

Zion,'' -- 'Ja, Brigham Young was the one who
led the Saints far from the persecutions of their
enemies across deserts and mountains, the same
way we will go to the Valley of the Great Salt |
Lake where the Saints are building a great city
of their own,'' -- 'Ja, ja, and not only oné valley
but many ~- why all of Denmark could beset
down in the middle of that place they have there
and not be even noticed!'' And so the talk must -
have gone for, once they were caught up in the
spirit and wonder of the Gospel, they could go ©
on and on just like the Restored Church had gone
on even after its Prophet had been murdered,

And surely none of those faithful Saints doubted
but that in America, whose deserts were to
blossom as the rose, they themselves would

find their "Promised Land, "'!
