Phillip Van Buren 862

in Feb. 1936,.I went to law school at
ington University, attending at nights
o'clock to 9:30 and working days for
ment Administration. It was difficult for me to
study late at nights so I used to get up at 4:00
o'clock each morning and do my Studying when my
mind was clear. After school was Out, the early
summer of 1937, I was sent down to work at the
regional field office in Raleigh, North Carolina

for three months. I was able to renta lovely room
in a large southern home.

But I returned to Wash-
ington D, C. for work and school that fall. It was
i nded, with a group from
Utah, a White House reception given by President
Roosevelt, A young lady, who worked in the office
of Congressman J, Will Robinson from Utah, whose
name Ihave forgotten, invited me to go. Although
inever had any high regard for President Roosevelt,
I'll never forget how impressed I was as h

family, his chin o

"T-had an Opportunity to be transfered from
Washington to the regional office in San Francisco
and although My law school

plans had to be changed,
I jumped at the chance. Iwas able to purchase a
1935 Ford four-door Sedan automobile that had been
a taxi, for $200.00. As S0On as school was out the
Spring of 1938, I hauled Out a few
