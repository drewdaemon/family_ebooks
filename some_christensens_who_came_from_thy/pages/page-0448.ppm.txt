Prophecies Fulfilled 424

Jennie died, Aunt Vena lived with us, Albert's
family, as has been stated, About the first part
of July that second summer, however, she was
persuaded to leave and go to Wyoming by Uncle
Chris, who seemed very anxious to get her up
there for some special reason, In fact it was
perhaps Chris himself who took her there on one
of his various business trips back and forth from
Sanpete. It turned out that he was anxious to have
Vena meet a young bachelor from Upton, Utah, by
the name of George T, Clark, who was one of the
herders for the Bennion Livestock Co, As Chris
had observed the character and habits of this man
in his employ he had found him to be an all around
honest, clean, good and fine fellow and was
thoroughly convinced that George would make Vena
a splendid husband, So Chris took Vena to stay
with some of the folks and saw to it that she and
George got together, doing all he could to foster
a match.

It was but a few weeks before Elvena Chris-
tensen and George Thomas Clark were married,
for of course Chris had built each of them up to it
well beforehand, They went to the Uinta County
courthouse in Evanston, Wyoming, 14 Aug, 1917
to secure their license and then sought out the
LDS Bishop to perform the marriage ceremony.
Each of them was thirty years old at the time but
they were as thrilled and happy as a couple of
teenagers,

8. WYOMING INTERLUDE

The part of Western Wyoming in which some
of the Christensens were now living was in the
general area known as Bridger Basin, through
which what was left of a once mighty river wound
its way. Long ago Fort Bridger, from which the
region got its name, was a precious shelter from
Indian's tomahawks - the same Indians who finally
whooped themselves into tame and stupid retreats
on the reservations, Pioneering inthis unmade
country was first begun a hundred years ago by
railroad workers who came to build the Union
Pacific Railroad which now bisects the territory.
