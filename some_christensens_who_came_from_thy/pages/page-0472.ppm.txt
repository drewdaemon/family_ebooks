are sure she departed in the belief of the three-
in-one God (Trinity). We have heard so little
about them since, but it was pneumonia which

took her life. She couldn't stand it with her asthma.
The doctor that came also knew she couldn't live.
It was strange that she should be so far away from
us when the end came, but she had it good with her

Marie"
