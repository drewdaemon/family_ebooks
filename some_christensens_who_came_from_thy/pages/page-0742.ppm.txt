a summer job with still more money from my
employer, Mr, Constantin, which was to introduce
his French candies in connection with a linen shop
in the seaside resort town of Magnolia, Maine. I
lodged at the home of the charming Jewish woman
who tended the Linen Shop, I discovered that fine
minds, noble spirits and kindly hearts are to be
found in many places, regardless of race, rank
or creed. :

"Grace and I found a small one-room apart-
ment withtiny kitchen and bath close to the Con-
servatory of Music where I registered and then
faced the manager in his private office. I did not
have the price of tuition, since the money I had
been promised from home failed to arrive and my
own earnings were insufficient. He waived immed-
iate payment and as the year advanced gave me
every advantage of discount plus a partial scholar-
ship, In return I promised dedicated work and I
kept my promise.

"I took vocal, piano, harmony, solfeggio,
sight reading and history of music, My aim was
to practice from five to six hours aday. I worked
out a tight schedule and stuck to it. Ididn't work
otherwise except at a small job playing piano for
a children's dance studio and as a paid singer at
an Episcopal church on Sunday which came early
enough for me to attend my own church service
later. My health was good and my ambitions high.

"There were a number of other Utahns study-
ing there. Among the male students and LDS
missionaries we did not lack for dates but limited
our dating to one night a week and Sunday afternoons,
We were pretty selective in the things we attended -
operas, concerts, the best in musical comedy,
Shakespeare's plays, etc. I had an invitation to
the Harvard Junior Prom that year - it was quite
an occasion, Saturdays we sometimes went sight
seeing to spots of historical interest or visited art
galleries to browse,

"Though I received a little help from home
occasionally and some from a business friend in
Utah, yet by money standards Iwas 'poor', if not
â€˜in need', although somehow I felt blessed and 'rich'.
