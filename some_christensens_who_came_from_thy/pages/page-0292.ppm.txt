‘We started down across the public square,
then covered with sagebrush, proceeding in Indian
Style, Chris leading the way, Andrew next, then
Joseph, and I toddling along in the rear, I suppose
I felt most secure as I was the last one in order to
meet the wronged Bishop, However, we arrived
at the log home of Hannah, second wife of the
Bishop, Chris knocked rather lightly and, as we

Shaken over the sheets and canvas, When the
containers were filled with berries, it would be

Generally, the winter supply of fruit was obtained
from this source, supplemented by chokecherries,
which were also plentiful inthe hills and lower
