Joseph 530

who died, one right after the other a few weeks
after their births. Her grandmother Christensen
was in attendance at her birth, the dramatic story
of which has been given in an earlier part of this
book, Ruth was always very dear to her parents,
as she has always been to her various brothers
and their families.

'In the early years after her marriage,
Roxie always went back to her childhood home in
Fayette at Christmastime to make things happy
there. She was a jolly sort of person and such
excellent company. She always had some joke or
'Christmas treat', especially made for her brothers,

"Roxie loved to sew. She made everything -
children clothes, fancy dresses, suits, coats,
sweaters, wedding dresses, boys pants, and
numerous sets of burial clothes. She did most of
her mother-in-law Else's sewing and that for Vena
and Tresia until they left the Christensen home.
She kept Ruth Ellen looking like a little princess,
She was a master at 'making things over'., (In fact,
as Ruth Ellen said, ''She was a wonderful seam-
stress"),

"Roxie fed her big family the very best of
food, Joseph and their oldest son, Harold, used
to kill as high as fifty wild ducks in one hunt and
for the season they would supply a set number
every day to a Salt Lake market; killing, cleaning
and dressing them and putting a specified number
on the north going train each day. Joseph and
Roxie cleaned the ducks and as they were busy
cleaning, a cake made ina big black dripper-pan
by Roxie could easily walk out of the house, a piece
at a time, in the hands of her five hungry boys,
She always had room in her house, at her table
and in her heart for 'one more' even if that one
happened to be 'ten'. Alma Fredrickson, a boy
about Harold's age who needed a home, lived at
their home for nine years and became almost like
a son to them and a brother to Harold,

"Following the death of her husband, Joseph,
23 July 1926, Roxie continued to live in their home
just west of Rocky Point with her four unmarried
sons. Myron was married the next spring, 13 Apr.
