525 Joseph

fifty-five years four months and sixteen days old
when he finally retired from his life's labors,
Some said he died of a broken heart, but Myron
said it was thought to have been a bursted stomach
ulcer followed by a number of complications and
ending with pneumonia. He was buried in the
Gunnison City Cemetery 25 July 1926,

His funeral, held on the above date, was well
attended by people from all walks of life. Many
had been his students or co-workers. Here,
among the many other tributes, were read two sets

County one of the members of the Board of County
Commissioners who has devoted not only his labor
and his energy but also his mind and heart to the
doing of tasks imposed on him and voluntarily
assumed by him; Whereas, the nature and character
of the services rendered by Joseph Christensen to
the public in the many capacities in which he has
served were such as to reflect credit on the entire
community and be a splendid example for all
employees to admire; be it .

---Resolved: that we, the officials of Sanpete
County, desire to express officially our admiration
for Joseph Christensen, as a man and as a public
servant; and as a token of our respect and esteem,
that a copy of this resolution be spread upon the
records of Sanpete County and that a copy be pre-
sented to his family, Be it further Resolved, that
we offer our sincerest condolence to Mr. Christen-
sen's family in this hour of their bereavement."!

'Whereas, in the wisdom of our Heavenly
Father, our Brother and class leader, Joseph
Christensen, has been called from this sphere of
action and advanced to a higher sphere where his
splendid talents and powers will not be limited;
and Whereas, his departure has left a vacant place
in the High Priests Quorum which will be hard to
