in it a short time when Herma passed away, 12
May 1940. Iwas single for two years and then I
married a widow, Stella Sorenson Averett. We
met in Salina and were married in Richfield 215
May 1942. She also had several children but she
was wonderful to me and mine.

"IT was on the Gunnison City Council fourteen
board member of the Gunnison Irrigation
Company eight years, treasurer of the City Canal
Company for six years and Watermaster for Many

years also. More recently I was on the govern-
ment appointed commission to buy farms in Sanpete
County for nonmarginal farmers. I served in this
capacity for six years."

Harold's daughter Dorothy pas sed away
following an automobile accident, 29 Aug. 1963.
His second wife, Stella, died rather suddenly 19
Nov. 1967. Harold became rather discouraged
after that and his heart condition of long standing
seemed to get worse. He visited his sister Ruth
Ellen Hansen in California for some weeks around
Christmas. He returned home to the farmhouse
where he and Stella had lived for several years,
the farm itself now being owned by his son Keller
who had built it into one of the finest cattle farms
in the area. Keller and sometimes Cloyd. came
to have breakfast with him every morning. They
found him still in bed Monday morning, 11 Mar.
1968. He had passed away in his sleep during the
early hours. He was buried 14 Mar. 1968 in the
Gunnison cemetery beside his wife Herma.
