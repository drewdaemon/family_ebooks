Elvena 656
Vena and George had decided to get married.

They went to the Uinta county seat at Evanston,
Wyoming for their license and were married there
by the L. D. S, Bishop, 14 Aug. 1917, Both were
thirty at the time. Much of the credit for this mart~
riage could be given to the cupid with reddish
whiskers, Chris ''I''. His daughter Pearl says that
the couple went to Salt Lake City right after their
marriage and spent the first night of their honey~-
moon at her mother Caroline's home. She remem”
bers her mother telling about the large straw hat
Vena was wearing, trimmed with a large bunch of
gay colored artificial flowers. Somehow during the
night the cat got hold of that hat and tore it all to
pieces, and that was the end of Vena's wedding
bonnet.

From Salt Lake they went on to Manti where
Vena showed George off to her Sanpete County rela-
tives, Then it was back to The Oasis in Wyoming,
where they lived with Elsie while George built a
house on Vena's property, a two-roomed log house
with an attic. Chris gave George work on or near
the ranch so that he could be near his new bride.
George helped with the harvesting of the crops 07
Chris' place that fall and he was there when the
crops were burned and, shortly afterwards, when
the wonderful Chris ''I'' was shot and died. He
helped a great deal at that time.

Vena must have gone home to live with her
parents that winter in Manti while George went out
again with the sheep, Returning to Wyoming in
early spring she was able to live in her own log
house, which was not too far from her sister
Elsie's or her brother Louis' log and frame houseS-
George was able to be home off and on but by July
Vena had returned to Manti to be near the help of
her mother for the birth of her first child.

Vera was born in Manti at the home of her
Christensen grandparents, 12 July 1918, and was
delivered by her grandmother Else. Tresia say®
Vena had a very hard time of it, She took baby
Vera back up on the Oasis in Wyoming to live 45
soon as she was able, for she wanted to "prove UP
on her land. It wasn't too long after the end of that
