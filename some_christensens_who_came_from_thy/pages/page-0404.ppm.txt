Destiny Takes a Hand 380

the paper about a month ago that they would have
to work both nights and holidays to get ready by
then. Be sure and tell Anders 'hello' for me.
Maybe he can hardly remember me as you know
Iwas small and not yet confirmed when he was
here, I am now a good sixteen years old. I guess

loving greeting from my husband and me - Marie,"
