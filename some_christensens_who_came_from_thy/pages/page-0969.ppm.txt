Cullen Yates 920

High School there the spring of 1938 as valedictorian
of his class, He was a talented boy, a fine student
and a great reader, He had a beautiful baritone
voice, was good at basketball; in fact most anything
he put his mind to he could do well. Of course he
had plenty of work to do on the small fruit farm
where the family lived, but he found time to fish

and hunt as a boy - and these he loved to do and

still does to this day.

Cullen writes about those early days in
Orem:- 'My most vivid recollections of Dad are
associated with the home in Orem, the fishing and
hunting trips, the family outings, Christmas, and
the law business, I believe Dad really loved that
place in Orem. He always arose early and did a
half days work before going to the office. Inever
could join him in his obvious love for horses and
sheep he kept on the place. Those horses ate con-
stantly and I doubt if he ever rode one. He seemed
to enjoy just watching them and perhaps recalling
his early days in Gunnison and Manti.

"My first recollection of fishing was with
Dad at Fish Lake and Strawberry, particularly
Charlie Madsen's camp at Strawberry. I can still
see the smile on Dad's face when he would bring
out a nice native trout on the big pop-gear.

"The Sunday afternoon picnics at Canyon Glen
and Aspen Grove were great. Mother would always
have such good food and Dad did enjoy games with
us children. Of course Christmas Eve when all the
family would gather was the greatest! Each would
perform in turn and Dad would enjoy every minute

of it..

â€˜Mother was always thinking of others and
doing something for someone else, Maybe she got
more enjoyment out of that than doing things for
herself. I truly believe that I was blessed with
the finest parents on earth,"

Cullen was popular with the girls at Lincoln
High School but he had found a favorite in Daryl
Stewart, atall, slender, pretty, dark haired miss,
And Daryl liked Cullen but her mother objected to
her going steady. His parents seemed to be of the
