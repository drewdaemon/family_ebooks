the call was, I had many faith promoting exper-
iences in the Aaronic Priesthood. I was ordained
an Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood and not
long afterwards, 26 June 1901, I received my
endowments in the Manti Temple and was married
to Elsie Katherine Christensen by John D. T.
McAllister who was then president of that temple.

"We settled in Fayette for several years
where our first four sons were born. Father and
I farmed together. I sold out my interests there
and purchased a new home from Lafe Bown in
Gunnison in the spring of 1907. At this time I
became interested in the sheep business. This
work took me away from home much of the time
and I became careless in my church duties. I
felt I did not have time to work in the church.
Through this carelessness I became indifferent.
Before long reverses came."

Alma's subsequent separation from his
family has been mentioned in Elsie's history.
Alma was working for the Lindsey Land and Live-
stock Company in southern Utah during this time.
He gave up the sheep business to rejoin his family
in the spring of 1918. They settled in Goshen the
spring of 1920 and Alma farmed there for a couple
of years and then worked for Allen's Market. It
was almost like starting from the beginning.
Finally he got a job working for the Tintic Standard
Mining Co. as "timber shopman", The family con-
tinued to live in Goshen until 1931 when they bought
a new home in Payson and moved there, having
rented for those eleven years in Goshen.

Alma eventually got back to working in the
Church and moved from one position of trust and
responsibility to another. A chronology of his
church positions after moving to Goshen follows: -
Nov. 1920, called to labor as 4 local missionary
Tor six months in the Tintic Stake of Zion; 30 Nov.
1931 called as 2nd Asst. to Sunday School Superin-
