Christen Christensen himself had been born
29 July 1817 in the small scattered farm village
of Flarup, known earlier as Flarupgaard ("'gaard"
meaning farm in Danish), It is situated a few
miles east of the town of Gettrup, midway between
there and the larger town of Ydby, just over the
line into Ydby Parish. His father had been. born
in the same village, as had his father's father. and
mother also; in fact, all of his progenitors, at .-
least back to the year 1592, both male and female,
had been born within a radius. of not, more than ten
miles from Flarup (Ydby, Dover, Gettrup, Helligso,
Kobberod, etc.), or in Flarupgaard itself,
_.Christen felt pretty certain, however,. that,all of,
his forerunners had lived in that. selisame area
since before the time of the. Vikings, even. from
the beginning of habitation there,
