War Whoops 230

year towards emigrating all the poor Saints from
Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, No
church teams had been sent to the Missouri River
for the poor that year, because of the Indian trouble,
in consequence of which the immigration of members
to Zion was comparatively small, Anne was anxious
to send money to her sister in Denmark so that she
might come, and Christen promised to get around

to it as soon as he got his feet on his own ground,
Lars Myrup too was eager to have his father and
step-mother and their children come; but it turned

Else's thoughts must also have turned to her people
in Jutland, But it was useless to think of them in

with Colonel Head, Superintendent of Indian Affairs
at the Uintah Indian reservation, he unbosomed him-
self, again expressed a desire for peace and asked
Superintendent Head to cut his hair for him in token
of his abandonment of the warpath, and promised to
induce as many as possible of his adherents to join
him in peace, Preliminaries having been accom-
plished, the proud Chieftain seemed anxious to
make amends to the people of Utah before death
overtook him,

Thus, on April 5, 1868, believing Indian
hostilities were over and that it was safe to return
to their deserted homes, a company of 22 men, 4
boys and 15 wagons started on their way to re-open
the settlement of Monroe in Sevier County. They
had been cautioned against possible Indian attacks
