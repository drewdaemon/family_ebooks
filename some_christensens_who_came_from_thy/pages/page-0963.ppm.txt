something may go wrong. I don't know how come
I tell you all my secrets first unless that is the
way it has always been - huh? Your ever loving
brother, Max.'!!

Max received his appointment to Chief
Pharmacists Mate and also a well deserved
furlough. A news clipping in a Salt Lake paper
of Aug. 19, 1943 tells something of this:- ''To
