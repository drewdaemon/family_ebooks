his ears. He was a member ofthe crew of.the USS
Enterprise, our country's largest carrier. A
letter from him to Gladys in San Francisco, dated
11 Oct. 1941, read as follows; "My Dear Sister
Gladys:- Yes, time does fly before we realize
where it has gone. I am still well, young and
unhappy, and fighting for the day I will be home
again with all of you. I read your letter and when
I came to the part where you said David had joined

A letter from Max to his brother Wesley and
family in Dividend, Utah was written some weeks
later:~ "Nov. 2, 1942 - Hi kids: No, I haven't
forgotten you although I realize it has been some
time since Ihave written. Iam well and we are
still giving them the old 'Enterprise Hell!' I
haven't been made Chief yet, Wes, but Iam keeping
my hopes up. I may be a hero one of these days
when I don't get too scared, I hope you are all
