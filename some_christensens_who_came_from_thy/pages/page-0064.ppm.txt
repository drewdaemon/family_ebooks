Emigration 52
7. EMIGRATION CAN BE A MAGIC WORD

"The courage and devotion of the Saints who
had their roots.in Denmark, and other of the
Scandinavian countries, and whose lives were
modified by the Gospel, have been seldom equaled.
The posterity of the thousands of these Latter-day
Saints, who left their homes in that bright land for
the sake of the Gospel, should remember them with
fervent gratitude and thanksgiving !'"' (So wrote
Doyle L. Green in 1950, Managing Editor of the.

"Gathering to Zion'' was not stressed among
the Scandinavian members of the Restored Church
until 1852; but when it was, it was found that theâ€™
Danish people were ready and eager. The incessant

last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of
the house of the Lord shall be established in the
top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above
the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many
nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go
up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of
the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways,
and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go
forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem.'"'

The Saints of the mission were counseled by
the Elders to do all in their power to practice
thrift and save to emigrate to the Valley of the
Great Salt Lake. Though some 17 Danish Saints
had emigrated independently in 1850, the first
organized emigration from the Scandinavian
Mission, under Church direction, took place Il
Mar. 1852, when 28 members, mostly Danes,
