the right of freedom of religion, it was not backed
up by the collateral laws nor by the moral force of
the country. Since street meetings were prohibited
by law, and public meetings curtailed or broken up,
the Saints had to hold their gatherings in private
and often in secret. (It was worse in Norway and
Sweden where there were no laws at all aimed at
religious liberty.) Sometimes the meetings were
held in people's barns. Numerous ones were
started when ordinary citizens were asleep, and
not until the call of the nightingale heralded the
coming of dawn did the meetings close. If mission-

to hold meetings in the jails as not, After being
released they would immediately start preaching
again and continue until re-arrested on the same
charges. Sometimes mob action became so violent,
seemingly with police consent, that meetings had
to be discontinued entirely for periods of months;

boys, continued to meet in greater numbers for a
time, but had to be content to spend their fury on
themselves and the rented meetinghouses.

In some parts of the countryside in the
mission, citizens joined in a conspiracy not to sell
anything to Mormons or to hire anyone who was

the Lutheran Clergy advertised the names of new
Mormon converts so that they could be shunned
and hated by their fellowmen, Anti-Mormon pam-
phlets, filled with misrepresentations and false-
hoods, were continually being published and caused
considerable opposition to the work of the Lord in
Denmark, There was much hostility toward the
Saints in most places. But despite the seemingly
untiring efforts of all opposing forces combined,
