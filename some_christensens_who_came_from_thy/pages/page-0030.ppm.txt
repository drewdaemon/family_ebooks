Vikings 18

about where they came from and how. Yet on the
other hand, Danes and their descendants represent
one of the few peoples in Europe that have never

of sails? Cannot we too meditate and dream of
these, since we are of the blood of Vikings? Is

it not necessary to know who one really is?

them, individuals must have always been quite
different, even in Old Denmark. Surely there were
those who led; the in-betweens and on-the-fences;
the aggressive - the rebels - the weak. But whether
richmen, poormen, stone age-men, peasants,
nobles or kings, people as well as nations have had
to learn to get along with each other if they wished
