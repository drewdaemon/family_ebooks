Christian LeRoy 700

general manager, or taking care of his father's
land on The Oasis, not far from Lyman, Wyoming,
It was here on The Oasis that he spent the summer
and fall of 1917, along with his sister Pearl, and
where they became involved in the unforeseen and
heartbreaking circumstances of their beloved
Father's accident and death. Details of this have
been related earlier in this book,

Roy says that following his Father's death
Uncle Lou Christensen bought their property there
on The Oasis and paid for it as soon as he could.
He himself went back to Salt Lake City with his
mother and his younger brothers and sister, He
was then nearing seventeen but too young to serve
in World War I, then in progress, He became his

sister Pearl and her husband Peter Jensen, and
worked in the mines in Eureka, Nevada for six

Farrald says they just couldn't have gotten along
inthe home then without the help Roy gave them,
Roy may still have blamed himself for his father's
untimely death, though circumstances entirely
absolved him, but a less sensitive and less dedicated
soul would have wearied of the long grind and gone
his own way.

Roy married a widow, Luella Ernstsen
Bennett, in Ely, Nevada 23 Dec. 1938, just two
and a half years before his mother's death. He
was within two and a half weeks of his thirty-
eighth birthday at the time and she was within a
week of her twenty-eighth. Luella writes of him: -

January of 1930, being a small town everyone
