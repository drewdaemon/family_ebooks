409 Prophecies Fulfilled

Danish soup and dumplings right off. Father raised
pigs for the market, sometimes fifty or more at a
time, and occasionally when grandpa and grandma
pane to our house grandma would ask if we hada
runty pig', referring of course to a baby pig who
wasn't doing very well. She prefered the ones
with curly tails. Father always seemed to have
a ‘runty pig' when grandma paid us a visit and she
just seemed to have a special talent and pride in
getting runty pigs all plumped up and doing fine in
