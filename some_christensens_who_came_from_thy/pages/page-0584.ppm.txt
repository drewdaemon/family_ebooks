yet he had let himself become involved when an
organization was set up among three major stock-
holders: Andrew (A. B.), his brother-in-law, Otis
L, Ercanbrack, and Albert (A. H.), with a view to
purchasing livestock and real estate on a large
scale from the Starr Land and Development Com-
pany.

With A. B. as president of the new company
and A, H. as secretary, a special meeting of stock-
holders had been held 24 Nov. 1919 in Nephi, where
the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:--
"Resolved to buy said property from the Starr Land
and Development Company, the cost to be paid as
follows: Total price $130, 000 with $35, 000 down
in cash, the assumption of a $20, 000 mortgage to
the State of Utah then carried on the property, the
balance of $75, 000 to be assured by three promis-

another for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1921, another
for $55, 000 due ten years from date of purchase,
with 6% interest overall - and in addition, the crops
raised and harvested upon said land during the year
1920 to be mortgaged as future security for the note
due in 1920, and the 1921 crops mortgaged to secure
the note due in December of that year." So the deal
had been made and became valid and binding upon
all concerned,

This proved to be the most disastrous step
Albert ever took. Being at the height of the post-
war boom of World War I, these stockholders were
not spared when the post-war depression followed
shortly. Albert was forced to mortgage all he
owned to try and keep things going, as well as to
borrow all additional he could, Lastly, he was
forced to turn over his lovely home and most all
else he had to his creditors, and besides was left
under a staggering Ioad of debt which at the time
must have loomed as impossible for him to sur-
mount, .

In August of 1925 Albert and his family
loaded up their remaining belongings and moved
to Provo, Utah. Phillip, almost fourteen at the
time, tells of this move:-- ''Then came the move
from Manti to Provo. It was made with two hay-
racks, Uncle Arthur Christensen driving one and
