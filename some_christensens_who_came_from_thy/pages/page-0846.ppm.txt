Ada Peterson 794

thirteen years of my business. For this ] am
grateful and humble. I always have a prayer in
my heart for strength to meet my Obligations, and
they are many when you care for ten old people on
an average every day three hundred and sixty-five
days a year, Oh my, I could write a book on the
beautiful people I've served through these years,

â€˜In closing I'd like to copy the words on a
thank you note from the daughter of an LDS lady
I once cared for: - 'Dear Sister Johnson, It has
been an inspiring experience to know yOu and |
appreciate all you have done for mother, It is
thrilling to know that the Spirit you Carry is the
One we shall all share in the celestial kingdom and
Our associations will continue there. It was God's
blessing that we were led to you and may we enjoy
always the sweet Spirit that is expressed in your
home. Sincerely, Cecilia Jensen,"
