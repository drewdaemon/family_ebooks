in an All Ruling God and even if it is dark for us
we can sing 'The Lord is with us' and we shall
fear nothing.

Mads Kristjan Hvid - Tingstrup by Thisted,"'

On Tue. 7 May that year of 1889 Christen
and Anne went to Manti on another temple excursion
and this time Else K. went with them, and of course
they took their provisions along and stayed at the
campground near the temple, They were in the
temple for three days, during which time Else
not only assisted the others. with the work for some
of their departed but had the great joy of being bap-
tized and endowed for her own mother, Mette, and
also for Mette's mother, her own Grandmother
Else Andersen (Hvid) for whom she herself had
been named, Perhaps it was then, in the beautiful
Manti temple, realizing again how little knowledge
she really had of her own progenitors, the thought
first came to her that she should return to Denmark
and search out the records of her dead ancestors,
as well as those of her living kin, while she yet had
â€˜her own people in the Old Country. It was a startling
idea to say the least, How could it ever be
accomplished ?

Else had hardly been able to take time off
from her numerous duties that 7th to 9th of May to
go to the temple. Bringing babies alone was a
time-consuming business in itself, considering
the fact that she often was called to assume almost
full responsibility for both mother and babe until
the mother herself was up and around again, That
May was a busy month for Else K., according to
the entries in her medical journal:-- ''Hans C,

' Hansen datter 4 Mai 1889; Lars Olsen son 12 Mai
1889; Westenskow son 14 Mai 1889; Brigham Jones
son 20 Mai 1889; Henry Jensen datter 27 Mai 1889, ''
Indeed she was a very busy midwife and much in
demand, as this journal attested, for she listed in
it 36 babies brought by her in the year 1888 and
another 36 in 1889 - quite.a coincident, but also a
record of one of the many, many labors in which:
she was engaged during those busy years, A good
practice, however, made it possible for her to
begin to save a little of her income for the future,
