and easy to get along with; kind and appreciative
of others and all around good hearted. Alta is
also a fine letter writer. She is rather jovial in
disposition although very, very modest - and
especially shy around strangers. She has a great
love for her brothers and sisters and their families
and stays rather close to those who live near her,
She usually spends Christmas at Tresia's and
arrives there not long after Santa has left, early
Christmas mornings, often waking them up and
bringing bundles of good cheer. Her nieces and
nephews love her. She was especially close to
her sister Lorraine whose recent death was a
great blow to her,
