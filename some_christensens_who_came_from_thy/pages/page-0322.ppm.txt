303 Brown Kit

important work of bringing babies she was sum-
moned, Else K, Christensen was almost always
well prepared, Sometimes she gathered and made
concoctions from smartweed, wormwood, hore-
hound, yarrow and other herbs which grew wild in
the valley. She often used catnip, peppermint and
sage tea in her treatments, She was a specialist
with hot packs and mustard plasters, Among the
medical helps which she used freely and with great
skill were, besides the previously mentioned
"blood-letting knife", a variety of lances for boils
and a suction cup to draw the pus out, She kept

(adopted son of Bishop Christian August Madsen)
and his wife Sarah Olesen Madsen, Else worked
hard to save the life of this little child and as she
worked she prayed, for some malfunctioning of
her heart was evident from the start, With special
care some progress was made in the little one's
condition throughout the weeks following her birth,
but the mother, Sarah, failed to gain back her
health and strength after the ordeal, Else spared
nothing in her efforts to get Sister Madsen back
on her feet again, but to no avail, It was apparent
that the young mother could not get well, In
despair Sarah Madsen called Else Christensen to
her bedside and tearfully pled with her to take her
baby Ada to care for and raise when she was gone,
