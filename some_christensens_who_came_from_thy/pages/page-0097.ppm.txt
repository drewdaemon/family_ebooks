Christmas elves had left it, in place of the rice-
mush. There were always presents for everyone
in Ander's household. When the children were
small there were tops, dolls and little boxes
carved from wood and always a carved figure of
a ''Hvid Knight"' for Mads. Perhaps there was a

dumplings. For the full twelve days of Yuletide,
Danes ate and ate, then it was easy to forget the
wind and cold outside; but the wonderful days of
Christmas one could never forget - Glaedlig Yul!
On Twelfth Night girls in their teens or even older
