of their good land. A start was to be made also
on drying up the bogs all over the country, as
well as the marshlands, and damming up shallow
bays and inlets so that large areas of land could
be reclaimed; this was good, Ja!

The waves of the North Sea itself were
rough and dangerous, There was little peace on
the water there, That very year (1860) during a
fierce storm 14 ships had run aground, all within

louder tones, ''They are in Aalborg now these past
ten years, but only the poor and ignorant peasants
there listen - -.'' And so the talk went on at every
farm in the same guttural voices, words spewed
out in harsh grunt-like sounds, as if the speakers
