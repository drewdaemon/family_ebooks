Early Christian monks were said to have
visited Denmark, but with no success, During the
course of the Viking raids on England, the Danes
were often "exposed" to the influence of Christianity
but it was more or less like "casting pearls before
swine'', It is said some Vikings even permitted
themselves to be ''marked with the sign of the
cross", prior to baptism, when they were in foreign
climes but that when they came back home they
"washed off the baptism" and once more paid their
respects to Odin and Thor. "It was not because
their souls were false but simply because they

therefore it was as well to be on good terms with

Denmark's king, Harold Bluetooth, personally

down his father's old pagan altar at Jelling and
built a church. He tried to convert his people to
Christianity but it was impossible to convert a
whole nation of tradition-bound pagans all at once
and he had little success. Canute the Great became
a devout Christian. His greatest triumph, outside

strolled up the aisle of St. Peters in Rome beside
Conrad (who was that day crowned Emperor), as
his guest of honor and witness",

But the Danes were still heathens, worshiping
their pagan gods, for almost a thousand years after
the first solid Christian churches were established
by the early monks in western Europe. It wasn't
until King Sweyn Estridson took a hand that the
Danes began to be Christians to any great extent,
Under him the Danish Catholic bishoprics became
firmly established, the churches became extra-
ordinarily numerous and the area divided up into
ecclesiastical parishes. Stone church buildings
appeared everywhere (the first ones had been of
wood). These were mostly austere, stern and
simple, like the old Anglo-Saxon ones in England;
but in Funen and Jutland they were ornamented
with a ponderous type of primitive sculpture, among
