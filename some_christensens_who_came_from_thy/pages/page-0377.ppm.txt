And Should We Die 354

Clean sons to give
That others might live,"'

--Grace Noel Corwell

Pearl remembers when Joseph and Roxie
moved into their new home in Gunnison, They had
a big house-warming and the place looked beautiful
for the occasion, especially inside. The parlor
walls were blue and rope had been gilded and tacked
around near the ceiling to form a border, the color
scheme being blue and gold, Joseph was then in
the bishopric in Gunnison Ward and also teaching
school there. Roxie was expecting her fifth baby
and hungry for one, since Harold was almost eight.

October came, and Joseph went to Salt Lake
City to attend General Conference and also to be
present at U. E. A. which was to be held after-

was looking for the new baby any day. Else had
delivered several of her grandchildren before this,

Tue. 7 Oct. 1902, the little girl came, but she
had been too long in the birth and was limp and

her arms and, using all her remedies and skills,
putting her first in warm and then cold baths,
worked against time to save the baby. And as she
worked she prayed aloud the whole time - ''Father
please save the life of this child. . . her two little
sisters and one brother are dead, . , please save
her, . . Roxie and Joseph need this little child. . ,
please let her live!"" For two hours she worked,
