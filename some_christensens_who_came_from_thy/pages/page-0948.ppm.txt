(53) Vera Clark (9) writes, 'I was born 12
July 1918 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, in my grand-
father and grandmother Christensen's home. I
spent most of my first two years onthe ranch
(The Oasis) near Lyman, Wyoming or on The
Weber in northeastern Utah where my father ran
sheep. Then Father went to work for Mother's
brother, Uncle Albert, running his ranch west of
Gunnison, Utah. My sister Alta was born at Aunt
Emma's while we were living at the ranch and my
second sister Tresia was born at the ranch and
Aunt Emma took care of little Alta.

"Ivan Lyon's folks were also farming west
of Gunnison for some Mellors, My folks and the
Lyons visited back and forth and played cards

on occasions, get out the horse and wagon, spend

while we children slept, then drive home next

Lyons would come to our house, People in -Gunni-

from the George Burraston family, who were fine
neighbors and have been good friends ever since.
Dad finally bought a home across from Uncle Alma
and Aunt Elsie Bartholomew, Mother's sister. â€”

"The year I was in the third grade we had so
much sickness - measles, mumps, chickenpox,
pneumonia, and I had scarlet fever, Mother said
the doctor came every day for me and my sister
LaFaye, who had measles and then pneumonia.

He expected me to die and her to get well. Idon't
remember a thing about getting sick or being sick
until I was nearly well - in fact when I started to
