501 Andrew

Lake City played a significant part in the shaping
of our lives, We were in the Farmers Ward and
we soon became active in church there and made
many close friends. It was while located here
that Sheldon and I were called on our missions to
Germany; here that our younger, nature-loving
brother Luther, then fourteen, ran away from
home and was gone nearly two years; here that
Edythe was courted and won by Dr. Burtis F.,
Robbins; and here that Lucile and Margaret met
their future husbands and that Sheldon and I met
and later married our wives.

"When I returned from my mission father
was deeply involved in plans to revive the Dixie
Irrigation Project and to develop some little known
resources in Southern California, His fertile
brain had conceived new possibilities in metals
and alloys so advanced that large corporations,
such as the Ford Motor Co., became interested
and promised large sums of money to develop one
possibility - only to find on closer examination
that this brilliant idea had little substance. During
this time I spent all my time with father. I took
no other job and dropped plans to continue school,
I drove the car on his trips, worked on his projects
and met his business partners, until I finally
realized that he was being used by unscrupulous
men, whose sole object was to keep him sold on
their non-existent skills to the end that he raise
more money to feed and maintain them in the per-
petuation of ahoax, The cost ran into thousands,
Being the oldest living son, Iwas rather involved
in our financial and business affairs and was often
given responsibilities which I was not equipped to
bear. Inthe process, I grew and developed but
father had real need for someone with wisdom and
practical business experience to balance his vision
and enthusiasm. Iwas not up to the job, and among
others with whom he counseled there were few who
had either time or experience to really help."

Luther goes on:-- ''Father spent considerable
time, effort and money helping artists such as
Fairbanks, Campbell and Ramsey; guiding them
into scenic areas he knew so well and purchasing
some of the pictures realized from those trips.
