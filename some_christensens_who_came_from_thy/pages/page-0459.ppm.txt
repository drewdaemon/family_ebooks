431 Wyoming Interlude

and there was charcoal there as if it had been
attached to a stick and it seemed as though there
was a little piece of cotton or woo] about the size
of my fingernail and then ashes ofold rags. It
had burned through the shingles and into the sheet-
ing under the shingles for about 21 ft, wide and

3 or 4 ft. long. After daylight I discovered the
horses tracks and followed them from the house
and along the road clear up to Mr. White's on the
way to Lyman, There sheep had come into the
road and obliterated the tracks. I went at once to
Bishop Rawlins and reported this attempted burn-
ing to him, and the following day I went to Evanston
and talked to County Attorney Mathews. I had
received a threatening letter in July but had told
no one of it up to this time, I then told Bishop
Rawlins about it, I returned home after my trip

to Evanston and watched every night from then on
but saw nothing.

"But on the night of Sept. 20th someone
came again but I did not hear them, though I was
up until about midnight watching, The next morn-
ing my oldest boy went out and there found, on the
South side and about six feet from where the other
fire had been, someone had attempted to again
light a fire. I found tracks of 4 horse that had
been standing outside, This was the same track
as the first one, I followed this track up on the
bench two hundred yards to where I found another
track as though a horse had been standing. There
was evidence of this and where it had turned around
there, One horse was sharp- shod, the Same as the
first track, the other was shod on the front feet
With old shoes. I followed the tracks up to Jenson's
and then a lot of horses had come in and so oblit-
erated the tracks that I lost them. I reported this
to the sheriff by phone and also to Bishop Rawlins.
The sheriff said, 'We will have to do something
about this', but he did not come. Dewey Rawlins
Came out to watch with me and we watched all the
night of the Z2lst, but nothing happened.
