565 Albert

made from her own hair combings, She wore the
highest heels she could buy on her small two-and-
a-half size shoes, which had to be special ordered
through the local merchants, I seldom saw her in
bright colored apparel, for she most always wore
the darker shades of brown, gray, blue, green,
and of course black. Perhaps this is why I remem-
ber so well the dress she wore on that last New
Year's Eve when she attended a dinner dance with
father. It was an evening gown of softest salmon
pink satin with long, fitted skirt and elbow length
sleeves, Over each shoulder ran several narrow
pink satin straps, each centered with a small black
satin button, I stood on a chair beside her with
needle and thread and tacked the straps in place to
please her, Long, black silk gloves completed her
costume, Mother looked so beautiful to me that
night. Seven months from then she was in her
grave,

"Aside from the memory of that wonderful
woman, ''Sherman writes, ''time has left us nothing
more closely touching her character and very being
than the fragments of her soul which she placed
upon paper, In her children's stories she brought
two little mud girls to life, not to mention the
animals and birds and flowers that she translated
into mortality for the delight of young minds, In .
her more serious poems she caught the most pro-
found undertones of humanity and religion for the
delight of the soul. (Included in this category is
''The Wise Man" which won for her first place in
the Deseret News Christmas poetry contest of
1910,) Between the two, in verse and story, she
has woven a golden mesh of love and devotion,
courage and pathos, romance and happiness for
the delight of the heart.'' May we share two of
her lovely poems?

A Toy, A Little Shoe, and Memory

One childish shout brings back the dead days sweet -
A shout now wafted on the summer air

Rolls back the years and brings the days once fair,
And I can hear the patter of his feet,

And I can hear his shrill, commanding calls... ,
There stands my boy in wee blue overalls.
