and all of Else's people back in Denmark, except
perhaps her brother Mads Hvid, of whose death
we have no account, He also outlived all of
Christen and Anne's children, with the exception
of Caroline and ''Chris Krat''. Dear Patient,
sincere, devout and honest Grandfather Laurs.

or credit because of what our grandparents were
or what they wrought. We can only set eternal
goals and try to emulate the greatness of their
characters and their devotion to service, and in
so doing bring lasting honor to their names, How
