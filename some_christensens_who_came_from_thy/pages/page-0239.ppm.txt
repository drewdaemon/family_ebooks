knitting, weaving, spinning, seaming, mixing,
baking, churning - candle making, soap making,
soup making - there was never any end to it,
Undoubtedly they were able to teach the Yankee
settlers some things too; there must have been
quite a transplantation of Scandinavian culture to
Sanpete Valley. Trying to learn the new language
