didn't neglect the girls' musical education either,
for she was determined that they would learn both
to play the piano and sing. I remember so well
going to the red brick house one time to visit,
when the twins were about eight. Millie, as proud
as she could be, had them stand up and sing to-

Millie once told of how sad she was when
their two older boys, Melrose and Wesley, left
