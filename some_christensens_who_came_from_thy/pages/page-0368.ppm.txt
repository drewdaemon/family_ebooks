343 And Should They Die

Else Christensen, and nine foster brothers and
sisters, who mourned her passing in very truth,
for she had left a vacant place among them and a
sweet memory that could never be replaced,
Indeed this gentle little soul had done her best to
shed happiness within the home where she had
been so lovingly welcomed.

Little Ada was buried on the Madsen plot in
the Gunnison Cemetery beside her own mother
Sarah and baby sister Almira, and near the grave
of a little half sister, Ethelind Florence Madsen,
who had died soon after birth six years before.
Ada's tombstone bore this inscription:-- 'In loving
memory of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and
Sarah Madsen - Born Mar. 14, 1888 - Died Jan. 3,
1897 - In sore distress your life has past - You
loved us all while life did last - Reared by Laurs
M. C. and Else K. Christensen."

It is thought that both Laurs and Else were
among those who attended the wonderful celebra-
tion that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the
arrival of the first pioneers to Great Salt Lake
Valley, 24 July 1847. The year 1897 was an
extra special Jubilee Year in Utah. In January
plans had been made by the State Legislature to
"conduct a celebration that would attract national
attention, '' Gunnison Valley residents joined the
crowds, the largest ever seen on Salt Lake City
streets, to witness the spectacular events of the
five day semi-Centennial celebration - the dedica-
tion of the Pioneer Monument surmounted by the
bronze statue of Brigham Young - a reception for
all surviving pioneers - daily parades and speeches -
a carnival and fireworks. On Sunday, 24 July, a
memorial was held in the Tabernacle to honor all
deceased pioneers. Laurs and Else wore their
official 'Pioneer Badges'' to many Pioneer Day
celebrations, These were arnong their cherished
treasures,

But most cherished of all their treasures
were of course their children. It is wonderful to
have parents who uplift and encourage their child-
ren to pursue challenging goals and who support
them when they meet the inevitable frustrations
and reverses of life. Not all were as fortunate
