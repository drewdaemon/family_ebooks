War Whoops 236

Thus, sometime before his death, with a few of
his warriors and a military escort, the notorious
Black Hawk visited every town and village from
Cedar City on the south to Payson on the north,
in an attempt to make peace with the whites and
win their forgiveness. A revealing account has
been given of his visit to Fillmore, in Millard
County, the latter part of April 1870, when he
appeared at a Sunday meeting before a highly
expectant audience;

"With head erect and dignified steps, as
unperturbed as a white General, Black Hawk,
preceeded by the Bishop, marched to the platform
and was seated, After preliminary exercises he
was introduced and the object of his presence

and gesture, the Pah-Ute Chief deliberately arose
and, avoiding the pulpit, stood on the side of the
platform near his interpreter and spoke exclusively
in Pah-Ute, although he could speak English quite

the story of his early grievances:--how the white
invaders had taken possession of the hunting and
fishing grounds of his ancestors; of the insolence
of some of the white men and of the whipping and
occasional killing of some of his warriors, The
speaker seemed to have few regrets for his raids
in Sanpete and Sevier, He denied complicity in
some of the murders of which he had been accused
and expressed sorrow over others, saying that the
raids were forced by the starvation of his people
and that, had he been so inclined, every white man,
woman and child could have been massacred. He
concluded his speech with a not too repentant plea
for forgiveness,

'The Bishop then moved a vote of forgiveness
of their late enemy, who was preparing to meet the
'Great Spirit', and requested that the audience
express their views, On the stand was the father-
in-law of Samuel Brown who, together with Bishop
Josiah Call, had been murdered in the late '50's by
Indians, He broke the suspense by speaking
briefly against the motion, Then suddenly, turning
on the redman, he shouted, 'You black murderer,
you killed Bishop Call, the best friend the Indians
