371 Yesterday's Windows

The folks had a dozen or more copies of the
picture made, one for each family and some extras
to send to their dear relations in Denmark for
Christmas that year, That their Danish kinfolk
received and appreciated the same is indicated in
this translation of two letters received by the folks
later, one from grandmother's sister Stine and one
from Stine's husband, Svend Poulsen:--

"Monday Evening, 27 Jan. 1908
"Dear Sister Else:

"I will tonight try to write a letter to you,
our dear family, thanking you very much for the
picture you sent us. It is really fun to see so
many people on one piece of paper. Yes, all the
little faces, how pretty they are - all of them. It
iS So much fun to see ''Sotter Anders'', as the
children say. Yes him we have seen in person
you know and liked him at once - yes he won all
of us! It would make us happy to see him among
uS again. Maybe some of his sisters and brothers
will come sometime, but I guess you 'Old Ones"
won't come. It is sad that you dear sister should
be so far away from us. Now soon eighteen years
have gone by since you visited us. I am much
better now than when you were here, I thought
just now that if it were now that you had come, I
could really be happy. But thanks because you
made the trip before, it was glorious to see you
then and it was such a strenuous trip, It is good
to know you have been strong and had good health,
this is one of the great blessings in life. Next
Oct. 12th I will turn sixty years old and I guess
you are about two years older, if I remember
right, It isn't much I am getting written for my
husband is sitting here on my right. and is also
busy writing to you. We have sometimes said if
we could just get to know the date of your husband's
birthday then we would surprise him with a greeting.
We hear from him so Often and on the picture he
looks very good. We wish it was clearer of you
but it is not easy to get so Many on such a little
Space, Again thanks for the picture and thanks
because you write to the folks in Thorsted, then
we also hear of you through them. But now when
you get our new address, we hope you will write
