One of the most prominent Middle-Age
Christians in Denmark was Archbishop Absalom,
who served during the Great Period of the Valde-

estate management than religious service, All
churches, both large and small, were lavishly
decorated with expensive murals in glowing colors,
art and woodcarvings, mostly imported, golden
