sort. When older the two youngest Gledhill girls,
Mary and Sylvia, did a lot of singing together and
were considered very good for that time. They
sang ''Alexander's Ragtime Band" and ''Whispering
Hope''in that part of the country for the first time
they were sung there. Millie also did some public
entertaining with them on occasions, At one time
Vena Christensen was ''Goddess of Liberty" at one
of those wonderful small town Fourth of July cele-
brations they used to have down there,

Millie's younger brother Albert (Bert) Gled-
hill, whose mother died when he was in his teens,
writes of 'Grandpa and Grandma! Christensen:--
"T say Grandpa and Grandma because they were to
me just that - and the only ones I ever knew.
Enough could never be said about the good they did.
Anyone who needed could always get a good meal
and bed from them. They helped me in many ways.
May I remind you that Grandma was the only medi-
cal help we had in Gunnison for a long time, and
how well Ido remember that she ran a spoon down
my throat every other day all one winter, Grandpa
and Grandma Christensen gave me, as they did
many others, a home when I had no place else to
go. May God bless the memory of those two
wonderful people is a prayer in my heart - and
right now a tear in my eye.

"During the early days in Gunnison Grandpa
and Grandma kept a boardinghouse and my sister
Millie worked for Grandma, helping with the house-
work and cooking. Of course this brought Arthur
Marinus Christensen and Millie Jane Gledhill
together in courtship.'' Indeed, the two were
courting even while Arthur was attending school
at Brigham Young Academy in Provo, for love
will find a way! A letter written by Arthur to
Millie, who was visiting her aunt in Santaquin,
Utah, near Provo at the time, indicates this fact:--
