love of the countryside was in the blood of both
father and daughter, and as they drove along the
taste of salt was in the air and the smell of it in
their nostrils, They lived only a few meters, or
miles, due west from the seacoast, although they
had to pass over two or three miles of sand dunes
to get there.

The bracing, briny wind streaking across ©
Denmark came from the North Sea. It had sculp-
