261 United Order

That spring some twenty-one families moved
from the northern town of Ephraim and settled on
the new townsite south of Twelve Mile Creek,

This place was at first jokingly called ''New
London" for one of the English-born women in the
group but was actually South Mayfield. The
families here did not belong to the Order, but
living conditions in the two settlements were
much the same. The homes at first were mostly
small log cabins with rough lumber shanties in
the rear, later used for granaries. In addition

to caring for her family and helping with the hard
work of building new settlements from scratch,
each pioneer mother there waged a constant war

South Mayfield grew rapidly and though there was
much competition between the two settlements,
they also cooperated in building mills, roads,

"the Skinnykites". When one left to cross over the
Indian Farm and Twelve Mile Creek from one part
of Mayfield to the other he likely would be heard to

and took his family back to Gunnison, He had put
all he owned into that experiment, which had been
little enough - a few horses, cowS, pigs, chickens,
a wagon and perhaps some small machinery ~- not
many who joined had more to give. But he took
much less than that out, the sum total of nothing
except his family's personal belongings - not even
one cow to furnish milk for his children,

and most likely with sustenance as well, until
Christen could get to producing again. It wasa
blow to the older man's pride to have to depend
entirely on others, even for milk for his family;
