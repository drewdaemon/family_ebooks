853 Luther Bartholomew

"Our three oldest boys graduated from the
University of Southern California - Steven from
Medical School, Kent and Philip from Dental,
Paul is looking forward to being an Orthodontist,
while Allen is delightful, perverse and stubborn,
but looks more like me than any child we have
and is probably made up just like me. We love
them all dearly.

'We are still living in our same little house
in the San Fernando Valley. We appreciated the
comfort and peace we feel in our home. We have
quite a lot of freedom through the day while the
two younger boys are at school, and we take in
many interests, such as: Yachts in the harbor,
new model homes, sport shows, musicals, art
exhibits, etc. Velda and I find that we enjoy the
same things. We are interested in our church
activities and are hoping to buy us a new camper
a year from now and really see the world, I feel:
much as the quotation in Psalms: 'My cup-
runneth over'",

To bring this story up to date, they did buy
the new camper - and guess what? They sold out
in California and bought a new home in Provo,
Utah, moving the first of this year, 1969. They
are now busy furnishing their home, finishing the
basement and landscaping the grounds, Welcome
to Provo dear Cousins!
