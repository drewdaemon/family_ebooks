War Whoops 232

make peace with them on the other. Treaties
were signed with various Indian leaders here and
there, even though they continued to be broken by
the redmen and perhaps some whites, Yet pro-
gress towards peace in the valleys was being made
notwithstanding, One of the most important treaty
meetings for the people of Sanpete, save the one
with Chief Black Hawk the year before, was held
in Strawberry Valley, Uinta Co, in August 1868,
Here Superintendent F. H. Head again met with
Black Hawk, but this time the Chief had a number
of his sub-chiefs with him, They had a "heap big
talk" which lasted nearly all one day. The talk
ended in the signing of a peace treaty by the whites
and Chiefs Augavorum (the White Horse Chief)
Tamarita and Sowahpoint and a few others, urged
on by Black Hawk.

In Sanpete at Ephraim a few days later, nego-
tiations were continued and details of the peace
worked out, In attendance in the town's bowery
were the above named chieftains as well as Black
Hawk, numerous young Indian braves and quite a
group of white settlers, The fact that some of the
redmen came with their faces painted black, war
clubs slung on their wrists and pistols hidden under
their blankets lent a rather eerie effect to the scene.
Apostle Orson Hyde, an emmissary of peace for
the Church, presided and the boastful, insolent
White Horse Chief acted as spokesman for his red
brethren. In eloquent defiance and with much dis-
dain he made his accusations and demands, often
with contemptuous gestures, but the whites refused
to be ruffled. At length their cool diplomacy,
together with Black Hawk's encouragement, over-
came the resistance of the assembled Indians, At
last the party moved to a nearby lawn where the
Indians seated themselves in a circle and passed
around the pipe of peace, Hundreds of dollars
worth of blankets, gay calico, tobacco, trinkets
and other articles were distributed to the eager
Utes as the price of peace, Thus the treaty was
concluded and comparative quiet settled upon the
valley.
