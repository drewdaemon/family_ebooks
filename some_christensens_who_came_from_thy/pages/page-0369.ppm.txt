347 And Should We Die

Death struck often in those early days in
Gunnison â€˜Valley and the Christensens and their
loved ones could not always escape the hand of
the Grim Reaper, Laurs' youngest sister, Sena,
or Nielsene Christiana as she had been christened,
had had some misfortune with her children, having
lost four out of nine sons sent her over a period of
twelve years, three of them one after the other,
She had been wed to Anthony Madsen 18 Oct, 1883
some three months after the death of her sister
Maren Myrup, when she was twenty-one and
Anthony, who also came from Kobberod, Jutland
where she was born, was twenty-three. Sena's
tenth son was born 21 July 1898 but died the same
day before he could be given a name. Sena herself,
youngest child of Christen and the gentle Karen,
followed this last of her little ones in death the
next day, 22 July 1898, which was the fifty-first
birthday of her brother Laurs. She was thirty-six.
Mother and babe were buried in the same casket in
the Gunnison cemetery. Anthony Madsen married
again in less than five months, for he was sorely
in need of a woman's help with the five surviving
sons, the oldest nearing fourteen. He was wed to
a Danish girl, Nielsena Necolena Dortary Nielsen,
or "'Lena'', The ceremony took place in the Manti
Temple 14 Dec, 1898. Onthis same occasion the
necessary work was done for the departed Sena
and she and Anthony, with all their sons both
living and dead, were sealed together as a family
for eternity - and Lena stood for Sena, Lena her-
self gave Anthony two sons and two daughters but
only one of each kind lived to present him with
grandchildren.

There are times of exaggerated sadness
accompanying death, Who can say whose passing
is most mourned, that of a much loved child, a
young so-much-needed mother, or one of the ''Old
Ones''who goes to the grave trailing his accumu-
lated years of struggle, courage and overcoming
behind him? Christen Christensen passed away
Tue. 21 Nov, 1899 in his eighty-third year, going
down like a fine hewn log, an honest man well
seasoned with experience and great faith. He
wasn't sick very long; pneumonia took him, He
seemed to know he was going and 'tis said that in
