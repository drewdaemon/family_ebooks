were already settled there and prospects for them
taking up land in that settlement were said to be
very good, It was virtually believed that Indian
raiding and killing were over, at least while the
winter snow barricaded the canyons, keeping the
redmen out of the valleys. Preparations were
gotten underway in their various households but
there was one thing more that they were awaiting
before they left Manti. This event took place on
the eve of Christmas, 24 Dec, 1869, when Anne
presented Christen with a long-awaited son. It
was quite natural that they should choose the name
of Christen for this new child, in honor of his
father but perhaps also in memory of the other
son Christen who had stayed behind in Old Denmark.

Whether it was the forepart of January 1870,

families went along in the early part of the year
and Laurs and his family came later on in 1870,
Whenever they went that year, however, it was)
likely with a cow tied to each ox-drawn wagon,
and penned up inside somehow some chickens and
perhaps a pig, with a few sheep being driven along -
side. Picture our Danish kinsfolk as they traveled
along thus, varying in ages from 52 year old
Christen and 31 yea old Anne, to two year old
Caroline and a few weeks old Christen. Lars
Myrup was pressing 25 and Maren, expecting
again soon, was almost 21, while small Mary
