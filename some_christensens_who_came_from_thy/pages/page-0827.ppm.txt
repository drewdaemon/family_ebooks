Albert Sherman 778

erroneously fixed for lack of such information dur-
ing the trial. Copies of his preliminary instructions
in an anti-trust suit last year were circulated among
other trial judges by the Tenth Circuit Committee
on Procedure. He lectured on jury instructions as
a member of the faculty of the School for New -
Federal Judges, sessions of which were held in
Denver, San Francisco and Washington D. C, last
year (1968), He also has taken time to speak fre-
quently to groups of young people and last month,

in a series of moot court programs designed by
youth counselors, psychiatrists, social workers

and attorneys to promote improved insight con-
cerning parent-youth conflicts, he appeared as
presiding judge in various Stakes under the auspices
of the Mutual Improvement Association,"

Sherman and Lois, who have resided at 1488
Harvard Ave. since moving to Salt Lake City some
fourteen years ago, recently (Mar. 1969) sold their
home there and moved to lovely ''Bonneville
Towers", 777 East South Temple, where they
occupy Apt. #9A. In summers they hide away
when they can in their rustic chalet ''Krishaven"
in beautiful Provo Canyon, Sherman will be eligible
for retirement in June of 1970 but hasn't yet made
up his mind whether or not he will take that step
then,
