sailed from Liverpool, England in the ship "Italy",
bound for America and 'Zion''. (Ole Ulrick
Christian MÂ¢nster, a former Baptist and one of
the very first LDS converts in Denmark, was in
charge of this group.) In 1855 quite a group of
Saints from Iceland were among those emigrating
to Utah. They settled in Spanish Fork among a
thriving group of Danish Saints there. By the end
of 1857 upwards of 2, 000 Scandinavians, mostly
Danish, had left the mission bound for Zion's
headquarters in America. That fall, all foreign
missionaries of the Church were called home

In Utah a Church Immigration Fund had been

of whom there were many. From then on the
Danish missionaries, as well as those in other
foreign missions, had to sustain themselves,
while funds for the maintenance of branches and
conferences were raised by the free-will offerings
of the local Saints. Thus these members were
tried and tested: but it seemed that the added .
sacrifices and efforts brought manifold blessings
in their wake, A great spirit of brotherhood grew
in that northern mission, It was as if a magic
wand had been waved over the heads of all its
members, with the accompanying command of
"Let there be charity among you!" It is heart-
warming to learn of the love and sacrifices of
these people for each other and the gallant
generosity of the more prosperous in behalf of
the less fortunate of their associates, For
