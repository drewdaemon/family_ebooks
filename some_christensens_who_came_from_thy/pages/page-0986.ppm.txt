this icy treatment and even those who survived
that ordeal never felt quite at ease in our home.
This was a situation I vowed I would ease if I
ever had a home of my own.

''l experienced a rude awakening in my transi-
tion from a 'mighty high school senior’ in a small
town to a lowly freshman at BYU. The summer
after my freshman year Father, Elaine and I
accompanied my future sister-in-law, Gwen, to
New Orleans, where she and Phil were married.
That trip was really alark. Even my knocking 2
cow over on a lonely Louisiana highway didn't
dampen our Spirits much, since poor Bossy was
able to struggle to her feet again and merely gave
us a resentful stare. Elaine's keepsakes to take
back to her children were hilarious, I still
remember her lowering a bottle on a String down
into the Mississippi River for some real muddy
Mississippi water and her chipping off some stone
from a tomb to show and. tell.

“The Pearl Harbor attack the next Deceml
started many decided changes in our lives, Both
Phil and Cullen were frozen to their jobs with the
F.B.1, and the following summer I started working
for the military at Fort Douglas. I loved my new-
found independence. I had never been happier, —
Every day was a new adventure. Sometime: during
that period I received my patriarchal blessing in
which I was counseled.to return to school and
finish my education. So when Father also started
urging my return I agreed to enroll spring quarter,
1943. It was hard to settle down to studying at BYU
again and I missed my friends and activities in Salt
Lake City. In answer to my pleas to return to:the

University of Utah the next fall, Father agreed on
in the office that summer,

condition that I help him
since he had lost his good secretary and was in
desperate need. That was @ bargain !

'tPoor Dad! M stenographic training con-
sisted = die aaamers of shorthand and one Es
typing. But his patience was endless, and working
with him that summer was truly a wonderful exper -
ience. I came to love and enjoy him as a real
friend as well as a father. I began to see what 4

great man he really was. I couldn't believe his
