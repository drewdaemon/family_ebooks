445 Time's Hourglass

rumored that in Europe the ''war to end all wars",
the worst war, the bloodiest war in history, was
almost over, Soon it was all over over there and
the boys were coming home! Cheering, flag
waving crowds, with bands playing, were at
hundreds of railroad stations throughout the

length and breadth of the United States to welcome
