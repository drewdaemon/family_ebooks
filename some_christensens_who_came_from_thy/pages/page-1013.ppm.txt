(66) Kathryn Christensen (4) has written her
own history:- "I was born on August 21, 1929 at
the Crane Maternity Home in Provo, Utah, Mother
had turned forty-four a few weeks earlier and Dad
was fifty-six, My earliest recollections date back
to the old home in Orem, 1158 South State Street,
where I lived until Iwas married at twenty-one.
Earliest memories include glimpses of my grand-
mother Farnsworth's death as a result of having
fallen out of the bedroom back porch, various cat
and dog pets and the bad ends to which each came
in its own time, the thrill of getting an indoor
bathroom, the rhythm of the twin Dexter washing
machine every Monday morning; but, most of all,
the delight I felt when Elaine and Ted, Virginia
and Dan, or Lois and Sherm would bring their
children "'home'' so I could play with them, For
many, many years I think that Donna Southwick,
Colleen Keeler and Kent Christensen were the
most beloved friends that Ihad. During these
early years of memory, houses were few and far
between in Orem, and although mother spent hours
reading to me, sewing for my dolls, playing
dominos etc., it seems that I was always hungry
for child companionship. Phil, Cullen and Norma,
the only ones that ever lived in that home, were
all so much ahead of me, Family reunions at the
canyon where all of us children (my nieces and
nephews) stood Sherm and Phil in various tag
games and where that lucky Colleen always won
the box of miniature chocolates for having the most
freckles, were the highlights of my childhood. The
hours and hours that Kent and I spent digging up
"doodle bugs" and hunting for spiders for our
collection will never be forgotten, The summer
or summers that Dan Keeler Jr. spent with us
