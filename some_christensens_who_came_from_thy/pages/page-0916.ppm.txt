865 Phillip Van Buren

my apprehensions by saying it didn't matter and
that would be wonderful. We decided we would be
married in June as soon as her school was out and
she could come to New Orleans, since I was not
allowed time off."

Phillip was married 19 June 1941 in New
Orleans, Louisiana, to Gwen Johnson (b. 1 Sep.
1918 in Sigurd, Utah to Joseph B. and Mida
Dastrup Johnson), Gwen tells of riding down by
car to New Orleans with her future father-in-law
A. H. Christensen and her future sisters-in-law
Norma Christensen and Elaine C. Southwick, and
what a wonderful time the sixty-nine year old
gentleman showed his three companions. She
Said she almost felt that she had her honeymoon
before her marriage instead of after. The wedding
itself was held in a large southern ancestral man-
Sion owned by a member of the branch of the LDS
church there. A number of the branch members
took over full arrangements for the wedding and
open house which followed, complete with music,
flowers, wedding cake and all, which seemed to
be overseen by framed pictures of ancient ancestors
of the mansion's owners looking down from their
places of honor on the various walls. Norma and
Elaine stood with Gwen in the line and Father
Christensen and Phil's cousin, Marshall Neff,
stood up with him. The Branch president,

Brother Evans, performed the ceremony which
was attended by the FBI special agents in the area
and their wives, together with a number of branch
members, Gwen, who was very near sighted, said
she left her glasses off for the occasion because
Phil didn't like her in them too much and so was
unable to get a good view of everyone or to identify
many of those in attendance afterwards.

Phil continues with the history:~ ''We took up
our residence in an apartment right next to cousin
Marshall and his wife Viola and they were so good
to us. Gwen, bless her heart, was alone a lot of
the time since I was away from home so much. It
was not until she obtained a job with the War
Department, working at the Port of Embarkation,
that some of that lonesomeness vanished.

''My work in New Orleans was fascinating.
