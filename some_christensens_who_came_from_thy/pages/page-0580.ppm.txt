corral were always a milch cow or two, some
chickens, perhaps a few lambs, and father's
thoroughbred horses often lifting their noble heads
high over the big corral gates,

Against the backdrop of Albert and Jennie's
two homes and their numerous activities was staged
the memorable drama ofthe family life that we
their children knew and cherish, The scenes invite
us even now, It was at our first home that I sought
father's sheltering arms in fright at the sight of
my first bewhiskered, bell jangling ''ho-ho-hoing"
Santa Claus, while my younger sister, Elaine,
stood up bravely and gave her order -- ''I want
