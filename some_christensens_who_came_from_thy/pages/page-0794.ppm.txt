{18) Edgar Dee Bartholomew (5) was born
21 Aug. 1903 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. His
mother wrote a history of him and placed it in
her Book of Remembrance from which we quote:--

"Edgar was blessed by his paternal grand-
father, Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Oct. 1903 in
the red stone church in Fayette. His grandmother
Christensen took him to the Manti Temple 5 Sep.
1911 where he was baptized a member of the LDS
church by Quincy G. Crawford and confirmed the
same day and place by Nils O. Anderson Jr. He
was ordained a Deacon in Gunnison, Utah 7 Nov.
1915 by Adolph Peterson.

"Edgar's family moved from Fayette to
Gunnison the spring of 1907, when he was nearly
four. His father bought a fine red brick house
there from Lafe Bown, Edgar started grade
school in Gunnison, beginning in the fall of 1909
when he was six and continuing each school year
until the spring of 1916 when he was going on thir-
teen, The red brick house was sold to his Uncle .
Arthur Christensen and he and his mother and
brothers and sisters moved into Uncle Arthur's
old house in southwest Gunnison, once owned by
Uncle Chris. This was in the late fall of 1915.

"On 27 Mar. 1916 Edgar, together with his
mother and brothers and sisters and also his
Uncle Louis Christensen's family left Gunnison
by train for Lyman, Wyoming, from where they
moved onto a homestead about six miles east of
Lyman, which had been taken up by their mother.
Here the family lived and worked in summers and
moved to Lyman in winters where the children
could attend school. Edgar must have finished
grade school there. Â©
