in every way to my other - a miracle!

"During these last years I have served in the
church as a Seminary teacher six years, as Semin-
ary Stake Coordinator three years, the last year
supervising the Seminaries of both San Mateo and
San Francisco Stakes. Iam also serving as a
member of the San Mateo High Council, and as
such acting as advisor to the 458th Quorum of
Seventies, the Stake Mission and Educational
advisor. We have seen the church in this area
grow and prosper. When our Stake was first
divided from San Francisco in 1945, there were
only some 2200 members living in the area from
South San Francisco to Monterey which was then
a Mission. The only chapels were in Paio Alto
and San Jose and they were small and inadequate.
At this date, 1967, there are five Stakes with
about 30, 000 members and beautiful chapels dot
the whole area. We were privileged to attend the
dedication of the beautiful Oakland Temple and hear
the Prophet David O, McKay set it apart as a house
of the Lord for the performance of the sacred and
eternal ordinances,

"We have been wonderfully blessed as a
family. Our children are all successfully and
happily married, Ann and I are rather enjoying
the quiet of the home with all of them gone but we
can hardly wait for each opportunity to visit their
families and hope that the coming years will bring
a great increase in our posterity. We have been
blessed with wonderful health and in times of trial
and stress we have been strengthened and comforted,
We are both deeply grateful for our wonderful
parents, brothers and sisters, and all the far-
flung branches of our families, and for the love
that binds us together.

"Our testimonies have been strengthened with
the years as we have seen the guiding hand of the
Lord in all that we have done. Time and space will
not allow me to relate a hundredth part of the bless-
ings which He has poured forth upon us and our
families, We can only express our gratitude and
bear witness that He lives, that He hears and
answers prayers, that He is merciful, kind and
forgiving. We pray that we may serve Him all
