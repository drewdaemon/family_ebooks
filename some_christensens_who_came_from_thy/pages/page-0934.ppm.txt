885 Lucile Christensen

our youngest daughter, Susan, was born, Mother
Christensen came to care for us, for after Susan's
birth I was laid low with a severe case of mental,
physical and spiritual depression which put me
back in the hospital and then kept me low after

my release, Faith, administrations, and the con-
certed prayers of the Council of the Twelve, under
Grandfather Richard's guidance, combined to help
me. At the time I prayed fervently to the Lord,
saying that if he would help restore me to my feet
so that I might care for my children and take my
responsibilities, I would serve him willingly for
the rest of my life. It was a total commitment
which He honored. My recovery was rapid, and
since that time I have had many opportunities to
work in His church, This experience led to greater
solidarity and purpose in our lives, The old chapel
where we met in Dayton was sold by the church
since the neighborhood was rapidly deteriorating
and we were meeting at the Miami Hotel. George
was Sunday School Superintendent and I was Relief
Society President, Later I became District Relief
Society President and Branch Primary President
at the same time. A new chapel was built and
George supervised its erection while I planned its
interior decoration, It was completed during 1950-
1952, We were busy and happy, but as Kathryn
approached her teens we became aware that there
were only a few young people in the church there
and began to think seriously of moving to Utah
where the children would have more opportunity

to associate with young people of their own faith,

"1952-1958 - Salt Lake Years: In July 1952
we bought Alumatic Door and Window Co, in Salt
Lake City from George's brother, Ralph, and
found ourselves deeply engrossed in a new challenge.
The next three years brought steady growth but also
excessive business demands, We began to feel that
we were neglecting our children, With the hope of
lessening the strain we brought others into the com-
pany and changed it from a partnership into a cor-
poration - but this didn't work out, After taking
some heavy losses we pulled out and formed the
George F, Tate & Co. (our present business),

This made it possible for Ralph to assume control
of the old business which he had originally started,
