417 Prophecies Fulfilled

gotten as much as I have had I not been keeping a
journal while she was at our home, Although at
the time, by years she numbered thirty to my
fourteen, we shared secrets, activities and heart
pangs. Besides providing me and my friends with
home-made bread spread with thick cream and
sugar for an after school snack, she also provided
a sounding board for and a sympathetic understand-
ing of my restless teen-age fancies, as evidenced
by an entry in my journal, dated 14 June 1917:--

had been in curls since Saturday and Aunt Vena
told me that it really looked awful, We fixed and
fixed but it still looked like a rat's nest and it was

we didn't go, She told me that she would help me
plan the party that we were going to have in a few
days. . . June 16, 1917 (Day of the party) We've
