Phillip Van Buren 866

1941, we agents were asked to round up the enemy
aliens who had been located and kept catalogued
through painstaking investigations done previously.

mouth, looking for Japanese fishermen supposed
to be in the area who were suspected of providing

might be entering the country illegally by way of
the Mississippi. We picked up a German alien
who was alleged to have made Some statements
against President Roosevelt, He had a large knife
in his possession when we captured him, but of
