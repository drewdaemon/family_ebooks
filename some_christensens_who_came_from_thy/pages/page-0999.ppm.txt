(63) George Fern Clark (9) was born 21 Nov.
1924 in Goshen, Utah, Utah, the first son in the
family after four daughters, When he was nearly
five and a half his father bought a lot in Santaquin
and moved the family there, It was here that he
attended grade school and Junior High. He then
went to Payson to High School but only went a year
and a half, quitting about a half year before gradua-
tion in order to work, since he felt in great need of
money for the extra things boys need and desire,
there being â€˜very little for those things at home..

George joined the Civilian Conservation

Corps (CCC) which was activated during the
depression years, During the two years he was
thus employed he worked at seven different camps
in Utah, including the Cedar Breaks and Zion Park
areas, Then he got a job as a night porter in
Walgren Drug in Sait Lake City and then with the
Bamberger Railroad helping to remove ties from
Center Street in Provo, The urges of youth to see
more of the world began working on him at this
point, as they did upon one of his boy friends, and
the two of them took off for Nevada to find work
and ended up in Red House, where they worked in
a smelter until they had enough money to go on in
the Model A Ford they were driving. The two went
then to Reno, Nevada for a little lark and here they
"went broke''! and had to work a month and a half to
make enough money to go on to California.
