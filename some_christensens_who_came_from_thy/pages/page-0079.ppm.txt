over - yes, these I must include in this history,
but where and how? Yet I cannot keep my thoughts
from returning to the area of Jutland, Denmark and
the Danish peasants who lived and loved and walked
the earth there so many years ago, And I knowl
must go back there, as imagination dictates, and
follow this newly born baby girl and her associates
throughout the remainder of her life and tell her
story as I see it; for she is my Danish grandmother
and very precious to me indeed!

That they should name this second daughter
of theirs for Mette's mother, Else, was natural
since their first girl had been named for Anders'
mother, Karen, who lived there with them. Anders
may have thought that she should have the name of
his only living sister, Inger Cathrine, also, since
Danes often gave their children a whole string of
names, Mette probably objected to Inger but con-
sented to add the Cathrine - so Else Cathrine was
the name agreed upon. The Lutheran or State
Church to which they belonged prescribed that a
first sprinkling could be done in the home as soon
after a birth as possible lest the child ''die
uncleansed and be damned forever'', This home
baptism could be done by any male if the Priest
were not on hand, such as the landlord, gardner,
etc,, or even by the father himself, Then as soon
thereafter as could be arranged, weather per-
mitting, the family needs must travel to the Parish
church to register the birth and ''Hjemmendobt"'
(home baptism) of the infant, show it off as evidence
to the congregation, have the whole affair officially
recorded by the Priest and likely pay him a goodly
fee in the bargain for his trouble in taking care of
the 'Fremstillingen i Kirken" (official recognition
in the church).

Baby Else's home baptism was taken care of
the very day after her birth but it was not until 14
Mar. 1847 that the members of her family, attired
in their best, drove with her in the wagon a mile-
and-a-bit down the country road to the Parish
church in the neighboring village of Hvidbjerg and
had her naming and sprinkling duly acclaimed and
recorded by the Lutheran Priest there, A copy of
her 'Fg√©dsels - og dabrattest'' (birth and baptism)
