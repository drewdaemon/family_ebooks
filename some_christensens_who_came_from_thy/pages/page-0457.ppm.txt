Wyoming Interlude 432

the potato patch between us and the house, I sent
Dewey down along the south side of the potato patch
and I went north along the canal. A man ran out of
the northwest corner of the potato patch and I shot
at him in the dark as he was running. I shot at him
a second time as he was near the bank of the canal
and I think I hit him, because I heard the bullet
strike something. We searched along the canal
that night but found no one and it began to rain very

had waited only two months to make the attempted
burning. In the newspaper published at Lyman,
the first article in relation to the burning was
under the date of Sept, 25th, mentioning the
attempted fires on the nights of 14th, 20th and 22nd
of September and stating that the County Attorney
and the sheriff were in Lyman on the case by the
25th. The Bridger Valley Enterprise also printed
an account of the threatened burnings, But every-
one in the region was talking about it and rumors
flew thick and fast, Suspects were found on every

A certain Mr. So-and-so was said to have made the
