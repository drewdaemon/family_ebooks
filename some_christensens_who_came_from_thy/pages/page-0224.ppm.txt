those who laid down their lives on the way will

have an opportunity to give an accurate and truthful
account of their sufferings."

of these poor emigrants would not be inclined to
abandon them when they joined the body of the
Saints in their "Promised Land",

Much heartened and their loads lightened, the
remaining emigrants continued

their travels along
the Mormon Trail.

Severe snowstorms during some of the rest of the
journey, the mortality among them would likely
have been much higher had they not received this
aid from Captain Hinkle y's relief train, At South
