George Thomas Clark, husband of Elvena
Christensen, was born 6 June 1887 in Upton,
Summit, Utah. His parents were early Mormon
pioneers of Upton, from England, William Rolland
and Amelia Frances Smith Clark. He spent his
early boyhood in Upton and attended the public
schools that were available there. But it was
necessary for him. to work hard, for Upton was
a frontier town and the people were mostly poor
and had to struggle for a living.

Upton, first called ''Up From Town" because
of the altitude and distance from Coalville, which
was settled first, is still fourteen miles from
The elevation is still the same, about
7, 000 ft.; the winters are still long; only the name
has been shortened. Starvation, cold and disease
stared grimly at the first settlers there 105 years
ago. Deep snows softened the stark brush and
rock covered slopes but made foraging difficult
for farm and wild game animals. Clearing acreage
for planting had been difficult and the pioneers had
realized only a little barley, oats and a few potatoes
from a summer of hard labor. A few rabbits and
an occasional elk supplemented their meager diet,
and one family was forced to empty the straw from
their beds to keep the family cow alive through the
long dreary months.

Coalville was first settled in 1859 by a few
settlers who were attracted by the. good farmland
at the confluence of Chalk Creek and the Weber
River. That same year coal was discovered along
Chalk Creek and more families flocked to this high
country. Isaac Burton and John Stanley followed
Chalk Creek still higher into the mountains and
cleared some land and built a pole fence around it.

In 1861 Joseph Huff came, saw the land and
exchanged a cow for it. That summer he harvested

a crop of wild hay and built a cabin. In early 1863
others began trickling in and soon more than 40
families called Upton home.

Slowly they cleared the land and brought

Coalville.
