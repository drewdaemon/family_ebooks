265 United Order

the increasing complexity of community life,
which produced friction. By the time of Brigham
Young's death, 29 Aug. 1877, the majority of the
Stakes and settlements had given up the United
Order, including North Mayfield, but the Stakes
and Wards of the church continued to grow and
flourish and railroad, college and temple building
went on.

Laurs and Else Christensen and their family
were among those who went over to the other side.
By some means, Laurs procured a lot on the south
Side of Mayfield, or in New London as it was then
called. The property was located some east and
South of the public square there. Whether he
home steaded it, or purchased it from the govern-
ment, we are unable to say. Nevertheless he
became the first recorded private owner of that
lot, for we saw an abstract of the deed. Though
it was not recorded as belonging to him until Jan,
5th 1880 (when it was all paid for or other terms
of the contract with the government had been fully
complied with) we know he moved onto the property
at least two-and-a-half years before that.

A three-room adobe house, facing west, was
soon built on the premises and before Sunday, 8
July 1877, the Christensen family had moved in.
On that particular day Else gave birth to a fine
black-haired baby girl. They selected the name
Emma Eliza for this little one but it wasn't until
4 Oct. 1877 that they took her to the church there
and had her blessed. Bishop Ole C, Olsen of
Mayfield Ward blessed and named her. On that
particular day also, the baptisms of Christen and
Andrew were taken care of by the Bishop's coun-
Selor, Henry Jensen. Christen had just passed
his tenth birthday (Oct. 4) and Andrew was four
months past eight. The baptisms were undoubtedly
held in the waters of Twelve Mile Creek and it is
a good guess that their mother Else was not present,

Laurs also secured a small farm in the fields
near town, His credit in the Order likely supplied
him with little more than a wagon and team of oxen,
a milch cow or two, perhaps ahorse, along witha
few tools and possibly a plough; his stewardship of
Cabin and lot, etc., having gone with the Order.
