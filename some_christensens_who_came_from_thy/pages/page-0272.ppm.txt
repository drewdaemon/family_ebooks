United Order 254

of excellence, from which they made their wigwams
and clothing, Arapeen was as devoted to his people
as Chief Walker had been to his and had their wel-
fare at heart; thus often bitterly resenting the
encroachment of the whites on the streams and
lands of their fathers,

On the other hand, Arapeen was sometimes
very friendly and looked to the whites for help and
welcomed their assistance. We find him in such
a mood soon after he took over Walker's chiefship.
In May, 1855, he appeared at Manti and said he
believed there was room for all people in the area,
both Indians and whites, Feeling that he was the
rightful owner, as Chief of the Utes, of all the
land of the region, he deeded Sanpete County and
its water, timber and other assets, to Brigham
Young as trustee-in-trust for the Mormon Church,
-- ',,.for and in consideration of the good will I

deed, signed by Arapeen (Siegnerouch) with an 'X"',
and witnessed by George Snow (a son of Gen, Snow),

who came there to settle, They gave him two fat
oxen for the spring and some calves for the meadow,
or so we are told,

In a warm-hearted effort to cement peace
with the red brethren, Brigham Young, as Superin-
tendent of Indian Affairs as well as President in
Utah, set aside various parcels of lands as 'Indian
Reservations", where they could hunt and fish and
also cultivate and improve farming land to provide
them a better living. One of the most prosperous
of these reservations was a twelve mile square
area established around and including the well
watered and timbered Arapeen Valley. A number
of young men from Manti, including Moroni Voor-
hees, a brother-in-law of Gen, Snow, were sent
to live with the Indians on Twelve Mile. Here
they learned the Indian language, helped build
