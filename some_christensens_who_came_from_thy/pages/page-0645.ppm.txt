Charles Peter Peterson, husband of Emma
Eliza Christensen, was born in Brunflo, Sweden,
10 June 1878, a son of Marten Gronvell Peterson
and Barbru (Barbara) Pahlson Peterson,

Charles left Sweden for the United States
2 Aug. 1879, when he was about fourteen months
old, in company with his parents, Marten and
Barbara Peterson, two half brothers, John and
Peter (sons of his father by a former marriage),
a Sister Marta and a brother Paules; Charles of
course being the youngest. They settled in Gunni-
Son, Sanpete, Utah among other Scandinavians,
Some of whom they may have known. They were
not members of the L.D.S, Church but came’ to
Zion to better their living conditions.

Charles' father was a shoemaker by trade

and the 1880 census taken in Gunnison the summer
of that year bears this out. It lists the family as’
follows: 'Marten Peterson, age 45, male, married,
Occupation shoemaker, born in Sweden; Barbara
Peterson, age 33, female, married, keeping: house,
born in Sweden; Peter, age 18, male, Single, son
of Marten, works on farm, born in Sweden; John,
age 16, male, single, son of Marten, apprentice
(likely to his father) born in Sweden; Marta age 6,
female, single, daughter of Marten, born in
Sweden; Paulus age 4, male, single, son of Marten,
born in Sweden; Charles Peter age 2, male, single,
Son of Marten, born in Sweden."

Five other sons were born to this Peterson
family after they moved to Gunnison, They were
a thrifty, energetic group. The oldest son, Peter,
became a shoemaker, like his father; two of the
other boys became farmers, and the rest were
businessmen of some sort. John at one time was
Mayor of Gunnison.
