his turn with her children watching by her bed of
suffering but she soon died and he returned to live
at his ranch home,

He was a fine gentleman and very good to
everyone, especially Emma's sister Vena and her
large family. How often I remember Charles and
Byron driving up in his large truck to a Christensen
family reunion, with a number of George's and
Vena's children aboard. They would come from
Gunnison around by way of Goshen or Santaquin to

his life since he had become active in the church
was like ''Heaven on earth,"

When Byron married in 1936 and brought his
wife Mildred home to the ranch house to live,
Charles stayed on as a most welcome part of the
family. Though he had his own room upstairs and
