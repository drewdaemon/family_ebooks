answers - if she ever did. Meanwhile she went
courageously on with her work of raising her
family, including the sickly little Ada, ushering
new babies into the world and succoring the dis-
tressed. But her mind was often turned to her
kindred,

the following communication from Denmark (as

Yes, dear sister, Ihave given you the names and
birthdates of all of our children which are the best
we own. We and you of course have the same
number, They are all well and so I can do nothing
else but marvel at seeing them. Iwas with Mads
and Stine and we decided that I should write alone
this time so that the letter wouldn't be too fat. I
am to greet you from them and say from Mads
that he will do what he can to accomplish what you
require from him. They will each write in a few
days.

"Sister Marie is moving to Thisted and she
will have a good amount of work. Stine lives in
Thisted. Her husband is named Svend Poulsen,
He is a carpenter and they have six healthy,
delightful children and two dead, Mads also has
six but they have had ten, He lives in Tingstrup,
Thisted Parish, and they have two good dwellings.
In the summer they live in Thisted.

"Our father died 10 May 1878. When mother
was dead he sold the house but kept that little room
in Norhaa, but he spent a lot of his time here with
us, The last time he left here he wasn't very well.
He lay in his bed most of a month after. Mikkel
