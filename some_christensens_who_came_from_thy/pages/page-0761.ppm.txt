the direction of the guest conductor Noble Cain,
nationally known composer and musician.

Ours was rather an odd looking chorus made
up of both young singers and some who were older.
There were two old maid school teachers from
Nebraska who were Methodists, a tall thin one and
a short plump one, and a very young new convert
straight from England among the fourteen singers
we had mustered. This young convert said to me
once, walking home from practice, ''Can one be
baptized over again? You know there is hardly
anything I haven't tried!" Our accompanist was
the wife of the Principal of Latuda Junior High
and she was a good one. Our winning number was
"OQ Divine Redeemer", All my efforts, prayers
and spent time were more than rewarded when
Brother Robinson of the M. I, A. General Board
stood up in the Tabernacle at one of the general
conference meetings to evaluate the M, I. A. arts
program and said, among other things, "Out of
the smoke, dust, grime and desolation of a coal
camp has come one of the most divine ladies
choruses I have ever heard!' I knew he meant
our chorus and my eyes filled with tears as I
trembled with emotion.

It was while living in Latuda that I first be-
came seriously interested in genealogy, encouraged
by my husband's lovely parents, Joseph B. and
Martha Alice Fairbanks Keeler, who were both
experienced genealogists. I began to search the
records for my progenitors, going occasionally to
the Genealogical Library in Salt Lake City, thena
rather humble institution in comparison with todays
world-famous organization. Dan and I both served
on the Branch and then the Stake genealogical com-
mittees. Then he was called to serve as a coun-
selor in the Branch presidency and later as
Standardville Branch President, serving as such
for a number of years.

I taught vocal music in the Latuda Junior
High School one year and was "'drafted'' to teach
the same at Carbon High School and Carbon Junior
College in Price the spring quarter of 1942, when
their music instructor, Ferris Edgley, was drafted
into the service. I rode back and forth on the school
