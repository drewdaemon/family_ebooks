A Lovely Land Z

totally surrounded by sea, except where Jutland's
broad neck joins Germany, and broken apart by
numerous water courses the three largest being

the "Sound", ''Great Belt" and "Little Belt''. As

if these weren't enough, the surface is so studded
with lakes, coves, bays, canals and fjords that one
wonders how any land has been able to survive at
all amidst all that water! But the pleasant land ig
there nevertheless, holding up its proud head above
the ever-lapping of the hungry sea.

Denmark, primarily a farming kingdom,
devotes 75% of the land to agriculture and 9% to
forestry, while 8% is occupied by moors and dunes,
with most of the remainder being built up into vill_
ages and cities, large cities being comparatively
few innumber. There is no mineral wealth but the
soil is fertile and, as reported in 1950, produces
three times as much grain per acre as is grown in
the U. S. A. The climate is a study in extremes,
with the long snows of its dark winters and the
"shimmering half-light-at-midnight" of its short
but bright summers. There is always wind, parti-
cularly in northwestern Jutland, fierce off the cruel
North Sea in winters, caressing in summers--but
wind enough to turn a mill or lift a sail any day.
But it is not the formation nor the performance of
the land that beckons and invites one to these far-
away shores. The great charm of the "Little
Kingdom of Denmark'' lies in the people who possess
her: their character, their customs, the manner in
which they have dressed the land; and also--and
perhaps to an even greater extent--to the colorful

history of her past, reminders of which can be seen
all around the land today.

The Danish people, Subjects of a constitutional
monarchy since 1849, are at present about 4, 500, 000
in number. In the neighborhood of 26% of these live
by agriculture, 32% by industry, and a good part of
the remainder by fishing, shipping, handicrafts and
tourist service (this latter growing each year). This
was not so in earlier Denmark, when most everyone
lived by farming and fishing and a few by trade.

Even the richest nobles maintained close contact
with the soil, as well as with shipping. The country
is far more commercialized today, although
