Westward 182

Meanwhile, the Christensen family was in
real trouble, the gentle Karen being very sick,
Frail and ailing at the beginning of the voyage,
and carrying her eleventh child, the heavy lurch-
ing and pitching of the ship, as each new storm
was encountered, upset her more and more until
she was forced to take to her bed and stay there.

It was no ordinary seasickness that she had,

in the Vendsyssel Conference and had been baptised
into the Church in Feb, 1861. Like Else, she was
emigrating without her own family members and
gladly took over the care of Pouline, now eleven,
Petrine, age seven, and little Sena (Nielsine) who
had her fourth birthday enroute, 15 June, which
must have passed by mostly unnoticed because of
the deep concern of al) for her mother's welfare.

It was about this time

that the weather changed abruptly and became cold
and stormy so that the Kenilworth was forced to
slow down and made poor Progress, Then all
