water rights for part of it, part being in alfalfa
and part dry farm. About 1913 Chris, as before
mentioned, had bought this 160 acres from the
company as an investment, Later, with his encour-
agement, some of his brothers and sisters had
taken up the adjoining homestead land together
with a certain amount of range land that went with
these homesteads, until by the middle of 1917 most
of the ground still available in this area had been
taken up by members of the Christensen family.

On this jointly owned land, The Oasis, Chris, his
daughter and his brothers and sisters envisioned

a large and prosperous estate some day.

In the meantime, war clouds had gathered
over Europe and by 1914 the major countries there
were involved in a bloody struggle, It had been
hoped that the United States could be kept free of
this conflict but by April 1917 she had been swept
into it. Soon two million American men were
fighting with their allies in Europe and an equal
number were training in this country preparatory
to going over there. Thus with the coming ofa
bright new century with its new inventions, enter-
prises, and miracles, came the shadow of this
new century war - 'a war to end all wars'' it was

children were living in their three-room house
there, improving their property and harvesting
their crops, Elsie and her five children were
living in their two-room house not far away,
cleaning up their land and getting ready to harvest
their potatoes, Elmer and LeRoy, or ''Roy''as we
shall henceforth call him, usually took turns with
the herds or farming on their father's and sister
Pearl's places each summer, This summer Roy
was on The Oasis with Pearl, helping to harvest
the hay and grain they had raised, Elvena (now
Mrs, George T, Clark) was living alone in her
two-room log cabin, her husband being away with
the sheep most of the time, All seemed peaceful
and serene there that lovely autumn, but clouds
of trouble were gathering on the horizon for them
