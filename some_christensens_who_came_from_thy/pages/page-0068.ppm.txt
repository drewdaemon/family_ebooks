Emigration 56

neighbors, former friends, and sometimes even
one's very own flesh and blood as well? And this,
merely because one desired to worship as he chose.
So emigrate one must, if only to assuage one's
pride; but mostly to find peace and security for
oneself and family among people of good will. Even
