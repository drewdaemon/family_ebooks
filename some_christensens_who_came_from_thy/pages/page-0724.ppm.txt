PART SIX

THEIR NUMEROUS GRANDCHILDREN
AND THEIR DESCENDANTS

"We have come by way of the trials and
errors, the anxieties, hopes, pathos, and
strivings of others - We have been given so
much for which we have paid so little."

--Richard L, Evans

Laurs M. C. and Else K, Christensen had
sixty-seven grandchildren, A history of each is
included in this part of the book, Fifty-one of
them were living when the writing of it was begun;
four have passed away since, In order to save
space and repetition each grandchild's name in
the beginning will be followed by a number denoting
the branch of the family to which he or she belongs;
viz: Christian's (1), Andrew's (2), Joseph's (3),
etc. Each is listed chronologically, according to
the year of birth. Granddaughters appear under
their maiden names, and in all instances the .
original Danish spelling of the surname Christen-
sen has been used, although a number may now
‘spell the name Christenson. It is too confusing
to do otherwise, —

How fortunate we are to be able to present
some of the experiences of these people as told by
themselves; for most of those living sent in their
own histories which ranged in length from very-
short to far-too-lengthy to be published in full here.
We are most grateful for each and everyone, how-
ever, and delighted to find that our Christensen
cousins have about run the gamut of interests and
accomplishments in this great panorama of modern
American living.
