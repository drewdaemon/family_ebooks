Cullen Yates 924

for Judge of the Fourth Judicial District - but he
was defeated. Among a few of the credentials
listed on his campaign literature were these: -
"Current President of Utah State Bar Association;
Utah County Bar Association (past president);
American Bar Association; American College of
Probate Counsel (Utah State Chairman); Provo
Rotary Club (past president); Past President Provo
Jaycees; Provo Chamber of Commerce (Past
Director); Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks,
Provo; Utah Valley Opera Association (Past
Director); Past President of Riverside Country
Club; Member of LDS Church.

Fundamentally, the processes of the law
mean a great deal to Cullen and he came by this
naturally, since it was sorta "born and bred in
him!'' as it were. I remember hearing of the time
when he was taking his first turns at driving the
family car. He was driving Father home from
Salt Lake City late one night. They were alone
and Father was in the back seat, presumably
asleep. Cullen began speeding and the siren of an
alert highway patrolman made him well aware of
it. He pulled off the highway and slowed to a stop
and the patrolman was soon que Stioning him rather
bruskly. Cullen squirmed under his gaze and
glanced hopefully in Father's direction but the
older man never moved or spoke, Cullen was on
his Own with his accuser and Father allowed him
to suffer the full impact of breaking the law.

Yes, Cullen learned first hand to respect the
law by counsel and example, for his father believed
in and lived it to the fullest. Cullen writes of him
in this regard:- "While my association with Dad
at the office was not nearly long enough, I know
he was a great lawyer. Older members of the
Bar still comment on his integrity and hard work.
The law was really his life, Perhaps so much so
that in his declining years he was unable to find
real interest in anything else, Near the end, I can
still see him sitting at his desk, moving papers

around, and acting like an old war horse who would
like to do battle just one more time. "!
