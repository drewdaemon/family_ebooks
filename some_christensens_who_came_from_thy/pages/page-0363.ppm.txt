With Flags Flying 338

temple, Wed, 26 June 1901. As their children
came along there were many "double cousins"!
among the Christensen and Bartholomew des-
cendants, It has been said that Sister Christensen
and Sister Bartholomew got their heads together
and tried to make a fourth match between their two
families but Elvena Christensen and Henry Barth-
olomew didn't see things their way.

The oldest son Christian was the second of
Laurs' and Else's children to marry and it was to
his childhood sweetheart, Caroline Larsen, that
he was wed. It had always been felt that Chris
would marry the daughter of their old Christenburg
friends and neighbors, Ole H, and Inger Larsen.
They chose to marry at Gunnison during the Christ-
mas holidays, Dec. 29 that winter of 1893, Her
parents gave the couple a fine wedding party that
Friday at 4 o'clock in their nice winter home in
Gunnison, and we can be sure the Christensens
were all invited. "The lovely bride wore a beauti-
ful dress of robin-egg blue satin with orange
blossoms in her long, blond hair." The newlyweds
rented their first home but began building their
own house right away. This was less than a block
east and across the road south from the home into
which Chris had moved with his parents as a small
boy, when the Christensens had first come to
Gunnison twenty-three years before; for hewas
now twenty~six while Caroline was twenty-two-
and~-a-half. In two years the white rock house was

finished and the two moved in, along with their
year old daughter Pearl.

As each of the Christensen children were
married they could at least expect one of Else's
homemade quilts and a pair of her down-filled
pillows, Else always kept geese and with the
coming of each spring the ritual of plucking their
down came too, Though not as hard as shearing
sheep, nevertheless this job took a lot of pluck,
with the frightened geese honking and almost
screaming in pain - though 'tis said it didn't hurt
them overly much. Winters found Else stuffing
pillows or carding the wool she had sheared from
their few sheep in spring and making it into batts
to line the quilt tops she had pieced from scraps,
