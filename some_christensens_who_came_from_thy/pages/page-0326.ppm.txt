dying mother? Not Else!

Sarah Madsen passed away Friday 25 May
1888, less than two months before her twenty -

in the Gunnison cemetery beside another baby
daughter, Almira, who had died at two years,

people who raise her, - Victor A, Madsen." So

they changed the small girl's name to Ada: Chris-

Saints in Sanpete Valley, had awaited with great

hill of solid stone jutting. west into the valley from
the rugged Wasatch Mountains east of the city of
Manti, the magnificent structure had grown until
now it stood in all its glory on the crest of "Temple
Hill", its delicate towers patterned against the sky.
It appeared like a glittering jewel on the bosom of
the mountain range, Built of oolitic stone of a
warm cream or ivory color, which had been
quarried from these same mountains, it commanded
