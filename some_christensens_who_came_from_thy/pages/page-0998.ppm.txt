949 Mabel Norma

Explorer leader inthe M.I, A. In August of 1964,
after having been in exploring nearly one year, my
wife and I were able to purchase the home at #3
Douglas St. in which we hope to spend the rest of
our lives, Knowing this to be a permanent move
we, with the concurrence of our bishop, decided

to change our membership to the North 33rd Ward,
the ward where we now reside. My wife and child-
ren changed immediately, but I could not bring my-
self to leave 'my boys' until another year had
passed, In late 1965 I took over the explorer post

principle of divine revelation and inspiration, and

never face a congregation but what Iam over-
whelmed at the tremendous leadership abilities of
the men over whom I serve. May the Lord bless
me and help me to bring about those purposes for
which I was called.'' .
