And Should We Die 348

his last hour he insisted on Anne straightening and
smoothing down his clothing all around him, wish-
ing to be as immaculate in death as he had always
tried to be in life, If, as some Danes believed,
there was a gathering of all one's dead ancestors
over the earth at an Old One's passing, then there

her six children, three of Karen's children includ-
ing the eldest son Christen in Denmark, numerous
grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Andrew, son of Laurs
