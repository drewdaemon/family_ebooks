I see her basking in the joy she finds in our
lovely home - in the big dining room with brown
embossed leatherette fabric on the wainscotings,
papered scenes of forests in colors of green, brown

the lyrical rippling of waters, the consonant music
of nature, or the dissonant music of life.'' In fact,
Jennie loved life. Though she was very human her
spirit seemed to soar above the clouds of ordinary
