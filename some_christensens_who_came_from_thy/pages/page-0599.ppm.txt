a thousand times or more in years gone by.

â€˜All his later life father dreamed of going
to Denmark, In fact he at one time even began
making serious preparations for suchatrip, He
had instilled in us children a pride in our Danish
heritage, It may be that I was the first of his
descendants to see that beautiful country in his
Stead (1959), How proud he would have been to
See that Lovely Land. How proud I was when I
Saw it. And how proud I am of him."

first wife of Albert 'H" was born 28 Jan. 1878 in
Manti, Sanpete, Utah. She was the fourth child
and second daughter of nine children born to Joseph
Smith Snow and Lucy Ellen Van Buren, early Mor-
mon Pioneers of English and Dutch descent.

A history of her life is included in the volume,
"Cheney Garrett Van Buren and His Family',, pub-
lished by this writer in 1962. Others have written
about Jennie S. Christensen and all are agreed that
She was an unusual and outstanding individual.
Albert, writing of his first meeting with her,
States:-- "There seemed no doubt in my mind
from that first evening but that she would fit
completely into my hopes and life. She had taught
School, attended the University of Utah, was very
intelligent and possessed a grace that greatly
appealed to me. Our visits became regular and
increasingly agreeable to both of us and it was not
long before we became mutually convinced that life
together was promising and inevitable. "'

Elaine describes her thus;-- ''She was small
of Stature, but she walked like a queen; her eyes
Were large, blue and misty, but searching and
appreciative; her hair was dark and rich, curling
the way nature wanted it to; her mouth was sweet
and provocative, but spoke wisdom and truth; her
hands were small and square, but tender and
Creative, !!
