325 A Clear Call

Sustaining the government and taking no part in
the political agitations of the day, This went a
long way in finally convincing the authorities that
banishment of the Elders was not in keeping with
the general spirit of freedom of which the Danes
were intensely proud. And so it stood in Denmark
when the group of travelers from Salt Lake City,
including Else K, Christensen, reached Copen-

time to dwell on prospective answers she might
give to her Danish kinfolk when they asked about
Mormon polygamy? She knew well that her rela-
tives would be "up on things'! She would have to
face the issue as squarely as possible. We wonder
how long it was before she learned that four days
before her company had landed in Copenhagen, on
24 Sept. 1890, President Wilford Woodruff, under
divine inspiration, had issued his famous '"mani-_
festo", advising the Saints "to refrain from
