poultry, fruit and garden products were hauled to
the mines in Utah and Nevada; anything that would
sell, in fact, was taken there to sell, often for
gold. Many farmers made trips after their crops
had been harvested or at other times when the
farm work could be managed by the women and
children, Taking care of their animals, preparing
food and entertaining each with tales of Indians and
the olden days around the campfire, relieved the
monotony of these long hard trips.

Laurs and Else's eleventh and last child was
born in the new rock house in northwest Gunnison
at nine o'clock on a Sunday night, 27 March 1887.
She was blessed in the home 7 April and given the
name Elevena, after the Danish way of naming;

day, 29 July that year of 1887, all of his living
descendants got together and held a celebration

what he did. He had a lively disposition and was
a good mixer, He loved to dance and did very well
at it. But most of all he was a fine storyteller,
and folks always gathered round to hear the tales
he told, especially the young people. He was an
excellent letter writer and a fine penman besides,
