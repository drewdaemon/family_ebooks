961 LaMar C, Clark

that day by the side of her parents in the cemetery
at Goshen, Utah county, Utah.

In speaking of her, her sister Tresia adds:-
"Lorraine was one of the best housewives I have
ever known. Her house was always clean, nice
meals cooked. She always kept Kathy clean and
looking like a doll. She loved working in her yard.
Truly she excelled in most of her undertakings.
Her husband said of her after they were divorced,
'In the sixteen or seventeen years we lived together
before our trouble began, as a wife and mother I
could find no fault in her. I could paint any room
in the house, move anything out - stove, refriger-
ator - without cleaning first. Everything was clean. !"

Daughter of Lorraine Clark and Forest Abel
Craig (divorced):

(A) Kathryn Anne Craig, born 21 Apr. 1950 in
Salt Lake City, Utah

(65) LaMar Christensen Clark (9) Cousin
LaMar called on me at my home in Provo Satur-
day 20 Mar. 1967 and gave the following short
account of himself:- '"I was born in Goshen, Utah
County, Utah 14 Oct. 1928. I started school in
Santaquin, first in elementary and then graduated
from Jr. High there. I attended Payson High parts
of three years but did not graduate, staying out of
school at times when work was available, I got
odd jobs with farmers, in the onion and potato
harvests, etc., and herding cows."

His sister Tresia tells of one incident in his
life:- "It was difficult for our father to keep our
big family in shoes. Clothes could be made over
or handed down - but shoes wore out. One time
when LaMar was about twelve years old he was
herding cows down by the canal and kicking his
feet out over the stream as he sat resting on the
bank. One of his oxfords came off and fell] into
the stream and he was unable to recover it. These
were his only shoes. He was frightened and didn't
dare tell Father, but confided in me. He sluffed
school for a number of days and went barefoot
over to Salem and worked in the potato and onion
