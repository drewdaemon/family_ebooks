387 Destiny Takes a Hand
"Dear Sister:

"As Iam staying with sister Marie at pre-
sent, Iwill send you our greetings too as I don't
think we will get to send a letter this time. At
this time of year Svend is quite busy and he is
taking a trip ina few days. But Icantell you
that we are fine and really happy at the thoughts
of seeing you dear ones, especially from so far
away. Yes, if you just do come to Denmark once
more! Loving greetings, your sister, Anne
Kir stine (Stine)!"!

"Dear friends in the distance:

To you dear sister, first we shall say thanks
for your long letter. It is delightful hearing from
you but when we have the wonderful joy of seeing
you then will it be much more delightful. I can
tell you that we are all well and have it good,
Mikkel is still running the farm but it probably
will be only one more year. He'll shortly be an
old man for in September he will be seventy-five.
But he is well and he gets around, away and at
home, and that do we all. So we have so much to
thank the good God Father for - yes his grace for
us is more than we can comprehend. I know to
begin with that I won't write as long a letter as
you, dear sister, Brother Mads' wife is very
sick and has been that way for a long time so we
don't know if she is going to be here very long,
But it all stands in God Father's hands, and since
theyzely on this it shouldn't be as hard on us
friends as long as what happens is God's will.

We have sent your letter back to Marie so don't
have your new address but hope your old one will
find you. Iam supposed to say â€˜hello' from Svend
and Stine, we are happy that they came to Thorsted.
I will close with many loving greetings to you all.
Mikkel and Karen Skaarup, "'
