(42) Henry Marvin Christensen (3) was born
in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah T Oct. I911 in the
family home in the southwest part of town, which
house is still standing (1969).

When he was about ten years old his family
moved to a farm on the "Rocky Point’ a mile or so
west of town, because of financial reverses, Here
his father fed livestock and Marvin was expected
to help where he could. He attended public school
in Gunnison, which was a good walk from the farm.
When he was going on fifteen his father passed away
(1926) and a little over a year later his mother, two
brothers, Virgil and Don and himself moved to
Fayette, Utah, about six miles north of Gunnison
to live with his mother's brother, Uncle Henry
Bartholomew, who was a widower with small sons
of his own, This move ended Marvin's formal
schooling,

Like his brothers, Marvin loved to hunt and
fish and many trips to mountains, meadows and

streams were enjoyed by them for these purposes,
The Christensen boys were welcomed by the young
people of the small village of Fayette and they had
lots of good times. Marvin began keeping company
with a local girl, Elva Eliza Olsen (born 23 Oct,
1912 in Fayette to Joseph and Dora Mellor Olsen),
The two were married in the Manti Temple 1 July
1931, when Elva was going on nineteen and Marvin
was not yet twenty.

The couple procured a farm west of Fayette
where Marvin farmed but they lived in Fayette,
And though Marvin was brought up as a farmer,
he had a liking and talent for building also, He
built the home they lived in - tore down an old
rock church storehouse and used that rock for the
walls, He and Elva had five children, two dying
soon after their births, But shortly after fourteen
years of marriage the couple were divorced, 17
Aug. 1945. The three surviving children, ages
thirteen to seven, went with Elva, who stayed in
the area, She also received the home and farm.
Later she remarried and moved to Salina, Utah.

Marvin left Fayette and moved north to the
area of Lehi, Utah, where he operated a’ church
farm for a few years. During these past years he
has had a truck service and done some building of
homes, etc. It is said he built the home in Lehi
where he and his second wife now live. He ©
remarried 26 Feb. 1946 in Elko, Nevada a young
divorcee, Mrs. Lois Marie Ferguson Winterton
(born 21 Apr. 1922 in Sandy, Utah to Stanley W.
and Dorothy Larson Ferguson), Lois had two
young sons, ages seven and almost five. Marvin
raised these boys until they married and left the
home, but he never adopted them, He and Lois
have four children of their own, three sons and
one daughter, 7 Gf

Marvin, like the other sons of Joseph and
Roxie Christensen, is a big fellow, He has gone
into building almost wholly now as an occupation -
houses, garages, fireplaces - and what have you.
The four children are still at home and all teenagers
together and all in school, Being father of nine
children and stepfather of two others, has kept him
busy over the years, There have been thorns and

thistles along the way but also plenty of sunshine
and roses. And though his formal schooling stopped
when he moved from Gunnison some forty-two years
ago, his education in the "University of Hard
Knocks" has continued and will continue to go on to
the end, as it will for us all. For life itselfis a
schooling and we are all pupils and, whether we

wish to admit it or not, we are all looking towards
our own day of graduation.
