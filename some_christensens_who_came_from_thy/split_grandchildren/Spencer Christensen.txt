(32) Spencer Christensen (7) was born in
Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 31 Mar. 1908. His sister
LaFaun writes: 'Spencer died 6 May 1908 in
Gunnison, I remember being with him at the time.
He took convulsions, He was buried in the Gunni-
son Cemetery. I used to ride my horse to the
cemetery nearly every day during nice weather to
put flowers on his little grave. I remember his
funeral, which was held in our Christensen grand-
parents' big rock house which later became our
home,"
