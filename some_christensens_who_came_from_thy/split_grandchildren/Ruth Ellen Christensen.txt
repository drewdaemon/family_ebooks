(15) Ruth Ellen Christensen (3) was born in
Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 7 Oct. 1902. She was
delivered by her grandmother Else K. Christensen.
The account of her birth has been given in some
detail in an earlier part of this book, She was
baptized 11 Oct, 1910 inthe Manti Temple. She
grew up in a family of boys for her two only sisters
died soon after their births. To these five fine
brothers, towering above her, she has always been
a most loving and helpful sister. They always
speak of her with great affection and love to visit
at her home,

Ruth herself has written a brief history of
her married years, from which we quote:-- ''I
married Niels Franklin Hansen (born 28 Nov, 1899
in Centerfield, Sanpete, Utah to Hans Christian
and Anna Margaret Nielson Hansen) in Richfield,
Utah 30 June 1921. We have had a wonderful
marriage, (Cousin Byron Peterson says that
Ruth and Frank lived in his parents' home for a
short time when they were first married.) Our
first child, Franklin Duane, was born in the home

of Annie Gledhill, sister of the other Bishop
Joseph Christensen. When Ellen Maxine, our
second child, was six weeks old we rented and
moved into the home I had grown up in. She
caught cold and it developed into bronchial asthma,
We have raised her on prayer since then but she
still isn't well.

"After four children the doctor said I wasn't
able to have any more. On Dec. 7, 1937 I had
triple surgery in Salt Lake City and a little over
one year and three months after that our lovely
daughter, LaDon was born, On 25 Oct, 19481
had triple surgery again and on 9 Mar. 1966 I had
another major operation - so now I should be in
fine shape,

"We lived in Sterling, Utah for awhile and
while there I taught sewing in the three older pri-
mary grades in the local school for two years, to
prepare them for High School in Manti, the first
year without pay. Itaught sewing two years here
in San Diego one day a week, under the direction
of the Adult Education program, and turned my
check over to the Ward Bishop for our building
fund project. I did alterations in a dress-making
shop here for several years, long enough to-earn:
‘Social Security.

"T have taught in M.I.A. and Relief Society
(Theology) and been a Relief Society Work Coun-
selor. My latest service was eighteen months as
a Sunday School teacher while Frank was in the
Sunday School Superintendency. Our son Duane ©
has worked with the Scouts for years. His wife,
Jean, is now Primary president, after having
served eight years as Sunday School Coordinator,
Our daughter Maxine's health does not permit
much activity but her children are all active in
the church, Garth Joseph in 1950 was all-star
softball pitcher for the church and brought the
trophy back to our then-new Ward. Since then he
has been Y,M.M.1.A. president, Branch presi-
dent, a Stake High Councilman, ona Stake mission
and inthe Stake Mission presidency and had many
other responsibilities in the church. He is now
bishop of his Ward in Escondido, Calif. His wife
Joan used to teach Seminary, then served on the

Relief Society Stake Board. Norma was the queen
of the first Gold and Green ball in our new Ward,
LaDon is teaching in Sunday School and has a troop
of Cub Scouts; she used to teach in Primary.

"T feel that perhaps one of my greatest
achievements is my long list of friends and the
many children besides our own grandchildren who
call Frank and me 'Grandpa' and 'Grandma', I
was written up one year in Neal Morgan's news-
paper column as having received one hundred
birthday cards that year. In 1967 we received
two hundred and two Christmas cards, plus other
greetings - so much love!" On the back of many
of the friendly letters that Ruth sends out isa
little sticker bearing the following message:--
"Dear Letter; go upon your way, over mountain,
plain or sea, God bless all who speed your flight
to where I wish you to be, And bless all those
beneath the roof where I would bid you rest, But
bless much more the one to whom this letter is
addressed.'' This message is so typical of the
love and goodwill Ruth bears her relatives and
friends and people everywhere,

Ruth and Frank make occasional trips back
to Utah, especially at deer season when Frank
goes to hunt, Their last trip to date was to attend
Ruth's brother Harold's funeral, Frank recently
retired and Ruth writes of this:-- 'Frank has just
retired after twenty-three years as a civilian
employee of the U. S. Navy, teaching the appren-
tices in electronics, He said he didn't realize how
important he had been until he was through and
they said so many nice things about him, ‘It was
just like attending my own funeral' he said. He
had his picture taken with the 'Captain of the
Island' and other naval dignitaries,'' During this
time they have lived in San Diego. Perhaps now
they will find time for more trips to visit relatives
and friends,
