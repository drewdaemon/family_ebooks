(21) Myrtle Ivy Christensen (1) was born 10
Nov. 1904 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the house
built for the family about 1895/96 in the southwest
part of town and which is still standing (1969).

When Ivy was five and a half an epidemic of

the dreaded disease scarlet fever hit the small town
and her family was among the victims; a red flag

of quarantine hung on their gatepost. Her father
was away on ''The Weber" with the sheep at the
time and before he could return her sister Orilla,
not quite two years older than herself, died of the
disease, 22 May 1910. Her father returned to com-
fort the distressed family and just in time to bid her
thirteen year old sister, Elora, goodby, for she
succumbed five days after Orilla. Joint funeral
services were held for these two beautiful sisters
on the lawn in front of their home and they were
buried side by side in the Gunnison Cemetery. Ivy
and the four other children were spared, including
the eight months old baby Farrald, yet the home
was never quite the same again.

July of that year 1910 Ivy's family moved to

a comfortable home with a spacious yard in Salt
Lake City which her father had purchased from his
brother Andrew and which was reported to have
been built for early church President John Taylor.
(Details of this home, written by Andrew's daugh-
ter Edythe, are included in an earlier chapter.)
Ivy has written a little about her life from here on
and from this we quote:

"I remember Grandfather and Grandmother |
Christensen very well. They used to come and stay
at our house almost every year after we moved to
Salt Lake, to attend General Conference, One
_ thing I especially recall is that after they had gone
_ to bed each night, since Pearl's and my bedroom
adjoined theirs, they would talk to us what seemed
like hours about,politics, _

"I started school at the Roosevelt School,
9 East and 33 South, and went to eighth grade in
the Hawthorn School on 17 South 7 Bat. I attended
High School at Granite High, 33 South 5 East. I was
active in sports of all kinds, especially outdoor
sports. I enjoyed dramatics in High School, which
took us out of town and to different schools and
churches to put on small plays.

ny took piano lessons for two years from
Marion Cannon. I was organist in the Primary and
Sunday School in Wandemere Ward. I played for

MIA dances for about a year, Ihave also done a
lot of lovely handwork over the years. In summers
we lived at the ranch in Wyoming or over in the
summer home in Weber Canyon, which ranch we
called 'The Weber'",

These lovely summers on the ranches in
Wyoming and Utah came to an end for Ivy and
others.of their family, with the exception of Pearl,
when their father met with his death on the ranch
in Wyoming, 5 Oct. 1917, from an accident a few
days earlier. When word of their father's accident
reached Salt Lake City, Ivy's mother left Ivy, then
lacking a month of being thirteen, in charge of her
two younger brothers, eight and five-and-a-half,
while she rushed to the side of her dying husband.
A kind neighbor kept an eye on them the several |
days their mother was gone. This was indeed a
time of heartbreak for the bereft family.

Ivy continues: "I was married when nineteen
years of age, 29 Oct. 1923, in Salt Lake City to
Melvin Glen Campbell (born 3 Oct. 1904 in Salt
Lake City to Robertson Sim and Agnes Hind Napier
Campbell), I have worked most of my married life
so have had little time for other things outside of
that and raising a nice family, two girls and one
boy. A third girl and our last child died the day
of birth, unnamed, I worked for Auerbach's and
the Paris. Department Stores for two years and
then, during World War Il, I worked at the Rem-
ington Arms Plant for a year... Since then I have
worked at Snelgrove's Ice Cream Store for some
twenty-three years and am still employed the re
at the present time. ,

"My husband has been » employed by’ the City
here in Salt Lake most of our married life except
for one year (abt. 1932) when we lived’in Los °
Angeles, California; up until the time he suffered
his. heart attack and stroke 9 Nov, 1966. The road
. to recovery has been a slow old road to follow. He
has made more than one-trip to the hospital since
then. He isn't working but has really been blessed
since he got out of the hospital the last time. He
gets really tired of doing nothing. With spring
coming, however, I'm sure he can keep busy and
will feel even better. It isn't good to be idle and

that is why Iam going to go on working as long
as I can.

"We went through the temple in Salt Lake
11 Sep. 1968 and were married for eternity, after
having taken the Project Temple course, We are
so happy about this. We only wish that our child-
ren were sealed to us, but perhaps someday they
too will see the importance of it and prepare them-
selves for this great blessing. At least we have
now made a start in the right direction and set the
example for them."
