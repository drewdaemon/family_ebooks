still standing today. He was christened Ellis
Myron but later changed his name to the above
arrangement, His only brother then living, Harold,
was ten years older than he, so his closest com-
panion in the home was his sister Ruth Ellen, some
three-and-a-half years older; they have been great
friends ever since.

When he was in his teens his parents moved
from the home of his birth to a farm they owned
near Rocky Point, west of Gunnison, where he
helped his father feed lambs and with the farm
work, He attended grade and high school in
Gunnison, graduating from the latter. It was a
long walk from Rocky Point to school and seemed
especially so in the cold of the winter. But in spite
of it, or perhaps a little because of it, Myron grew
to be a tall, strong, healthy youth capable of a lot
of hard work. He received excellent training in
farm and livestock management from his father and
set his heart on acquiring a good farm of his own
someday.

His father died in the small farm house near
Rocky Point, 23 July 1926, when Myron was four
months past twenty, leaving him as his mother's
main source of help and strength. Harold and Ruth
had long since married and made their own homes.
His three younger brothers, one nineteen and the
others going on fifteen and ten, were a lot of help,
especially the two oldest who had undergone a lot
of farm training and were also big fellows and
capable,

Myron at the time was courting, One even-
ing at a roller skating rink in Manti, Utah (Felts
Pavillion), about four years before he had met a
Manti girl named Delida Jensen (b, 23 June 1907
in Sterling, Utah to William and Maria Louella
Peterson Jensen), A friendship had begun that
night which had lasted those several years, during
which time Myron had made hundreds of trips to
Manti in all kinds of weather. Nearly nine months
after his father's death, Myron and Delida ("Dee")
contracted a civil marriage in Manti, 13 Apr. 1927.
Myron's mother and three brothers soon moved to
Fayett, Utah to live with her recently widowed
brother, Uncle Henry Bartholomew, and assist in

caring for his motherless children.

Dee takes up the story from here:-- ''Myron
and I took up farming in Clarion, Utah (near Gunni-
son) and farmed there until Delta City took the
water rights away. After leaving Clarion we moved
to Gunnison for awhile and then we got the oppor-
tunity to come to Genola, Utah to work for G. H.
Chaffin on his ranch, This was during the severe
depression of the 30's. Myron worked on the
Chaffin ranch for ten years and then bought a farm
of his own in the Genola area where our family still
lives. We have five living children and one died at
birth, The five are all married now and have child-
ren of their own, so Myron and I live on the farm
alone and still work hard. But we travel quite a
lot in our car and always go on at least one big
trip each year, most usually in late fall or winter
when the farm work can be left alone for awhile.
We have been to the Northwest, Mexico, and num-
erous times to California where we almost always
drop in on Ruth Ellen and her family in San Diego.
This winter we took Myron's brother Marvin and
his wife Lois with us to Ruth Ellen's, We enjoyed
ourselves there. The last trip his brother Harold
took before he died was with us to San Diego. We
love to travel. We go fishing a lot too, for Myron
loves to fish.

"The winter of 1967 was a hectic one for us.
My mother passed away and Myron was laid up with
the gout in his foot, This was pretty tough for a
farmer. Then our son's year old boy was in the
hospital with spinal meningitis and was very sick,
though he finally responded to the medication.
Grandma Dee had the four year old to care for
during his baby brother's illness. Generally we
have good health and should not complain, but we
too are getting old like the rest of you. But we
enjoy life a lot.

"While in Goshen, Myron has been a member
and one time president of the White Lake Riding
Club. He was also employed by the Strawberry
Highline Canal Co. here for eleven years, At
present, besides operating his own farm, he is
employed on the large church farm at Elberta,
Utah, not far from our place, and has been for

several years, Looking forward to retirement,
Myron just sold part of his farm and bought himself
a boat so he can go fishing in style, "'
