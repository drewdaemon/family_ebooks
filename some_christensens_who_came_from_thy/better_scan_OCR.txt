ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I desire to record my appreciation to a few
of the numbers of people on whom I have depended
for information and inspiration in the writing of
this book, without whose assistance it might never
have been accomplished. MANY THANKS... .
First of all to my patient husband, Daniel M., for
time and quiet in which to write, and any and all
else I desired of him; to my children and brothers
and sisters for their confidence in me; to my many
wonderful Christensen cousins who have so willingly
helped; to a nephew, Bryce Christensen, for trans-
lations, etc.; to a native Dane, Gunnar Christensen,
for advice on Denmark; to a friend, Evelyn Lord,
for typing and forebearance; to certain individuals
who have written about Denmark, particularly the
Danish author Palle Lauring for his "A History of
the Kingdom of Denmark", as well as former
Church Historian, Andrew Jensen, for his "History
of the Scandinavian Mission", from each of which
Ihave gleaned much information and quoted freely;
and last but not least, thanks to Ib Permin of Andr.
Fred, Host & Son of Copenhagen, Denmark for
permission to use excerpts from the English trans-
lation of Mr. Lauring's book, published by that
company.

PREFACE

The record of forty years has been inscribed
on the Scroll of Time since I first became interested
in the history of our Christensen family. As I look
back now it seems to be inevitable that I should
write this history. I was driven to it by urgings
beyond my own. Several experiences, three of
which I relate here, have highlighted my interest
and spurred me on.

Shortly after the death of Grandfather Laurs
Christensen, his and Else K. Christensen's joint
Temple Record Book came unexpectedly into my
keeping. From time to time I thumbed through
its well recorded pages noting the lists of dates, :
names and places, Vital statistics about unfamiliar
people can seem dead and uninteresting; yet, to me,
each browse through the record spiced my enthu-
siasm. I experienced a growing awareness that I
was somehow deeply involved in those strange
Danish names and places. Being a frequent pro- .
crastinator, however, I put the book aside during
lengthy intervais. But that tenacious feeling of
involvement and responsibility persisted.

Another experience affected me profoundly.
I described it in an entry in my journal dated July
7, 1933: ''Today has been a glorious day for me!
At 9:00 a.m. Ientered the LDS Church Historian's
office in Salt Lake City in hopes of contacting
Assistant Church Historian, Andrew Jenson. [I
had been told he had been a passenger on the same
ship that carried my Christensen grandparents and
great-grandparents from Denmark to America in
1866. Upon learning of my mission, Brother
Jenson, then in his 82nd year, greeted me cordially
and said that he remembered my Danish ancestors
well. (He had been fifteen years old when he and
they had come. to America together.) He had kept
a day-by-day account of the voyage and had recently
translated it from Danish to English. Although he
was very busy on this day, Brother Jenson turned

Vv
<span id="page-??"></span>
the translation over to me and, seating me at his
desk, allowed me to make a copy of that portion of
his diary pertaining to the voyage. He said that I
would be the first to do so, Brother Jenson pro-
duced large maps of Denmark and pointed out
places of interest to me. I thanked him and began
to copy.

Feverishly I wrote, Boundaries between the
past and present seemed to disappear, Day by day,
across the great Atlantic. JITexperienced with my
precious forebearers all the newness, excitement,
anxieties and sorrows of that difficult and memor-
able journey. This was one of the most thrilling
genealogical experiences I had encountered. Only
those who have known the exhiliration of discovery
can appreciate my feelings at being thus ''caught
up". Iwas astonished when they announced it was
4:30 p.m. and closing time.

Again, in the spring of 1958, a little over a
year after father's death (Albert H, Christensen),
the telephone rang. Aunt Myrtle, my dear ''second
mother'' was on the line, She had been cleaning out
the basement of the old home in Orem preparatory
to offering the house for sale, Midst the clutter
and trash, the coal dust and spider webs, she had
found an old dilapidated brown satchel. Apparently,
upon Grandfather Laurs Christensen's death, some
30 years before, the satchel had been entrusted to
father's care, but very soon found its way into
basement storage and was forgotten, Its contents
were musty and dirty. Aunt Myrtle picked up the
bag gingerly, took it out into the backyard intending
to consign it to the flames of a bonfire already con-
suming other discarded rubbish. But something
stayed her hand, She put the satchel on the back
porch. The next morning she made a cursory
examination of its contents but found nothing of
interest to her. At that point she was prompted
to,call me and ask if I wanted the dirty old thing.
Did I!

Recessed in its cracked, musty interior were
' small journals, old letters in a foreign language,
and precious documents of the past, glimpses into

vi
<span id="page-??"></span>
the lives and activities of loved ones long departed,
Preserved by the kind hand of Providence.

Several weeks later, when eighty-seven year
old Aunt Elsie Bartholomew came to visit, I placed
the satchel on the rug in front of her without a word
of explanation. 'Why my goodness, ' she exclaimed
excitedly, "that's mother's old kit! I haven't seen
it for sixty years. That's the kit mother used to
keep her medical instruments in. It sat by her
bedroom door day and night for years and years,
always packed and ready at a moment's notice =
whenever a call came for her to go tend the sick
or dying, or to bring another baby into the world, !!

When I received the "kit" it contained no
medical instruments, but things far more precious
tome. Apparently, after Grandmother's doctoring
days were over, the ''kit'' had become the depository
for her treasures. There were old Danish letters,
some over seventy years old, from Grandmother's
three sisters, one brother, and others of her rela-
tives in Denmark. ge ES

I want it thoroughly understood that the second
part of this book is the story of Grandmother Else's
childhood and youth, of which we have known so
little; for while she could have told it herself we
were not listening, I have taken the liberty to put
it into dramatic form, interweaving fact with
fiction - binding fiction together with many facts,
The Danish letters helped so much with this, I
feel that Grandmother Else. K, was a great char-
acter and we will probably.remember her best if
we bring her to life during this period of her
existence, To my knowledge I have not altered
the truth in any degree. The historical back-
ground can be well documented, The characters
are real, If [have offended any I hope to have
the opportunity to apologize,

_ I cannot claim that there are no errors in
this book, The writing itself has taken me over
two-and-a-half years, Some writers have been
censured for overlooking unconsciously or inten-
tionally the darker dissonances of their subjects.
Ihave tried to present both sides,

Vii
<span id="page-??"></span>
Those of us who are living today are witness-
ing the birth of anewera. A far different era than
the one our parents and grandparents knew. The
era into which we were born is about to pass away.
I recall the words of the educator, Max Rafferty:
"Today the hammer of accelerating time is beating
on the great anvil of the world with ever increasing
brashness and insistency. Sparks are flying from
the whole surface. The point of no return is past."

We are indeed approaching a very new and
different world - a challenging world - a wonderful
world - a frightening world; and in this new world
the Christensens who are left have a great heritage
as well as a significant responsibility. As Ihave
assembled material for this book my appreciation
and love for my cousins, relatives and Christensen
progenitors has increased an hundred fold, if I
were to dedicate this book, however, it would be
to my children and grandchildren with deepest
affection, Iam proud and grateful to have been
able to contribute a few measures of understanding
to the lives of those who are to follow. We must
all go forward with firm resolve, devotion and
courage to make this a better world.

Little Denmark like a small neck and head

<span id="page-??"></span>
PART ONE
DENMARK--NOW AND LONG AGO

"Let me rejoice that Danish blood
Within my veins doth flow"

--Ancient Holstein Bard

1, THERE IS A LOVELY LAND

The title for this chapter, about the birth-
land of our cherished progenitors, was borrowed
from the pen of Adam Ochlenachlager, Denmark's
National Poet, who wrote one of this country's
national anthems and called it by that name.

DENMARK--A sea-washed kingdom of some 500
green islands (483 to be exact) 100 of them inhabited
the others not; and thrown in for good measure, a
ragged-coasted head-and-neck of land jutting north-
ward from Germany, called the Jutlandic Peninsula,
or ''Jutland", (It was in Denmark's Jutland, the
most northwestern part sometimes called Thyland
or 'Thy'', that our Danish Christensens were born.)
Denmark, the smallest of the Scandinavian countries
and Europe's smallest kingdom, is often called .
"Little Denmark". Her total land area is 16, 576
square miles--about twice the size of our State of
Massachusetts. There is nothing particularly
spectacular about the land itself except for some
dazzlingly white chalk cliffs, the so-green of its
ever-green islands, and the unusual sculpturing of
its varying coastline, 4,620 miles in length. The
terrain is mostly gently rolling with some woods
and hilly areas, particularly in Jutland, where the
highest point, ''Heaven Mountain", reaches upward
about 600 feet; which may seem insignificant to
"Rocky Mountain folks" but is undoubtedly quite
impressive to low-land Danes when viewed from a
valley two feet below sea level. The country is
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Lovely Land 2

totally surrounded by sea, except where Jutland's
broad neck joins Germany, and broken apart by
numerous water courses the three largest being
the "Sound", "Great Belt'’ and "Little Belt. As

if these weren't enough, the surface is so studded
with lakes, coves, bays, canals and fjords that one
wonders how any land has been able to survive at
all amidst all that water! But the pleasant land is
there nevertheless, holding up its proud head above
the ever-lapping of the hungry sea.

Denmark, primarily a farming kingdom,
devotes 75% of the land to agriculture and 9% to
forestry, while 8% is occupied by moors and dunes,
with most of the remainder being built up into vill-
ages and cities, large cities being comparatively |
few innumber. There is no mineral wealth but the
soil is fertile and, as reported in 1950, produces
three times as much grain per acre as is grown in
the U. S.A. The climate is a study in extremes,
with the long snows of its dark winters and the
"shimmering half-light-at-midnight'' of its short -
but bright summers. There is always wind, parti-
cularly in northwestern Jutland, fierce off the cruel
North Sea in winters, caressing in summe rs--but
wind enough to turn a mill or lift a sail any day.

But it is not the formation nor the performance of
the land that beckons and invites one to these far-
away shores, The great charm of the "Little .
Kingdom of Denmark" lies in the people who possess
her: their character, their customs, the manner in
which they have dressed the land; and also--and
perhaps to an even greater extent--to the colorful
history of her past, reminders of which can be seen
all around the land today.

The Danish people, subjects of a constitutional
monarchy since 1849, are at present about 4, 500, 000
in number. In the neighborhood of 26% of these live
by agriculture, 32% by industry, and a good part of
the remainder by fishing, shipping, handicrafts and
tourist service (this latter growing each year). This
was not so in earlier Denmark, when most everyone
lived by farming and fishing and a few by trade,

Even the richest nobles maintained close contact
with the soil, as well as with shipping. The country
is far more commercialized today, although
<span id="page-??"></span>
3 A Lovely Land

agriculture is still the backbone of its economy.
Though the Danes export many products, such as
porcelain, linen, glassware, silver, furniture,
fish,. etc.,, their milk,. butter, cheese, ham and
eggs, all products of their specialized agriculture,
are the most important, They help to feed Europe
and some even find their way into American kitchens.
Even though they export the best of their: dairy pro-
ducts, the Danes eat well and are likely the best:
fed European peoples today. They are not wealthy
(there are comparatively few millionaires in Den-
mark) but they attain comfort if they fall short of —
riches, These people are fairly well ‘educated,
since Denmark is one ‘of:Europe's best’ instructed:
countries; there is no illiteracy there. Compul-
Sary: education, introduced in 1814, was reinforced
thirty years later by Bishop Grundtvig' s famous ~~
"Folk ‘High Schools", which still exist. These aim
to train adult students’ in the literature, history,
georgraphy and culture of their own land, -and also
in the art-of living. Many Danes ‘can speak English
(or. think they can).

On the far east coast of the island of Zealand
lies the city of Copenhagen, or 'tKobenhavn'", mean-
ing merchants-haven. It was a small fishing and
trading village until 1536; when it becarne capitol —
of the realm. ‘Now orie of Europe's loveliest °° ~
capitols and a center of culture:for all Scandinavian
peoples, it is also Denmark's largest-city by far,
housing nearly one- fourth of her entire population,
including. the present Danish King Frederick IX and
the royal family. Copenhagen is situated on a
beautiful harbor, over which presides Denmark's
finest bronze. statue, "The Little Mermaid" sitting
on her rock, a docking place for multitudes of
great and small ships and crafts of all kinds,
bringing in products from all over the world.

But Copenhagen, despite her growing cosmopolitan
leanings and her accumulation of much that is
geared to the tastes of ultra-modern sophisticates,
is still very much of a Danish city, with her old
spires, towers, statues, palaces, churches,
bridges, and harbor canals--some dating to the
Renaissance, With typical Danish ingenuity the
Danes have managed to maintain here, as elsewhere
in their land, the image of ''Old Denmark",
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Lovely Land 4

Danish men and Danish women are not easily
swayed or changed; they seldom lose their identity
or their moorings, This seems to be one of-their
outstanding characteristics. They go about their .
business with cool-headed confidence in themselves
and their country. They give the impression that
they know where they are going and how to get
there! Obviously, Danes are not all alike; but
though there are numerous classifications and
varieties, there seems to be only one name-brand:
"Deep Down Danes", They cling to their land,
their homes and families, their friends, their
purposes and traditions with a steadfastness that is
gratifying in this fly-by-night age. However, it
would be a mistake to think of them as a somber
peoples--they are anything but that. They are
best known for their gaiety and hospitality. Any

“harshness of their lives is well cushioned with that
rare Danish humor for which they are so famous.
It is easier to think of the Danes as one big family
rather than a nation; for of all the European peoples
they seem to be the most domestic, friendly and
uncommonly happy - and especially so out in the
countryside,

And how the Danish people, one and all, love
to celebrate! Every holiday or special occasion
calls for a ''festival''; their lives are literally
punctuated with them: family festivals, village
festivals, State festivals; festivals for birthdays,
confirmations, gold and silver wedding anniver-
saries, etc., as well as house-warmings, Not
only is there a festival when the new house is first
occupied but even before, when the rafters are
raised and the roof newly placed, they fly a Danish
flag from tip-top, put a wreath around its pole and
"raise the roof and rafters' all over again! Each
family party includes everyone from Grandma to
baby. With each new festival out come the flags,
the garlands, the open-faced sandwiches, the
coffee and pastries, as well as plenty of good old
Danish beer, People make verses, songs and
toasts to the celebrated and there is as much good
cheer passed around as refreshments. What
matters if present day celebrations are not as
meaningful as those of yore, as long as there are
festivals? The Danes' summers are brief and they
<span id="page-??"></span>
5 A Lovely Land

enjoy them to the hilt; everyone moves outside.
The land itself takes on the appearance ofa
gigantic festival, with flags flying, bands playing,
and flowers blossoming everywhere: heather on
the moors of Jutland; tulips, vari-colored, on the
island of Funen; potted plants in cottage windows;
cemeteries, hedged all around, purple with pansies;
flowers massed brilliantly in parks and gardens;
balconies bright with blooms on city dwellings;
wreaths and garlands twined everywhere at the
least provocation; red poppies in the fields of
Slesvig and, mingled gaily with all, the flowered
caps of girls, It would be hard to think of Den-
mark without flowers or flags and it would be
equally difficult to think of her without bells. So
often there have been bells ringing in Denmark
from spires and towers: carillons, bells to mark
the hours and to call the congregations to worship;
happy peel of bells for weddings, mournful toll of
bells for dyings; clang of bells calling her sons to
battle--Denmark has had her share of wars.
Flowers are for summers, but bells and flags

are for all seasons in this lovely land of the Danes.

The Danish citizens are patriotic too, dis-
playing their national banner at every conceivable
opportunity and standing, heads uncovered, in city
squares; singing with gusto as bands play ''King
Christian", 'Lovely Land", or others of their
country's songs; but it goes far beyond that. The
Danes seem to have sincere affection for their
homeland and a deep sense of national pride,
especially in the storied achievements of Denmark's
venerable past, They are proud of their descent
from the bold Vikings of old who roamed the seas
a thousand years ago, though they themselves are
as peaceable as those marauding pirates of the sea
were fierce. How well these Danish people know
the legends and sagas of their native land, passed
down for generations and told them in their youth.
Who know or cares where fact takes flight and
fantasy begins? Have you heard them tell how
their land got its name? Denmark, or ''Danmark"
as the Danes have it, means Dan's Field and was
so named about 900 A.D. after the mythical
Danish champion Hoger Dansker--''who has been
seated asleep for age after age, till the day of fate
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Lovely Land 6

awakens him, but whose beard has continued to
grow until it has grown right through the board
(table) where he sits", (There is a statue of him
and his whiskers in Copenhagen.) Or perhaps you
have heard some tell of Denmark's flag, ''Danne-
brog'', meaning Danes-piece-of-cloth--"blood-red
with cross of white, it came dropping out of heaven
20 June 1219, when the elderly Danish Archbishop,
Anders Sunesen, fell on his knees on a hill during
the Battle of Lyndanisse and prayed for victory--
just the way Moses had done," They speak of the
"Three Year War'' a century ago, to save Jutland's
neck, Slesvig, from the German Holsteiners and
of the miracle that happened down there on the
blood-drenched fields; of how every spring then
the red poppies bloomed with white crosses. Such
tales are a rich part of Denmark's heritage, as _
are the stories and folk-ballads of her kings and
queens, nobles and peasantry, wars, fleets, and
of the land itself, that reach back-back-back, for -
Denmark counts her years in thousands instead of
hundreds,

There is magic in recalling the dignified
glory of her past, as told in song and stone arti-.
facts, myths and sagas; especially if one's roots
were sprouted and nurtured on her soil for genera-
tions, when the spark of one's own life was even
then within the veins of her ancient peoples. Surely
the liveliest interest and the most human should be
awakened in us of Danish descent, in this tie of
blood and place--this small corner of the earth to
which chance brought our ancestors, Someday, if
one were fortunate enough to find himself contem-
plating the story of Denmark's ancient towns,
fields and peoples spread out before his very eyes--
in ramparts of long-idle fortresses; settlements of
stone age men; Viking graveyards and remains of
"long ships' in which these fierce ones raided;
picturesque old castles, monasteries and cathedrals
where storks have built their nests for ages; magni-
ficent palaces dating to 1600 and beyond, containing
royal tombs, crown jewels and treasures of ancient
kings; low-thatched and timbered cottages, the like
of which inspired the fairy tales of that famous
story teller, Hans Christensen Andersen, ~-cottages
to which the atmosphere of fairyland still clings;
<span id="page-??"></span>
7 This Land & Its People

or if one were to find himself standing in the ancient
city of Nyborg beside Denmark's last surviving
Royal Medieval Castle, where her ''Magna Charta'"'
(Royal Charter) was drawn up and proclaimed in
1282--might not one, with surge of deep emotion,

be led to exclaim in wonderment: ''Were my
kinsmen here?"

2. WHENCE CAME THIS LAND AND ITS PEOPLE ?

Many thousands of years ago there was no
land where Denmark now lies, only sea. But then
time was one with eternity and there was no man to
count the years. Denmark's biography is shrouded
in myth, as is that of other lands. It was once
supposed by early scientists that, out of the vast
sea which covered all, land and mountains sprang
up like veritable 'jacks-in-the-boxes', Modern
scientists tell us that the birth of the land was
much more gradual; in fact that it took eons of
time, Future geologists may come up with other
theories, since they are still "digging" for the
truth. However, as of now, we are led to believe
that at the bottom of the sea, where Denmark's
land later emerged, the shells of myriads of sea
creatures piled up during the course of time, their
small white skeletons sinking like a continuously
moving veil and causing layers of resulting chalk-
slime on the sea bed to grow and become hundreds
of feet thick, Thus a massive layer of chalk-like
substance became the foundation of the new land
that rose up beneath the present areas of Denmark
and her closest land neighbors. Indications of this
can be seen today in the ''White Cliffs of Dover" in
England, the "Chalk Downs" in France, on the
Island of Riigen, and in several places in Denmark,
particularly the ''White Cliffs'' on the Isle of Mdéen
in the Baltic Sea,

As the great land masses arose the sea
retreated, Then time brought the 'Ice Age" and
great glaciers moved over the northland and locked
it in their frigid clutches. No man can tell how
often the ice melted and receded, only to return
and grip the land again, dragging icy fingers over
its surface, clawing out islets, rivers, lakes and
<span id="page-??"></span>

ridges--to lie long under the ancient stars with no
man to name them. When the great ice melted for
the last time, enormous bodies of clay and gravel
were deposited all along the line of its retreat,

But it was ages before the land was finally liber-
ated and left out to dry in the sunshine, However,
the land was not even then as it is today, for there
was one continuous stretch of it connecting most of
the European continent, Only in the northernmost
part of the present North Sea area was there any
water, All south was land except for a couple of
large rivers flowing northward where the ''Belts"
have. since appeared, As the atmosphere became
-milder this extensive land became covered with
dense coniferous forests, interspersed with rivers,
lakes and swamps, where roamed wild animals,
including reindeer and the. mighty ‘Aurochs, long
extinct.

Now a glacier can weigh upwards of 125 tons
per square foot, and when the millions of tons of
pressure was finally released from the crust of
the earth the land began to sink and the sea, fed
by the melting ice, began rising and eating its way
into the land, Then began a great struggle for
supremacy between land and sea, Century upon
century the glutinous sea flung itself in among the
trees, overflowing streams and lakes, washing >
away whole areas and sending all’creatures fleeing,
panic stricken, Catastrophic storm floods lashed
and beat upon mountains and ridges and descended
in torrents upon valleys and shores, till much of
the land gave way and was lost beneath the roaring
waters, The surface that remained was scarred
and totally changed. Out of the great travail of this
land, Denmark was born, - Jutl and and her 500
green islands.

The story of prehistoric man is also founded
only in myth, It is supposed that the first humans
to come to this area were reindeer hunters from
central Europe, following the reindeer north as
they followed the retreating glaciers, Then there
came to live throughout the ''Nordland" other
hunters from the south, with their families, who
sought their food in the great forests and in lakes

and streams. Undoubtedly life and death to those.
primitive peoples depended upon the success of
their hunting and fishing--and the caprice of the
elements, As the land was broken apart and grew
smaller and much of the forest was washed into the
sea, animals became scarcer and the age of the
early hunter was over, The inhabitants, forced

to seek their food mainly in the sea, lived on
oysters, fish and seal meat, etc, Filtering down
through the dimness of the past comes evidence
that there were such fishermen living on Denmark's
ragged shores a few thousand years before Christ.
Remains of hundreds of the settlements of these
early oyster-eating inhabitants have been found
along her coasts, The timing may be wrong but
the existence of such people is a certainty. ©
Whether they were descendants of earlier hunters
or whether they were newcomers is not known. |

As waves of the sea had swept in over this _
land called Denmark, altering its contour bit by
bit and age by age, so waves of culture swept in
over its people, molding their lives as they climbed
the great ladder of progress from savagery to
civilization, rung upon rung. About 3000 to
2000 B.C., itis believed, tribes from the south
infiltrated the domains of the oyster-eaters and
brought with them a new form of survival--agri-
culture! They taught these people how to raise
their food and domesticate animals, and they
carried with them implements of stone, including -
stone axes that meant life to Denmark's first |
farmers but death to her remaining forests, Life
there took on new meaning: the sound of axes rang,
trees crashed and new clearings appeared. To ..
this day flintstone axe blades can be found buried
in the soil all over Denmark and they. say there
are not many farms in the country without a few
specimens lying around, In fact, we are told they
have been found in the tens-of-thousands, some
complete with wooden handles, Magnificent great
stone axes and daggers have been found preserved
in bogs and beside corpses in burial tombs of that
‘stone age'' period, Since it is sincerely believed
and most probable that the majority of present day
Danes are direct descendants of those stone age
people of Jutland and her islands, is it not also
<span id="page-??"></span>
This Land & Its People 10

probable that we too have some stone axe swingers
on our family tree?

About 2000-1000 B.C. there must have come
another wave of immigration to Denmark whose
leaders wielded huge battle axes of pure copper.
Likely only the better class peasants could afford
to keep up with the copper axe Joneses since this
costly metal had to be imported from Italy, whose
merchant ships were even then trading along Den-
mark's shores. It was during this so-called
"Bronze Age'' that the Danes built trading vessels
of their own and went abroad, They had something
more precious to trade than copper, bronze or
gold--a wonderful substance, ''sea gold", ©

For along, long time the Danes have been
able to pick up from their beaches this stuff they
call ''sea gold", but we call "amber". A golden
resin, originating from the ancient coniferous
forests of the area, it gets washed out of the soil
of Germany and into the sea, whereafter it drifts
ashore on Danish coasts, Some gets washed up
from the bottom of the sea and comes to rest on
the west coast of Jutland. In ancient days girls
wore this Danish sea gold in the form of colossal
multiple chains with large center pieces and for
belts, ear rings and other types of ornaments. In
early tombs were found enormous ornaments con-
sisting of hundreds of amber beads, Danes began
using amber and soon other countries were clamor-
ing for it. Even the graves were robbed of their
"sea gold" and it was sold to people of the
Mediterranean. Denmark became famous for this
beautiful substance and early sea captains found
their way to the Baltic and took away this treasure
from "Amber-Land" (Basileia) as the Greeks called
Denmark, When Danish ships started trading they
carried furs, fish, flint, and perhaps cattle and
slaves, but first and foremost - amber! During
the bronze age Denmark apparently engaged in
brisk and steady trading, even as far as Egypt,
and became a rich land. Then this seeming para-
dise was suddenly shattered by the coming of the
Celts to Europe.

The Celts, a brave war-like people from
Asia Minor fond of ornaments and fine armor,
<span id="page-??"></span>
ll This Land & Its People

came in their chariots, led by Druid priests and,
over-running Greece, Rome and Gual (France)
landed in the British Isles. They became masters
of vast regions but they never managed to force
their way into the north countries, However, they
formed a barrier between Denmark and the south
and west and put quite a "crimp!" in her trade,
Though the Celts never came to Denmark, except
perhaps a few to trade or as prisoners of war, the
things they brought with them came - disease and
war. But the Celts also brought "iron" to Europe
in the form of weapons, instruments, chariots and
wares, More durable than stone, cheaper and
more available than copper, the Danes soon
learned to make good use of iron. By more or
less the time of Christ the glory of the "Celtic
Iron Age" had faded, Denmark had resumed her
brisk trading, and Rome set out to conquer the
civilized world, .

Caesar's legions marched through Gual and»
into the British Isles, and the ''Nordland" trembled.
But though the Roman conquerors made England
theirs for 400 years they were never able to pene-
trate far into German territory nor up to Denmark
at all. This is one reason why the subsequent
history of the Scandinavian countries and western
Europe is entirely different. True; Rome's mer-
chant ships continued to sail to Denmark to trade,
but her warriors nor the glory of her great metro-
politan culture never reached there. No stone
houses were built in Denmark during this ''Roman
Age''; no Roman roads, bridges, theaters, churches,
or Roman baths, as in other parts of Europe, ;
Though not a poor country at the time, Denmark's
people looked very poverty stricken in comparison.
Their homes were low, dark, windowless huts with
holes in the purlins to let the smoke out, The _
floors were of earth and the huts were divided into
two parts--one for cattle and horses, the other for
human beings, 'Only the upper classes wore fine
clothes, brooches and jewelry; ordinary Danes
went about in simple woolen garments or animal
hides - sheepskins for instance,

Finally the Great Roman Empire crumbled
and great troubles descended on the British Isles.
<span id="page-??"></span>

Fierce and cruel Anglo and Saxon tribes from Den-
mark's Jutland and Germany moved upon her shores
(450-500 A.D.). These famising barbarians took
over the country and struck a blow that nearly
wiped out the civilization so painstakingly built up
by early monks and scholars there. This was the
beginning of the period, so marked with turbulence
and intellectual stagnation, known as the "Dark
Ages'' or the early ''Middle Ages",

Denmark was having her troubles too at the
time. The Roman emperor, Constantine, trans-
ferred his capitol from Rome to Constantinople,
thus dislocating Europe's entire trading system.
Since the real money was in Roman trade, Den- ©
mark had traded in the south for centuries, but all
of a sudden she found that she was no longer ina
favorable position for trade, Trade lines, hereto-
fore moving from north to south, now started to
move from west to east through the Baltic Sea and
thence, via Russian rivers, to the new hub of the
Mediterranean, This led to trouble in Denmark's
waters as her islands became trading stations
enroute and plundering targets for pirates. A
competitive battle began between Denmark and
Sweden, the Swedes being particularly determined
to gain control along Russia's river courses,
Trouble also started for Denmark on her south
Jutland border as hostile Germanic tribes gained
control of some of her territory there, No longer
were Danish tribes permitted to wander at will
down through the continent of Europe by way of
Jutland's neck, as heretofore. A population sur-
plus developed in the land. Trade cut off and
migration stymied, it seemed that the Danes' only
great hope was to take to the sea - and this they
did en masse, together with other Scandinavians,
with the most unusual consequences! The next few
hundred years produced the strangest chapter in
Scandinavian history.

3, VIKINGS WERE THEY

In the eighth century something formidable
began to stir in the north countries - the curtain
was going up on that dynamic drama, the "Age of

the Vikings''. Bursting upon the scene almost like
spontaneous combustion, raiders in tall-masted
"long ships" shoved off from the coasts of Denmark,
Sweden and Norway, their aim not so much war as
plunder, The concurrent scenes enacted by these
barbarians (let's face it) were backed by no con-
certed plan and no strategic political aims, Every-
thing just erupted in some overwhelming fashion,
"Suddenly the Swedes, in a current of marauding
vigor, struck southward through Russian rivers to
Constantinople", Dano-Norwegians sailed from
Norway to the Mediterranean and harried the
shores of this inland sea, Norwegian buccaneers,
ina far-ranging impulse, sailed to Ireland, Ice-
land, and presently across the Atlantic to Green-
land, with Leif Ericksson, son of Eric the Red,

and on to the American continent (long before
Columbus), which they called ''Vinland'"', meaning
Wineland, Danish Vikings rowed along the coasts
and up the rivers of France and England and, leap-
ing ashore without warning, plundered and burned
villages, farms, estates and convents, taking off
again before word could get around, Like destruc-
tive tornadoes these Vikings swept in all directions,
bearing terror and death, and none could stay them.
"From the rage of the Norsemen deliver us, O
Lord" was the prayer that rose up from far and
near.

What the word ''Viking'' really means nobody
knows; probably the ''men from the fjords", since
Vik in Danish (Vig in Norwegian) means alittle.
fjord. Danes and Norwegians often joined in'their
raids, it was difficult to distinguish between them.
The Viking Age is said to have generally begun
with the attack on Lindisfarne, on the northeast
coast of England, 8 June 793. ''This was by no
means the first raid on a French or English coast,
but on this occasion the plunderers' attack was on
a famous English convent, Episcopal residence and
well known seat of learning, Its holy inmates were
killed or dragged off as slaves by these barbarians",
The report sped down through western Europe and
everybody was shocked and horrified - but this was
only a start! In 835 the Viking storm broke with
all its fury; whole fleets, of sometimes 300-400
vessels at a time, launched wholesale attacks,
<span id="page-??"></span>

taking spoils and prisoners, These Vikings seemed
to be completely fearless and without pity, sacri-
ficing their prisoners to their Nordic gods or
selling them as slaves. War was their chief occu-
pation and slaves their chief trade during those
convulsive decades.

One of the most renowned Vikings of all
times was Ragnar Lodbrok, or ''Hairy Breeches",
born in Norway but a member of the ruling family
of Denmark. This hero sailed up the Seine in 845,
with 120 ships, ravaging Paris and the country on
both sides of the river. The French King Charles,
who challenged him, was forced to take refuge in
a convent, Charles finally bought him off with
7,000 lbs, of silver (''Danegeld"') and Ragnar sailed
home. Next this Viking turned against England's
Northumbria, where he was finally captured by the
King there and cast into a snake pit to die amid a
coiling mass of loathsome adders, Ragnar had
four sons, and as he drew his last breath he
muttered this potent threat: ''The little pigs would
grunt now if they knew how it fares with the old |
boar'', The old Norse legend tells how his sons
received the news: "Ironside gripped his spear
shaft so hard that the print of his fingers remained
stamped upon it, Hvitserk was playing chess but
he clenched his fingers upon his pawn so tightly
that the blood started from under his nails. Siguard
Snake-eye was trimming his nails with a knife and
kept on paring until he cut into the bone; but the
fourth son was the one who counted. Ivar-the-
Boneless demanded to know the precise details of
his father's death and his face became red, blue
and pale by turns and his skin appeared puffed up
by anger",

Ivar was a warrior of command and guile and
he sought bloody revenge. He was the mastermind
behind the Scandinavian invasion of England in 866-
67. His powerful Danish Sea army brought a near
end to the Kingdom of Northumbria and a horrible
death to her king; destroying her dwellings,
churches, and monasteries with fire and sword and
with them masterpieces of Angelican art and the
culture of Bede, Alcium and Caedmon. Nothing
was left but roofless walls, Northumbria never _

again acquired any sign of her former greatness,
But Ivar's army didn't stop there - it marched on,
taking East Anglia and into Mercia, ''The Vikings,
with their brightly painted shields and banners,
their finery and golden bracelets, made the Saxons
seem modest by comparison, As they slowly
_approached their foes they clashed their. shields
and weapons and raised long, repeated war cries
as their missiles began to fly".

Other Viking armies returned again and again,
No one knew when or where they would strike; the
English kings and their armies could not be eve ry-
where at once. Then the Danes began staying
longer each year and soon they brought their
families and began taking over the land. During~—
that century the Danish Vikings literally streamed
into England, until the whole areas of northern and
eastern England and the Midlands became one large
peasant community called 'Danelagh", The raids
and the settling kept up until more than a fourth of
England's inhabitants were Danes - or descended ©
from them, The threat to England became deadly:
earnest.

Other Vikings went to France. and. their chiefs
became rulers of sizable areas of Flanders, In
fact, they were on French coasts every single year
and the French king's only resort was to buy them
off with '"'Danegeld" - but they always returned. —~
In desperation, in 911, the king granted a Danish
chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French), Normandy as a
fief on condition that he would protect France from
other Viking invasions, He promised but took it
lightly and Danes continued to raid and settle as
he did. Rolf retained Normandy and his. grandson
became the Duke of Normandy, later known as"

and took over England in 1066. 2 EE

The real soul of the Vikings lay. in 1 the Nong
ships''. The Scandinavian peoples had succeeded |
in creating a craft that for its day was. undoubtedly
the finest in Europe. Every detail was the result
of thousands of years spent on the sea, Models of
such ships have been dug up almost intact, the
most famous in Gokstad, Norway in 1880. "It is
76 ft, 6 inches from stem to stern; 17 ft. 9 inche's

amidship; clinker built of solid oak planks fastened
with tree-nails and iron bolts and caulked with cord
of plaited animal hair; with sixteen oars per side,
varying in length between 17 and 19 ft. and beauti-
fully shaped with the mast 40 ft. high. It could
carry a smaller boat or 'dinghy', a crew of fifty,
and if necessary another thirty warriors or captives,
in all weathers, and could ride out the fiercest
storms of the Atlantic Ocean. Such were the
vessels which in many different sizes bore the
Vikings to the plunder of the civilized world, to
the assault of Constantinople, the siege of Paris,
the foundation of Dublin, Ireland, as well as many
parts of England and the discovery of America",
Their pictures rise before us vivid and bright:
their finely carved dragon-shaped prows; their
high curving sterns; their long rows of shields,
black and yellow, alternately ranging along their
sides - the gleam of steel, the scent of murder,
Yet these super instruments of sea power would
have been useless without the men who handled
them; all were volunteer leaders of marked ability
and as good at the helms or oars as they were with
their swords, We are told that men between 16-60
were chosen but none without a trial of ability and
strength,

And then one came who was able to halt the
on-rushing might of these overwhelming Danish
Vikings, or at least to temper it. Had it not been
so all England would have been put under the yoke
of these plundering settlers, That one was Alfred,
a Saxon king called ''The Great", partly because of
his ability to challenge these warriors and some-
times win, All through the years of his reign King
Alfred's armies and those of the Danish Vikings
waged deadly war, with little to show on either side
much of the time but scars and corpses, Though
it was more than a century after his death before
the Age of the Vikings came to a close, yet he
showed that they could be stopped and pointed the
way whereby his descendants took up the success-
ful challenge.

Sir Winston Churchill, in his chapter on the
Vikings, found in his "History of the English Speak-
ing Peoples'' (Vol. 1) - from which much of this
<span id="page-??"></span>
17 Vikings

material on the Vikings has been gleaned - writes:
"When we reflect upon the brutal vices of these
saltwater bandits, pirates as shameful as any
whom the sea has borne, or recoil from their
villainous destruction and cruel deeds, we must
also remember the discipline, the fortitude, the
comradeship and martial virtues which made them,
at this period, beyond all challenge, the most for-
midable and daring race in the world. . , From
Yorkshire to Norfolk this sturdy, upstanding stock
took root and thus the bloodstream of these vigor-
ous individualists, proud and successful men of
the sword, mingled henceforward in the English
race, a vivifying, potent, lasting and resurgent
quality".

There is no denying the terror let loose by
the Vikings in western Europe and elsewhere.
Thousands of people were killed or forced into
slavery. Thousands of widows all over Europe
had reason to curse the Vikings of Scandinavia.
But naturally these bloodthirsty expeditions
claimed thousands of Danish lives too, either
slain or drowned; and despite the fact that these
dead had nobody to blame but themselves, the
events as seen from Denmark's side on the home-
front were often dismal enough, And there were
widows in Denmark too, standing along the beaches
every autumn, staring vainly out to sea as ships
returned home - or did not return, Many tomb-
stones were raised in Denmark for Danes who
never returned with their ships, Kipling caught
the picture in his 'Harp Song of the Dane Women!":

"What is a woman that you forsake her
and the hearth-fire and the home-acre
to go with the old grey widow-maker ?"

Denmark's adventure of a thousand years ago
may appear as a brief, confused episode to the
descendants of that country called the British
Isles; peopled by ancient Britons, invaded by
Celts, then conquered and occupied by the Romans
for 400 years, then invaded and conquered by
Angles and Saxons, then by Danish Vikings, and
finally by Norman Knights under William the
Conqueror, their origin is so tangled that they
can scarcely be blamed if they are not excited
<span id="page-??"></span>
Vikings 18

about where they came from and how. Yet on the
other hand, Danes and their descendants represent
one of the few peoples in Europe that have never
suffered from large-scale invasions or population
transfers, They can really claim, for the most
part, to be descendants of the Danes of the Stone
Age. They can point with pride to the ancient
Vikings, knowing full well that generation after
generation their Danish ancestors have called
Jutland and her islands home! They know they
are of the blood of Vikings and that the romantic
days of the "long ships'' were perhaps among their
progenitors! brightest. Perhaps Danes dream of
their great - grandsires "Anders the Ploughman"
and ''Christian Red Whiskers" standing at the
prows of high masted ships or rowing at them,
streaking toward Normandy or the British Isles,
Or do they think of their many, many great-
grandmothers, 'Karen Lauritzdatter'' and ''Maren
Christiansdatter' standing on Jutland's beaches as
days begin to chill, gazing out hopefully for signs
of sails? Cannot we too meditate and dream of
these, since we are of the blood of Vikings? Is

it not necessary to know who one really is?

4. PEASANTS - NOBLES - KINGS

The basic processes of life go on much the
same in all ages - man lives and loves and mates,
his children are born and he buries his dead. But
oh, how varied is the breadth and depths of living,
how contrasted the quality and color, as each man
seeks his place under the everlasting stars, Living
can be as different as black and white, rough and
smooth, songs of birds, and butterflies wings. No
peoples have actually been the same - no places,
no ages - nor have the influences that have affected
them. Though historians have grouped and catalogued
them, individuals must have always been quite
different, even in Old Denmark. Surely there were
those who led; the in-betweens and on-the-fences;
the aggressive - the rebels - the weak. But whether
richmen, poormen, stone age-men, peasants,
nobles or kings, people as well as nations have had
to learn to get along with each other if they wished
<span id="page-??"></span>
19 Peasants-Nobles-Kings

to succeed, or even to survive; thus, during the
seemingly endless process, various forms of
government have evolved. .

In ancient Denmark a freedom-inspired,
communal sort of living was the vogue. Independent
farming settlements or tribes were the governing
bodies and individual peasant families the units,
(''Peasant" referred to one who worked with the
land, so all "Danes" were peasants to begin with. )
Each settlement had its own tribal councils, called
''Thing'" meetings, where decrees were recited
from heart by the "lawman!" and peasants discussed
matters and made decisions. All major projects”
were on a cooperative basis and each man had his
say and, though some undoubtedly spoke louder
than others, liberty was very much alive! As the
country became more populated men came to think
that ''war'' was the way to succeed, Settlement.
chieftains began fighting each'other for desirable
tracts of land that gradually grew into small king-
doms, The successful war lords were the fore-
runners of the Danish nobility. Before the time of
the Vikings Denmark was pretty well divided into.
separate kingdoms, and the greater land holders.
had gained the status of ''nobles'' - there were
likely even those who had set themselves up as-
"kings", Nevertheless, the peasants were still
largely in control - they were a stubborn lot and
hard to suppress. Freedom was their heart-throb
from the start! vat : SENS

: We have called this land ''Denmark" from |
the beginning but it really had no special name _
until about 900 A,D., at the time it was first _
united into one kingdom. A Viking sea king, who
became more interested in his own land than in >
others', fought and brought all of the- Danish area
under his rule and for a time was also king of ©
Norway. King Harold Bluetooth (app. 935-985),
son of King Gorm and Queen Thyra; “began to be |
in favor of peace and of staying home and building
up his kingdom; but the war-minded nobles, who.
couldn't forget the fun of being Vikings, felt.
differently. The King's son, Sweyn Forkbeard,
was their leader and the opposing forces fought.
The king was slain and Sweyn became king —
<span id="page-??"></span>
Peasants-Nobles-Kings 20

(app. 985-1014), He called the nobles and peasants
together and with his main chieftains, ''Torkil the
Tall" and "Oluv the Fat'', sailed to England and
harassed her king, ''Ethelred the Unready", until
he subdued him and became king of England too.
His triumph was short however, for the very next
year this ''Caesar of the North'! fell off his horse
and died, (The English contend St, Edmond slew
him.) Canute the Great (1018-1035) fought and
added part of Sweden to this fantastic North Sea
Empire, and though he was a good and mighty
monarch he died young. Sad to say, under the
reigns of his incompetent sons, Harold Harefoot
(1035-1040) and Hardicanute (1035-1042), the great
empire toppled and England slipped through the
fingers of future Danish kings, King Sweyn Estrid-
son (1047-1074) tried to regain his famous Uncle
Canute's vast English holdings and sent. Viking
fleets there to defeat William the Conqueror, but.
was unsuccessful. From then on the two countries
more.or less turned their backs on each other.
‘Though they sometimes fought, cultural and com-
mercial bonds were severed and each went their.
own way and wrote their own histories for about
the next eight hundred years. As long as the
Viking fleets were free and manned by volunteer
peasant raiders, and as long as there were settle-
ment chieftains to organize them on their own
initiative, the Danish Vikings continued to be a
terrifying threat to their western targets; but
when the Kings took over and forced the issue,
that business of raiding simply petered out. Den-
‘mark never again reverted back to what she had
been before and Christianity began to take root
there,

.. Since kings are only people and since people
are different, so were the Danish kings and their
performances, as a brief commentary on some
who ruled during the early Middle Ages tends to
indicate, Canute the Holy (1080-1086) introduced
a tax for the benefit of the Church (10% of all
harvested corn) and imposed heavy fines on the
peasants who rebelled in North Jutland, from
whence he was forced to flee to a cathedral where
they slew him, Because famine followed his
death--and miracles are said to have happened at

his tomb--he became Denmark's Patron Saint,
Oluf Hunger (1086-1095) ruled through nine years
of famine. Eric Egode meaning ''the only good
one" (1095-1103) so named because the crops
began to grow again in his reign, wasn't really
good. So he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land
as a penance and became the first European King
to do so, though he died enroute. Since it took so
long to get word back to his subjects, he ruled
Denmark for nearly a year after his death--believe
itor not. King Niels (1104-1134) sat peaceably —
upon his throne, steadily attending to the affairs
of State like some ancient Scandinavian nobleman
farmer, But he bored the modern knights and
nobles, who forced him into battle over Slesvig .
(South Jutland) in his declining years, Eric
Emune (1134-1137), hard, brutal.and generally
loathed, was condemned at a ''Thing'" meeting and
slain by a Jutlandic noble, ''Black Plough", Eric
Lamb (1137-1146) the inadequate, almost let the
kingdom fall apart, since each peasant settlement
began governing itself as it had before the country
was united, In practice, the person of the Danish
king still meant so little that the peasants had
small difficulty having things their way.

"The Great Period of the Valdemars" (1146-
1241) began with the ''War of the Princes", wherein
three royal contenders fought bitterly for the throne.
They divided Denmark into three parts, one for
each; but at a banquet to celebrate the peace, ;
Canute was slain, Valdemar wounded, and Swen
Grathe blamed. He fled but in his flight was killed
by a Jutlandic peasant, who ''split his skull with an
axe'', King Valdemar the Great (1157-1182), whose
mother was Russian, reunited the Kingdom and be-
came the first of three successful kings to rule
during one of the most progressive and prosperous
times in Danish history. The last of these, Valde-
mar the Victorious (1202-1241) won much territory
for the Crown, especially from Germany. (It was
in his reign that the great battle took place at
which the Dane's flag 'Dannebrog'"' supposedly
floated down from heaven as a ''sign from God."')
But just when things were looking wonderful for
the country, the king was taken prisoner and held
for years while the Germans regained Holstein,
<span id="page-??"></span>

When released, Valdemar fought again to win back
the land but was victorious no more--~he lost the
battle, one eye and a son in the fray. Shortly
before his death he drew up a Set of national laws,
for up to this time Denmark had no uniform or
written ones, Since rules and regulations were not
always remembered alike by the 'lawmen!" of the
various settlements, there were often problems.
This 'Jutlandic Law" proved most successful in
solving these.

King Eric ''Ploughpenny" (1241-1250), so
called because he instigated a plough tax, had
trouble with the Church. Eric Clipping (1259-1286)
made peace with the Church but had trouble with
the nobles, They felt the time had come to curb
the king's powers and made him sign an agreement
to that extent. (Royal Charter of 1282) This gave
the nobility much more say in the Danish govern-
ment but it didn't bring peace. One terribly
stormy night the King, who was hunting in Jutland,
was forced to take refuge in a village barn. A band
of nobles fought their way in and attacked him,
leaving him dead with 56 wounds, Legal action was
taken, under terms of the new Charter, and nine of
the country's leading nobles were found guilty,
among them the Lord High Constable Stig Andersen
Hvide (most likely one of our grandmother's distant
relatives, and ours). He was banished and retired
to an island in the Kattegat where he lived like an
ancient Viking - raiding the Danish coasts.

Two kings in succession nearly wrecked Den-
mark, Eric Menved (1286-1319) and Christopher Il
(1320-1326 & 1330-1332) mortgaged most of the
country to pay for their extravagances, until not
one single square foot of land remained in Dane's
possession. Denmark was without a king for nearly
eight years and the king was without a kingdom,
while her wealthy German masters built their
castles all over, levied crippling taxes on her
peasants to pay for them, and sent ruthless German
soldiers to collect the money. By 1340 the country
seemed doomed; rebellion was seething throughout
the land, but especially in Jutland. A powerful
Count, "Gert the Baldheaded" of Holstein, marched
up into the peninsula with an army of 11,000 men,

intent on quelling the trouble at its source. But on
the night of April lst a Jutlandic Squire, Niels
Ebbesen, crept in and slew the great Count in his
bed chamber, The news sped swiftly all around
Jutland and her peasants geared for battle, In the
face of it all the invading Germans lost their cour-
age and retreated south without fighting. Denmark
was saved! Niels Ebbesen became a national hero.
(There is a statue of him in Randers.)

King Valdemar 'Atterdag", sometimes called
"the evil" (1340- 1375), won little affection in Den-
mark but he won back the land, bit by bit, all
except south Slesvig, He was on his way to confis-
cate that when he suddenly died "of an unfortunate
remedy for curing gout.'"' (During his kingship the
terrible bubonic plague [Black Death] struck, claim-
ing almost half the Danish population.) Though he
had no scruples he was one of Denmark's most_

short of miraculous. At his death his daughter. ;
Margaret (1387- 1397) wormed her way in and had
the. nobles proclaim her, not as queen: but as 'Dame.
of our Kingdoms, Master of our Houses, Mighty
Guardian". She united the three Scandinavian:
countries under one ruler, to be elected. jointly;..
and this union lasted, on and off, with Sweden for
126 years, but Denmark and Norway remained
united for 434 years (until 1814). , With Margaret,
the familiar intimacy of nicknaming Danish kings
ceased, then heraldic names were p sed * and later
numbers,

Sitting astride the "Sound", ‘Detimark had
controlled this entrance to the Baltic Sea, one of
Europe's busiest channels, since ancient times.
Her king, Eric of Pomerania (1397- 1438), anta-
gonized all the seafaring nations by introducing
"Sound dues'', He decreed that all who passed
through there ‘should pay toll, and to. make sure

to dip their flags, strike their topsails, and pay

of money to Denmark but endless political misery
as well, This king is described as having been

very handsome, with ''a beautiful physique, golden-
yellow hair, a ruddy complexion and a long, slender
neck which he covered with a linen cloth fastened
with a golden brooch. He would leap into the
saddle without the help of stirrups, and all women
were drawn to him'', The peasants finally rebelled
at his autocratic rule and the nobles followed,

. Tiring of it all he abdicated, hied himself to an
island and pensioned himself off as a pirate, His
nephew and successor, Christopher of Bavaria
(1439-1448) joined with the nobles against the
peasants, whom they tried to subjugate entirely.
When the peasants rebelled in northern Jutland the
King went in person at the head of an army and
dealt them a bloody defeat.

So the self-willed Barons, Counts and Knights
of Denmark were having their day. It had become
a tradition to award all the highest ecclesiastical
posts in the Danish Catholic Church to the Danish
nobles as political plums. Under these aristocratic
leaders the Church took over a great deal of the
good land and became rich and powerful. Too,
assemblies of nobles and high churchmen (Rigs-
raads) had largely taken over control of the govern-
ment, under the kings whom they elected.

5. THE WAY OF WAR

"The ladies stood in Highloft
their lord's return to see
But every steed with blood was red,
and empty each saddle-tree,
The Knights bore out their shields
and then must many weep."

--Ancient Danish folk ballad

Time was when Danes thought the only honor-
able death was a violent one, Denmark has had a
terrible record of wars:--peasants uprising against
nobles or kings and vice versa; nobles up-in-arms
at the kings or the clergy; the Crown fighting the
nobility or the Church. Then, if Danes were not
scrapping among themselves they were warring
with their neighbors--and no wonder. For the
<span id="page-??"></span>
25 Way of War

greater part of a thousand years Denmark had to
maintain a two-front postion involving constant
threats from Sweden on her northeast and Germany
on her southwest, with Russia always looking
through the window. It was as though a pair of
grasping pinchers had been suspended over the
little Kingdom, Time and time again she has
fought Sweden for the supremacy of Scandinavia
and the Baltic, and so often she has been at war
with powerful, dynamic Germany over the pro-
vinces of Holstein and Slesvig (Schleswig in Ger-
man) which have been batted back and forth since
the days of the Vikings.

The small Kingdom has been ruled by
"Christians" and "Fredericks", with one King Hans
thrown in, for the past 520 years, Forty-four
years before Columbus came to America the first
King Christian ascended the Danish throne--and
the fighting went on as usual. Christian I (1448-
1481) went to Sweden to settle matters there and
his fleet won at sea, but it is said that as the two
land armies advanced upon one another each leader
prayed to St, George (of dragon fame) for victory.
As the Swedes could pray in Latin and Christian
only knew how in German, the Danes lost, The_
Dane's king was more fortunate in the south how-:
ever, for he united Slesvig and Holstein under his
rule, He established the first Danish University
also, King Hans went to war and united Sweden
with Denmark and Norway again, but had to give
all their nobles much greater power. He built the
Danes' first proper navy (ships especially for war)
and established their first naval base.

Christian Il (1513-1523), a dynamic, violent
king with a big, red beard, loved beauty and culture,
and he loved the Danish peasants too, He enacted
measures which benefited them and curbed the.
powers of the nobles, This caused a terrible my
breach between them. He occasionally fell back
on an ancient legal practice and called in twelve
peasants from a village and had them pass judge-
ment on a wayward noble, according to ancient
Nordic custom, which they usually did with these
words: ''Not we but his deeds do judge him",
Christian II went into exile but was captured and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Way of War 26

held prisoner in his own land for 36 years, at the
command of his two successors, both of whom he
outlived. The peasants fought to free him and make
him king again, which brought on ''The Counts War",
a great internal struggle involving tremendous
bitterness and bloodshed.

Frederick I (1523-1533) had to win the crown
by force and maintain his position in the same way,
for the peasants wanted the old king back, When
Christian ITI (1535-1559) was throned, the peasants
in north Jutland really rebelled; they marched
against a well-armed force of Knights sent to quell
them and inflicted a crushing defeat--then marched
south, setting castles and manor-houses ablaze,
Then the new King sent his army after them under
his cruel Holstein general, Rantzau. The peasants
retreated north and made a stand at Aalborg but
Rantzau's troops took the town by storm, plundered
it thoroughly, slaughtered its inhabitants plus 2, 000
other peasants who stood their ground there, Soon
entire north Jutland was subdued and its peasants
either executed or deprived of their ''freeman"'
privileges, These forces then turned to Copenhagen,
whose citizens were for the old king, and laid siege
there. For more than a year her people held out--
famine struck and they ate every cat and rat and
even chewed the grass growing on the ramparts,
while their dead piled up everywhere and they were
forced to surrender. Christian III did away with
the Catholic Church and installed Lutheranism in
its stead, He made the convents and monasteries
fiefs of the Crown and confiscated all Church pro-
perty, which was considerable, From then on
there has been no separation between Church and
State in Denmark.

The lack of education of Frederick II (1559-
1588) was appalling but his times were scholarly.
(Denmark then had one of the finest scientific
institutions of the day.) He fought a ''Seven Year
War" with Sweden, with no gain. Nor could he
eonquer his own appetites--he loved wine and
drinking cut short his life. His son, Christian IV
(1588-1648) became Denmark's most renowned
king, the one the Danes know best and for whom
the national song, 'King Christian'', was written,
<span id="page-??"></span>
27 Way of War

He was a worker and a builder and founded towns
and made improvements from one end of his realm
to the other, He was jovial and his court was gay;
loved music and fostered organ building; spoke
several languages, founded colonies in India and
elsewhere--and in fact he simply popped his nose
into everything! But he made a mistake when he
tried to aid certain German factions in their own
thirty-year religious struggle--and Denmark's
Jutland paid the price, She was terribly ravaged
by Germans, who destroyed her towns and pillaged
her manors, Then the Swedes followed the Ger-
mans in and ransacked Jutland all over again,
Christian IV became battle weary, disappointed
and impoverished, His second wife divorced him,
his friends deserted him, his many children took
sides against him, and he had trouble with his
sons-in-law, Lonely, bitter and practically for-
gotten he died, after having ruled Denmark longer
than any other king (60 years), during which time
Queen Elizabeth, James I and Charles I sat on the
throne of England, in turn; the Puritans and Pil-
grims sailed in droves to New England for
religious freedom and the Atlantic Ocean replaced
the Baltic and Mediterranean seas as monarch of
the trading routes,

Germany and Sweden continued on the war-
path during the rule of Frederick III (1648-1670)
and each marched again into Jutland--there wasn't
much left of her! The whole of south Jutland was
paralyzed and very nearly depopulated, and it
looked as if the Danes' land was at last to be
divided up between her two perennial enemies,
Denmark saved her neck, fortunately, but was
forced to sign the most expensive peace treaty
of her life, giving Sweden a third of all her pro-
perty--in fact, all of her territory east of the
Sound, which included the valuable Scanian
provinces, This was the most serious territorial
loss she ever sustained. Then the Swedish king
decided he might as well have all of Denmark
while he was about it, so he sailed back and fell
on Copenhagen unexpectedly. He laid seige to the
city and, despite the fact that practically the whole
of the rest of Denmark was in Swedish hands, her
citizens decided to fight. Everybody got into the
<span id="page-??"></span>

act: the King pitched his tent on the ramparts in
defiance; a friendly Holland fleet fought its way
throughto help; women, children, students and
citizens worked side by side and civilians and
troops trained for battle. It was six months
before the city was stormed (10 Feb. 1659) but
the Danes were ready! While the men fought,
women and children loaded muskets, dragged
wooden beams and huge stones to be heaved down
on the heads of the enemy and heated lye and water
to boiling, to pour down if they tried to clamber up.
Hour after hour and attack after attack the Danes
fought tenaciously until the Swedes finally had
enough. At least 3,000 of the invaders died but
only 20 Danes, Copenhagen was free, Denmark
was saved--but the prevailing mood was one of
deepest gloom because of the destitute, crippled
and reduced condition of the nation. The nobles
were blamed for it all but were too enfeebled to
rise up against anybody. So the King considered
this an excellent time to have his full say and,
after astute negotiations, proclaimed himself
"Absolute Monarch'! of Denmark and Norway. It
was very unusual but there was no bloody revolu-
tion at all.

About this time the nobles were required to
take definite surnames to be retained by succeeding
generations of their posterity, in lieu of the patro-
nymic pattern of surnaming then in common use in
Denmark; ex, --the addition of the suffix "sen" to
the given name of one's father, ifa male, and
"datter' if a female. This new order of naming
was designed to more fully identify the nobilities
and their descendants from the commoners, Kings
had been similarly set apart by nicknames,
heraldic titles or numbers since the beginning.
Peasants were not required by law to discard the
patronymic form until 1828 in most cities and 1856
in general.

Christian V (1670-1699) built up the Kingdom
and gave it a Statute Book of new laws by which he
ruled honestly and well. One of the bloodiest
battles ever fought in all of Scandinavia took place
during his administration, when he and his army
crossed over into Scania to try and win her back
<span id="page-??"></span>
29 Way of War

from the Swedes, The main battle started off the
dark winter morning of 4th Dec, 1676 with the
cavalry forces of both armies rushing against
each other, It lasted all day, and that evening,

as rain drizzled down and darkness fell, almost

9, 000 Danish and Swedish corpses lay stretched
out in the muddy fields, It was a war of senseless
havoc and destruction and the Scanian provinces
were completely devastated, (These people were
of the Danes own.) The Danes won at sea as usual
but lost on land, and Sweden retained Scania,
(Would the Danes then never learn?) Legend has
it that from that day on Christian V had the windows
of Kronborg Castle in Elsinor, which faced Scania,
blocked up; he was unable to bear looking out
across the water toward the green coast of the
Danes' lost land.

When the American colonies wrote their
Declaration of Independence and started the
American Revolution, Christian VII (1766-1808)
had been on the Danish throne for ten years, but
he was quite incapable of ruling. Less than
seventeen when he took the crown, he was slight
of build and it soon became apparent that he was
slightly mad too, (It is said that his chamberlain
was no doubt largely to blame--he believed in
using a firm hand and had cowed the young Prince
by beating him.) His personal physician moved
himself up in the government, post by post, until
he gained absolute power and held the King in the
hollow of his hand, as it were. But the doctor was
finally condemned to death by popular demand, At
this time the Dano-Norwegian fleet was strong and
trading excellent, Slesvig and Holstein were under
Danish control, but relations with England were at
low ebb and war with Russia was threatening,
Denmark's industry was awakening and the famous
Royal Copenhagen Porcelain factory was founded,
Intellectual life unfolded; art, painting, drama,
poetry, all came to the fore, Danes re-discovered
the beauty of their ancient Nordic past and wrote of
gods and goddesses and of love of their country.

A spirit of nationalism grew and blossomed. One
of the popular songs of the day was written by a
Holstein bard:- 'Let me rejoice that Danish blood
within my veins doth flow''--and Danes everywhere

took up the refrain.

But the Danish peasants then, unfortunately,
had little to sing about. They had been largely
deprived of their ancient freedoms, Most of their
''Thing' meeting privileges had been taken away
and they could no longer own land. Though they
continued to live closely side by side in small vill-
ages and cooperated in cultivating the community-
owned property as in ancient times, they were
forced to rent their individual farming land from
the nobility or the Crown. For the use of these
lands they paid "manorial dues", a good part of
which had to be worked off on the estates of the
owners, The power these aristocratic bosses and
their overseers wielded over the peasants was con-
siderable. These often had to leave their own
plantings and harvests to work endless hours taking
care of those of their masters, Little these cared
if the peasants! crops failed from forced neglect
and they were thus unable to pay the balance of
their 'dues''--they could work those off too (or
take a beating in the bargain), Many were com-
pelled to forfeit their fields and were reduced to
little more than slaves, Others made out quite
well and obtained a "'copyhold" on the farms they
rented, so that their sons could take them over
from them at their deaths (though a land owner
might transfer a son from a good farm to one that
was neglected), Then, from the time of Christian
VI (1730-1746), pleasants had been "bound to the
‘soil'', This meant that all men in the rural areas
were bound to remain living on the same estates
or in the same villages or districts for the entire
period in which they were liable for military ser-
vice, at which time they were forced to fight in the
King's armies. Though peasants moved very little
anyway, they felt that they were really being pushed
around !

Frederick VI (1808-1839), who governed for
his ill father as Crown Prince before he became
King, served the Danish people for a total of fifty-
five years, He set about early to improve agricul-
tural conditions and to give the peasants of his land
a new lease on life. He decreed that they could
now own their own land, consolidate their various
<span id="page-??"></span>

fields, and decide for themselves how hard they
toiled, If they continued to work for the nobles,
from necessity or choice, their hours of labor
were limited by law to give each peasant some
time for his own fields or affairs, This was a
great reform, and in gratitude for it a monument,
"Liberty Obelisk'"', was erected to the "liberation
of the peasants'' and stands today in the center of
Copenhagen, It wasn't long until the old communal
villages were abolished and the more progressive
peasant-Danes moved onto their own farms or into
neighboring small towns.

. Since the middle of the 18th century the most
common flag seen on the Seven Seas, after the
British, was that of the Dano-Norwegian merchant
navy. The latter part of that century England had
lost the American Revolution and was now involved
with the French, She began casting her eyes on
Denmark and Norway (after generations of ignor-
ing them) in hopes of embroiling them in this fight
as allies, But the twin countries managed to keep
themselves free of entanglements for a time and
enjoyed a period of tremendous prospe rity in ;

to enforce this, started seizing Dano-Norwegian

was, ''Free ships, free cargo!' The situation
became critical, Early in 1801 England sent a
fleet into Danish waters under Admirals Parker >
and Nelson, It was a most strategic time since
Denmark's allies' ships (Russia's) were ice-bound
and her own fleet was in winter quarters, dismantled
and crews demobilized, After bombing Elsinore °
the English sailed straight for Copenhagen with:35
ships, 1,192 guns, 14 cannons and 8, 885 experienced
men against a hurriedly gathered Danish force of:
630 guns and 5,234 men, mostly volunteers. After
five hours of violent lopsided fighting (though the
Danes fought bravely) the Danish forces were
defeated, over half being wounded and hundreds -.
killed. But the Danes spirits were not defeated--.
their spunk was up, and they continued their trade
and tried to steer clear of the flames of war, The

Napoleon's Empire and his starting to do just about
as he pleased with all of Europe. Then Denmark
and Norway, with the second largest fleet in the
world, decided to join with England, in spite of
her earlier attacks on the Danes; since to go
against this world's greatest maritime power
would be catastrophic for them,

Denmark enjoyed six more peaceful years,
with trade as usual, but apparently forgot to con-
vince England that she was on her side, because
on the last of August 1807 Crown Prince Frederick
was visited by an English envoy who demanded that
Denmark enter into an alliance with his country and
hand her over the entire Dano-Norwegian navy in
pawn for the duration of the ''present situation."
Now Frederick was down on Jutland's Neck with
‘most of his army, preparing for battle with
Napoleon's forces who were marching towards
the Danish border, He couldn't believe the English
were serious (after all, they were now friends!)

He said he would "think it over", then hurried to
Copenhagen to see what was going on, and arrived
just as a huge English fleet with 30,000 men, was
casting anchor in the Sound. He made meager pre-
parations for an attack there, still doubting it would
come, and rushed back to Jutland to await Napoleon,
The English delivered a final notice and then, as
the Danes were silent, prepared to bomb Copen-
hagen from all sides, Indignant, to say the least,
its citizens got ready for battle, as they had 150
years ago with the Swedish. There were some

100, 000 inhabitants crowded behind the old ram-
parts of the city but only 12, 000 men able to fight.
For three days the bombs reigned down upon them--
they hadn't a chance and had to give in. This time
the fleet was to be war booty, not a pawn. Two
days after, flames were still crackling in the
houses and smoke still pouring through the streets,
while approximately 2,000 corpses still laid
unburied and more than I, 000 people lay wounded,
wherever space could be found, The English
seized the royal dockyard and all the storehouses
and occupied the harbor, All ships were made
ready for sea; those they could not take were
hacked to pieces, Every single thing was stuffed
on board, even to the last chart and telescope;
<span id="page-??"></span>
33 Way of War

whereafter the entire Dano-Norwegian fleet then
stationed there, was hauled out of the harbor for
the last time. There went the pride and joy of two
kingdoms gliding out to sea. ''The beaches were
black with people watching in deadly silence as
their beloved vessels slid slowly past--and Danish
naval officers wept.'' The whole affair seemed so
absurd, There was no proof whatsoever of any
hostile intentions on Denmark's part or of the
necessity of attacking Copenhagen at all. (We
can't take anything away from the English though,
for they were gentlemen all the way--they left
commissioners behind to pay for their board and
room and gallantly left a pleasure frigate that had
been presented as a gift to the Crown Prince by
his uncle, the King of England.) There were com-
plaints in many quarters outside Denmark, includ-
ing some of the members of England's own House
of Lords,

Denmark was sucked into the European
whirlpool, there could be no doubt now where she
must stand, She joined with Napoleon and, though
for seven years England controlled her territorial
waters, waged a gunboat war against her, Norway
was the hardest hit, as her coasts were blockaded
till famine came, and in the midst of it Sweden took
her over, This terminated the 439 year union be-
tween the twin kingdoms, Norway and Denmark.
Denmark's days of prosperity were over. The
war with England had completely destroyed her
maritime trade. Her tiny distant colonies were
cut off and her national economy was bankrupt.

She had nothing left outside her poor, beaten,
country except Greenland, the world's largest
island (mostly a cake of ice), the Virgin Islands
(which she later sold), the Faroe Islands in the
northern Atlantic, and Iceland. (Incidentally, _
Iceland and Denmark had been united under the
same kings for 564 years, when Iceland took
advantage and dissolved this union abruptly, as. .
Denmark struggled for her very existence under..
the occupation of the Germans during Herr Hitler's
rampage of 1939-1944, This Icelandic treatment
was a last straw; it was like kicking a pal when he
is down. )

Things looked pretty black, but Frederick VI
still sat on his throne with his dearly beloved family
about him; 'he was father to his people and their
contact with the past, which seemed to be collapsing
so unmercifully". But the country still existed--
Denmark had survived another catastrophe. She
had often been involved in the political strife of
Europe, often ravaged by foreign troops or written
off as an independent State by her neighbors; but
she had never been completely conquered or sub-
jected to foreign dominion--somehow she had
always managed'‘to pull through. Oh yes, she had
had her days and her moments, but the country was
too small to stay "great". Slowly trade started
again and shipbuilding, poetry-making and painting.
(Danes then mostly painted ships--great. men-o'-
war with billowing white sails ploughing through
the water, in and out among the bright green
islands, )

When the old King died in 1839 he was gen-
erally mourned, With him a whole era passed to
the grave--a Denmark that would never return, It
was an era of reverses and deep disappointments,
and perhaps mistakes, ''but after all it was asking
quite a lot to be able to steer a Ship of State
unscathed through the typhoon that Napoleon loosed
over Europe.'' Danish peasants carried the King's
coffin along the last part of the road from Copen-
hagen to the cathedral in Roskilde, where Den-
mark's royal heads are buried. He had truly been
their friend. —

- Christian VIII (1839-1848), the old king's
cousin, was bitter and disappointed; for though
Danish ships were sailing again, things were not
the same. It was much too obvious that Denmark's
position among nations had sunk so low that she
hardly counted anymore. There was sarcastic
criticism of the old autocratic form of government
in many Danish circles, and when King Christian
VIII died, after nine years of rule, the crisis came
to a head, His son, Frederick VII (1848-1863),
was neither loved nor admired, There was unrest
all over Europe, Shots were ringing out in the
streets of Berlin and Paris, "In Denmark feelings
mounted to such extraordinary heights that a number

Way of War 36

Since Frederick VII had no sons the Danish
crown passed, as per treaty, to Christian IX of
the House of Glucksburg (1863-1906). Both he and
his queen belonged to the old Danish Royal House.
It has remained with him and his direct descendants
for the past 104 years, or to the present. The old
headache of Slesvig and Holstein came up again and
war with Prussia and Austria resulted--they came
and took away the two provinces, so Denmark was
reduced again. Frederick VHI served for only six
years (1906-1912), but his son, Christian X, ruled
35 years (1912-1947) and had the two great World
Wars to worry him. World War Iwas not so bad,
as Denmark tried to stay aloof, but 100 of her ships
were hit by German submarines, with no considera-
tion at all. Two good things came of it however:
Danish women got the right to vote and the League
of Nations gave Slesvig the right to vote too on
where she wished to be, and only north Slesvig
subjects chose Denmark, and so Jutland's neck was
finally divided up and thus it remained.

The small-land-Danes have actually only lost
28 miles of their original territory to big, husky
Germany over the centuries they have been fighting
for it. But they nearly lost all of Denmark in World
War II, when Hitler's Germans moved in on them,
Had it not been for the efforts of their 'Freedom
Council", who engaged in a saboteur's war, aided,
and directed in the end, by radio from England,
they could have. Denmark fought from within and
the whole thing was a nightmare! A noble effort
was made .in behalf of the Danish Jews, 8,000
strong. The Gestapo had their eyes on them and,
after nearly four years of occupying their country,
decided on the ''High Holy Days'' to tend to their
extermination. But it never happened, for the
Danish risked everything they had to save their
fellow Danes, the Jews. In brilliant feats of cour-
age on all sides, those of the underground helped
the Israelites to escape to Sweden and safety; few
were lost. There have been no race riots in
Denmark--only wars.

When it was announced that Hitler was dead,
and the Danes realized the war was nearly over, it
was feared that the final battle would be fought in
<span id="page-??"></span>
37 Way of War

Jutland and Denmark braced herself for the attack
as, hour after hour, the fighting front came closer,
The final phase of World War II was enacted,
literally, on the Danish border. When word

finally got around that the Nazis had capitulated,
Danish resistance groups began settling accounts
and taking care of a few matters, and the Germans
and the Danish traitors couldn't get out of the
country fast enough! In Denmark there was the
biggest festival of all:--cheering, laughing, dancing
in the streets, and Danish flags flapping all over.
She was saved again.

In the thousand years in which history has
accounted for the royal heads of Denmark, there
have been over a half hundred ruling there--good
kings, bad kings, a dead one and a mad one, and
one uncrowned queen, By far the majority of
these have been sober-minded, sensible people.

It seems that there has always existed in Denmark
an ancient, unfailing ability to choose, more or
less, the right leaders, Frederick IX is ruling
there now and has been for the past 22 years
(1947- ), Greenland has been made a Country
instead of a Colony, one house of the Danish
Parliament has been abolished, ''Landsting", and
women lately have at last been given equal rights
to become Danish rules, just as men. Since
Frederick IX has no sons, his daughter Margrethe
is heir apparent and will likely become Denmark's
first crowned queen, The feeling still persists
that in Denmark, in spite of the blackest days,
things can never go really wrong; for she has
always pulled through inthe past, But--her
position at the gates of the Baltic is still vulner- |
able, as always, and one cannot help but think
that Russia (the Great Bear) has her eyes on her
andis mightily interested in seeing how she handles
herself and that gateway. Then, during the last
few decades, Denmark's government has leaned
heavily toward Socialism. One cannot help:
wondering if freedom once again is gasping for
breath in that lovely land of the green islands.
War is not always the way.

6. OTHER DIMENSIONS

Far back in the history of Denmark, its
people must have felt that there was something
greater, stronger and more glorious than them-
selves--something they ought to fear, reverence
or worship. Surely this feeling, this belief, this
upward urge was a part of the makeup of our first
Danes, as it was with other prehistoric peoples,
and as it is with us, Of course there would have
been the doubting Thomases, the self-sufficient--
or shall we call them skeptics--who live by the
rule of the known dimensions and never take stock
in anything they cannot see, hear, smell, touch,
taste, or perhaps heft, These there will always
be; the individuals, through whose well-walled
thinking "the intangibles" never filter nor do they
leave any mark upon the conduct of their lives.

Palle Lauring, in his book ''A History of the
Kingdom of Denmark"! (from which so much of the
information about this country was taken) has this
to say about the Danes first--shall we call it
religion? 'Among prehistoric Danes, apparently
whether anything went right or wrong, was a ques-
tion of fate, The powers-that-be decided one's
luck and thus one had to pacify them, protect
oneself against them and, if possible, be on good
terms with them, There was hardly a question yet
of real gods, Spirits lived in streams and marshes,
and offerings to them were made everywhere, The
woodland lakes were black and dangerous, so
earthenware vessels containing food and amber
pearls were lowered into the bogs and marsh ponds;
magnificent great stone axes were consigned to the
streams; meat was deposited on sacred stones; and
in spring and autumn, the all-important periods
when all matters were decided, it is likely that
sacrificial-feasts were arranged."

", . . At the same time there was some
thinking being done about the dead. They should
be allowed to take what was theirs along with them
when they were buried, for in the next life they
might need their things. Nobody wanted the dead
to come back in order to claim their property--
the dead were dangerous, So weapons and jewelry,
<span id="page-??"></span>

etc., were buried with corpses. . .. When the
farmer replaced the hunter there was a new type
of thinking, or what we might call a 'new religion’.
To plough the earth was to cause it pain, to clear
the forest was to offend it; therefore, sacrifices
had to be made to trees and stones and you had to
be friends with the sun, (Nothing was known of
the chemistry of the soil or of the sprouting of
seeds or plant diseases,) Whenever anything

went right or wrong, it was fate!"

Nordic mythology was the only religion of
the Scandinavians for ten centuries. This form
of believing followed the ''fate'' period among these
norsemen, When the Danes and their colleagues
‘began to feel a little better acquainted with the
vast unknown, the spirits, whom they feared or
worshiped, took the forms of legendary people,
‘gods and goddesses and demigods galore, to whom
they paid their respects,. Some of the days of the
week were named after various of these; for
example, Wednesday was for Wodin or Odin, who
ruled in the heavens, the great all-father god of
these early Danes. They thought he lived ina
palace made of gold and silver, called Valhalla.
Two ravens stood on his shoulders and he sent
them to fly around the earth to give him news of
all they saw and heard. Round him stood maidens
with helmets, spears and shields, called Valkyries,
who were sent down to earth to bring the souls of
heros slain in battle to feast forever with Odin in
his great hall Valhalla. When the thunder rolled
and the lightning flashed, in the course of a wild
storm, Danes would say, eyeing the sky, ''There
goes the mighty Odin and his warriors riding into
battle in their great carts, lashing their steeds,"'
Thursday got its name from Thor, ‘the‘strongest
of Nordic gods, who had a great hammer which no
man could lift, a pair of powerful gloves and a belt
which, when fastened round him, doubled his
strength. Sometimes when the thunder roared it
was not Odin riding, but ''Thor banging his huge
hammer", Friday was named for Frigga, wife of
Odin and goddess of marriage, supreme among all
the Danes' goddesses. The rainbow in the sky was
the bridge by which the gods rode to their home,
Asgard,

Early Christian monks were said to have
visited Denmark, but with no success, During the
course of the Viking raids on England, the Danes
were often ''exposed'" to the influence of Christianity
but it was more or less like ''casting pearls before
swine", It is said some Vikings even permitted
themselves to be 'marked with the sign of the
cross", prior to baptism, when they were in foreign
climes but that when they came back home they
"washed off the baptism' and once more paid their
respects to Odin and Thor, "It was not because
their souls were false but simply because they
regarded Christ as God in western Europe and
therefore it was as well to be on good terms with
him while in his countries. But at home in Scand-
inavia, Thor and Odin were still gods and naturally
one couldn't fail them, ''!

Denmark's king, Harold Bluetooth, personally
became converted to the Christian faith and tore
down his father's old pagan altar at Jelling and
built a church. He tried to convert his people to
Christianity but it was impossible to convert a
whole nation of tradition-bound pagans all at once
and he had little success, Canute the Great became
a devout Christian. His greatest triumph, outside
of the establishing of his fantastic North Sea
Empire, was when, on Easter Sunday 1027, "he
strolled up the aisle of St, Peters in Rome beside
Conrad (who was that day crowned Emperor), as
his guest of honor and witness",

But the Danes were still heathens, worshiping
their pagan gods, for almost a thousand years after
the first solid Christian churches were established
by the early monks in western Europe. It wasn't
until King Sweyn Estridson took a hand that the
Danes began to be Christians to any great extent.
Under him the Danish Catholic bishoprics became.
firmly established, the churches became extra-
ordinarily numerous and the area divided up into
ecclesiastical parishes, Stone church buildings
appeared everywhere (the first ones had been of
wood), These were mostly austere, stern and
simple, like the old Anglo-Saxon ones in England;
but in Funen and Jutland they were ornamented
with a ponderous type of primitive scuipture, among

the most impressive created in Europe at that
time.

One of the most prominent Middle-Age
Christians in Denmark was Archbishop Absalom,
who served during the Great Period of the Valde-
mars, He wrote the Danish chronicals from which
have been gleaned so much of Denmark's early
history and folklore. Then, the Danish Christian
church was ruled under the direction of the Pope
at Rome. Of the more than 1, 700 parish churches
existing in Denmark today, roughly 1, 500 date
from the Valdemar period or before, Big cathe-
drals grew more numerous then also; but, though
there were churches a plenty, they were not able
to eradicate the Danes ancient thinking about many
things, Their verses still contained tales of mer-
maids and water sprites and stories of the dead
returning to haunt the living; maidens flying to
their loves in suits of feathers (transformed into
birds); men having raven-spells and flying by
night; and fairies dancing in the meadows and
dwelling in ancient grave mounds and, if they
invited a young swain to come to them and he
resisted and fled, they took most fearful revenge!

"There is dancing in the churchyard
Dancing girls with flowing hair".

Trouble between Church and State had been
going on in much of Europe for ages but it really
didn't begin in Denmark till around 1250 and from
then on, for the next two-and-a-half centuries,
there was trouble between Danish rulers and the
bishops. Good terms between these two forces
were re-established about 1500, when it became
the custom to award most of the high posts in the
church to Danish noblemen who supported the
Crown, The Danish Catholic Church then became
very rich, especially in real estate, and its chief
activity took on more the nature of grandiose
estate management than religious service, All
churches, both large and small, were lavishly
decorated with expensive murals in glowing colors,
art and woodcarvings, mostly imported, golden
altar pieces of beaten gilded copper, The monas-
teries were prospering too. But among the peasants,
ancient pagan beliefs refused to disappear and

relics of their old heathen cults were still to be
observed for, after all, ''Rome was far away",

On ''Wakeful Nights" the young men and girls of

the villages went to the churches, taking their beer
casks with them, and danced and made merry.
Night life in the churches was not exactly Christian,
"but to avoid offending the images of the pious
saints on such occasions, their pictures were
turned with their faces to the wall''. Thus, though
there was no longer a gap between Church and

State in Denmark, there was a big one between the
Church and its congregations. An extensive feeling
of unrest in religious matters was felt as the
Danish Catholic Church's hold upon the population
slackened.

So there was not much to stop the new
religious doctrines of the reformer, Martin Luther,
which were then being formulated in Germany,
from seeping into Denmark and the existing church
there was unable to strangle them. Fanaticism
and mass excitement in religious movements were
uncommon in the Dane's history, for there was
usually cool sobriety among them where religion
was concerned, Then, too, at this time the Danes
had the ''Counts War'' to think about--war was
another thing! When the bloodshed was finally
over, the death knell of the Catholic Church in
Denmark was sounded, King Christian III pro-
claimed Lutheranism as the religion in his land
and all who opposed him were forced to give in.
Though all Catholic bishops were imprisoned in
one swoop, they were released on condition that
they get out of the country or join the Lutheran
Church. Most of them stayed and changed over,
Acts of violence were few and the struggle was
nearly over. Now ali these new Lutheran clergy
were required to do was to perform their religious
duties and keep their noses out of other matters--
no more land grabbing or politics! Thus the
Reformation was carried out rather simply in
Denmark,

When absolute monarchy was introduced in
1660 the Danish churches became the property of
the State and Lutheranism became the national

were required to belong to this State Church and
baptism was compulsory. This law was rigidly
in effect for the next 189 years, On 5 June 1849
an assembly of great significance to the people of
Denmark was held in Copenhagen, for it was then
that their new constitution was signed. Among
this document's stipulations was one regarding
religious tolerance. The Danes had taken a great
step toward freedom once again! It had taken a
long, long time to prepare the land of Denmark
and her people for the coming of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ to her shores,

Four months later another assembly of
great importance to the Danes was being held
thousands of miles to the west, It was harvest
time in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, but in
that two-year-old community onthe American.
frontier the main interest of its inhabitants was
not in the fields of golden grain but in the October
Conference then in session in the completely filled
Bowery. Here on this late autumn day, 7 October
1849, the emphasis turned to missionary work. A
passage from the Bible (Rev. 14:6) was read:--
"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them
that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people.'' This prophesy,
believed to be the destiny of the new church whose
members were gathered there, could be fulfilled
only if more foreign missionaries were sent out,
The Latter-Day Saint church had opened the
British Mission in 1837 and the South Pacific
Island Mission in 1843, but this had been only a
start, It was felt that now was the time to expand
the program. Members in attendance held their
breaths, so to speak, as name after name was
read out as having been selected to go on a foreign
mission--to France, Italy, Great Britain, the
Society Islands--and Elders John E, Forsgren
to Sweden and Erastus Snow and Peter O. Hansen
to Denmark,

themselves and their families for the long separa-
tion. The company was organized for traveling and
on 19 Oct. 1849 left the Salt Lake Valley, number-
ing 35 men, 12 wagons, 1 carriage, and 42 horses
and mules, This was the first company of mission-
aries sent from the Rocky Mountains, The journey
proved long, tiring, and at times even dangerous.
On Monday Nov. 12th the group was attacked by
about two hundred Cheyenne warriors, on the

Platte River, but escaped unhurt, On Friday,

Dec, 7th, after two months, during which time an
over-ruling Providence was clearly made manifest
in their behalf, the missionaries arrived at Ft,
Kearney on the Missouri River, It took another
five months before Elder Peter O. Hansen arrived
in Copenhagen (11 May 1850) the first L. D. S,
missionary to ever set foot on Danish soil. A
native of Denmark, he hoped to convert his own
people and some of his friends, but they would

have none of it, On 14 June he was joined by
Elders George P. Dykes, John E, Forsgren and
Erastus Snow, the latter to serve as president of
the infant mission, with Elder’ Hansen as inter-
preter, The four humble missionaries immediately
shut themselves up in the upper room of a hotel in
Copenhagen, where they offered a prayer of thanks-
giving for their safe arrival and dedicated themselves
to the service of the Lord; while ribald carousers
held forth in a bar directly below far into the night.
At that time Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland
and Finland were placed under the ''Scandinavian
Mission" with headquarters in. Denmarks' capitol
city, and remained so until divided in 1905 and the
"Copenhagen Branch" was organized, with head-
quarters in Copenhagen, ©

So the gospel seed was sown in Denmark, for
better or for worse, and on 12 August 1850 the
harvest of souls began. On this date the first
Danish LDS baptisms in this dispensation took
place when 15 candidates, mostly Baptists, .
entered the clear waters of Oresund, immediately
outside Copenhagen, and received this important |
ordinance, In writing to the First Presidency,
August 17th, Elder Snow said, ''The Lord has
visited the believers with many visions and dreams
and manifestations of the Holy Spirit. They have

drawn out of us, by their faith, everything per-
taining to the gathering, the redemption of the
dead, etc., and drink it in as an ox drinketh up
water. . .'' Later he told how some of the early
investigators there had seen the Elders in vision
and knew them on arrival. And again, reporting

to the authorities in Zion he wrote, "As far as’

my experience and observation extends, the Danes
are a kind, hospitable people, especially the middle
classes, and higher tone or morality pervades here
than exists in corresponding classes in England and
America; and if I mistake not my feelings, the
Lord has many people among them,'' On the 25th.
Nov., a second Danish branch of the Restored:
Church was organized, the ''Aalborg Branch" in
northern Jutland, with headquarters in the city of
Aalborg, (This has been in continued existence
ever since and is still one of the largest and best
branches of the LDS Church in the Scandinavian
countries.) By the close of the year 1850 there
were about 135 members of the new church in
Denmark and things seemed to be going pretty

well for them and their church there,

But opposing forces were stirring and pre-
paring for battle. It seemed certain that the same
unhallowed persecutions which followed the preach-
ing of the gospel in ancient days would become an —
integral part of the experience of these nineteenth
century disciples, even here among the liberty- _
loving Danes, The Clergy of Denmark's State
Church brought all the anti-Mormon falsehoods
that they could find from America and England
and after inventing a few of their own, inveigled
the Danish press to join in the campaign against _
these so-called ''Mormons'', Even the Bishop of
Zealand, ranking Bishop of the Lutheran Church ©
in Denmark, issued a pamphlet which catalogued
the usual filth against them, Here is a quotation
from an article which appeared at the time on the |
front page of ''The Tidende'"', one of the most.
popular and respected Danish newspapers in
Copenhagen, claimed to be reprinted from a paper
in Paris which had printed it straight from a paper
in London:--'"It is reported on good authority that

of Latter-Day Saints" (known as Mormons from
the title of a so-called new Bible they call the
Book of Mormon) is now sending representatives ©
to proselytize in Denmark. For the past dozen
years these Mormons, who style themselves also.
Saints, have been preaching with good success
among the lower classes of England. We feel it
our duty to issue warnings to our brothers in the
north countries, having discovered for ourselves
the nefarious purposes to which these men have
put their religious teachings, They are recruiting
whatever members of the European working and
peasant classes they can find, who are ignorant
enough to listen and be influenced, taking them to
American West where they are treated as indentured
servants.

". , . Some thirty-five thousand converts in
thirteen years have been made in England, of which
more than five thousand have emigrated already to
a barren wilderness they have the affrontery to call
'Zion', as if the wandering children of God were
being taken home according to the prophecies in the
Old Testament, . . We need hardly to point out that
this is a most lucrative business for the so-called
Authorities in America, They have now begun to
charter whole ships, which sail out of Liverpool,
their agents profiting from ship and railroad
rebates, as well as excess baggage charges,
while they fleece the poor and ignorant emigrants
at every step. But this is only the beginning of
the profit, of course, for the priesthood on the
other side of the Atlantic, and we are appalled to
consider the possibilities, once these poor people
are forced to labor as they are told or die in the
wilderness, Assistance is given them to leave
their homes, but none to return.

"This is an appalling story, a church that
dares to give itself a Christian name, proposing
to take the poor of the earth into an earthly heaven
and then, for unquestionable obedience, to eternal
rewards, Instead, the faces of the emigrants are
ground into the earth, ‘tithes of time and toil' are
exacted from them, and their labor is exploited,
while they struggle to repay their debt to the agents
who persuaded them to the enterprise.

"There are well-founded rumors here that
not only are the poor exploited in Utah--called the
‘Promised Land' by these erstwhile missionaries
even now preaching on our streets--but that young
women are especially susceptible to their ideas
(as young women will forever be when men are
good looking and unscrupulous, with money in
their pockets) and are later forced, by poverty
and desperation, when they are once in America,
into illegal marriages with the so-called 'Apostles'
of the Mormon Church."

Blasts against the infant church continued -
coming from press and pulpit. The Elders in
Denmark decided not to answer these charges
openly but to go on quietly holding their meetings,
improving themselves in the language, and aiding
Elder Hansen in the Danish translation of the Book
of Mormon (whose sheets finally came off the press
22 May 1951), They did not advertise their meet-
ings but they continued to be filled at the appointed
hours, not only with faithful members and sincere
seekers of the truth, but with ruffians and others
who were there for no good purpose at all. The
opposing clergy labored with students of church-
sponsored schools to join apprentices and the.
rough-necks who attended the Mormon services,
to break up the meetings, and this they often did;
but that isn't all they broke up, as the following.
quotes from ''History of the Scandinavian Mission",
by Andrew Jenson, indicate:--''While visiting with
a few Saints in Vendsyssel, Elder Dykes, who had
been having great success in the Aalborg Con-
ference, was met by a mob, who beat him and
threatened his life. The ruffians broke all the
windows in the house in which he was visiting and
the tile came crashing from the roof as the house
was generally demolished. But with the aid of
some friendly women he escaped through the back
way and returned to Aalborg. Attacks of this kind
were not unusual against all the brethren but these
men were not easily discouraged and they found ~
many of the honest in heart for whom they were ©
seeking, in spite of all the angry rumblings, "'

Sunday, 22 June 1851, ''Elder Hans Peter
Jensen and his missionary brethren announced a

public baptismal service to take place in the open
waters of the Limfjord, near Aalborg. A great
number of people gathered to witness the event.
Before proceeding with the ceremony, Elders
Jensen and Christian J. Larsen spoke to the
assembled multitude, advising them to flee from
"the Church of the Devil'', intimating that the
Lutheran Clergy represented that church. Bed-
lam broke loose and the Elders were dragged by
the mob before a prominent clergyman of the city.
The mob went to the Saints meeting house, broke
all the windows and tore the doors down. Soldiers
were ordered out that night to restore a semblance
of order, but before their arrival a severe thunder-
storm broke, the likes of which had seldom been
seen in Aalborg, and the mob scattered, . . For
six nights more the depredations were repeated,
with the mob intent on almost any crime; but a
check on all missionaries and members later
disclosed that, while there were bruises and tales
of narrow escapes by the missionaries who had
been at their wits end, all had escaped serious
personal harm,"

Nov. 1851--"'A mob, fanned to white heat by
their own fanaticism, burned the home of Jacob
Bohn, chanting 'Let's baptise the Mormon Priest
in his own blood' soon after it was discovered that
he had joined the LDS church as the first convert
in Randers, But Brother Bohn came back after
the fire and praised God that his journal, contain-
ing about fifty hymns he had written, had not been
destroyed, "'

On Sunday, 14th Dec. 1851, four of the
brethren held a meeting at Brondbjoster, a
suburb of Copenhagen, and many of the Saints had
come out from the Capitol City to attend the ser-
vices, '"', . . As soon as the meeting was dis-
missed and the visitors began to disperse and
start on their return trip to Copenhagen, they
were greeted with a shower of stones, potatoes
and other missiles, from a crowd which lay in
ambush waiting for them. After proceeding a
little farther, someone gave a signal that the
Saints were coming, and when they came within
the firing line they received another salvo of
<span id="page-??"></span>

potatoes and stones, Still farther on, men and
women, who had posted themselves along the
hedges and in trenches, came out to take an
active part in the unequal battle between the

Saints and sinners. Some ofthe assailants were
armed with heavy sticks and clubs, md stones and
dirt flew thick and fast. Some of the women car-
ried missiles in their aprons with which to supply
their male companions, while they, in a blas-
phemous manner, cried out, 'Now call on your
God to defend you!' Some of the brethren were
knocked down and rolled in the muddy road and
beaten with sticks and fists; their coats were

torn to pieces in several instances and even one
of the Sisters was abused and handled very roughly.
For more than half a mile the mob pursued the
Saints in this manner, and when they at last came
to a farm house by the roadside and sought shelter
within, they were not safe there either and fled
across’the fields in the darkness, still pursued by
their "Christian" friends, until they reached
another farmhouse where they also sought shelter.
But its occupants refused; however, a friendly-
disposed girl kindly showed them a way out through
the garden into the fields, and they finally escaped
from their pursuers,'' One of the sufferers said
of this occasion, --''For three quarters of an hour
we were seemingly in the hands of the devil, but
while God permitted him to have power over our
flesh, our spirits rejoiced, for we knew we
suffered for the cause of truth. One cannot des-
cribe the suffering we passed through, but for a
short time it certainly looked as if none of us
would escape with our lives.'' The missionaries
and Saints in Denmark never fought back to save
their lives, but were advised to follow the admoni-
tions of the Savior, who said, --''When they perse-
cute you in one City, flee to another",

the right of freedom of religion, it was not backed
up by the collateral laws nor by the moral force of

by law, and public meetings curtailed or broken up,
the Saints had to hold their gatherings in private
and often in secret. (It was worse in Norway and
Sweden where there were no laws at all aimed at
religious liberty.) Sometimes the meetings were
held in people's barns. Numerous ones were
started when ordinary citizens were asleep, and
not until the call of the nightingale heralded the
coming of dawn did the meetings close. If mission-
aries were accused of infractions, such as holding
meetings when forbidden, preaching the gospel,
baptising or what have you, they were taken before
the various authorities and fined for the crimes of
practicing their beliefs, If they didn't or couldn't
pay the fines they were jailed in lieu of these, and
fed on bread and water; then they were just as apt
to hold meetings in the jails as not, After being
released they would immediately start preaching
again and continue until re-arrested on the same
charges. Sometimes mob action became so violent,
seemingly with police consent, that meetings had
to be discontinued entirely for periods of months;
but the Saints went steadily on, praying in their
own homes; the missionaries went quietly on asso-
ciating with and preaching to the members in their
homes; and the mobs, made up mostly of men and
boys, continued to meet in greater numbers for a
time, but had to be content to spend their fury on
themselves and the rented meetinghouses.

In some parts of the countryside in the
mission, citizens joined in a conspiracy not to sell
anything to Mormons or to hire anyone who was
known to have been baptised. Children of Mor-
mons were mocked and mistreated in school and
the Lutheran Clergy advertised the names of new
Mormon converts so that they could be shunned
and hated by their fellowmen, Anti-Mormon pam-
phlets, filled with misrepresentations and false-
hoods, were continually being published and caused
considerable opposition to the work of the Lord in
Denmark, There was much hostility toward the
Saints in most places. But despite the seemingly
untiring efforts of all opposing forces combined,

the LDS church continued to grow and prosper in
Denmark,

At the General Conference of the new church,
held in Copenhagen in April 1853,''it was announced
that membership in the Scandinavian Mission then
‘numbered I, 331, of which 1, 133 were Danish, 88
Norwegian and 110 Swedish. Baptisms of members
_wére well over a thousand for éach of the years”
~1856; 1857, 1858. At the close of the year 1859"
the Mission contained 3, 934 baptised members of
the Restored Church, 2, 512 in Denmark. : These. .

7. EMIGRATION CAN BE A MAGIC WORD

"The courage and devotion of the Saints who
had their roots.in Denmark, and other of the
Scandinavian countries, and whose lives were
modified by the Gospel, have been seldom equaled.
The posterity of the thousands of these Latter-day
Saints, who left their homes in that bright land for
the sake of the Gospel, should remember them with
fervent gratitude and thanksgiving !'"' (So wrote
Doyle L. Green in 1950, Managing Editor of the.
Improvement Era.)

"Gathering to Zion'' was not stressed among
the Scandinavian members of the Restored Church
until 1852; but when it was, it was found that the’
Danish people were ready and eager. The incessant
persecutions, in nearly all parts of the Mission,
increased their desire to emigrate. Accounts of |
the growth of the Church, in the tops of the beautiful
mountains far away to the west, were often relayed
to the Northland, urging the Brothers and Sisters
there to ''come to Zion and help build up the king-
dom !'"'" The scriptures were searched and it was
pointed out that. those who answered this call would
surely be assisting in the fulfillment of prophecy;
for was it not written in the Holy Bible about such
things? They read from Micah 4:1-2: "But in the
last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of
the house of the Lord shall be established in the
top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above
the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many
nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go
up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of
the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways,
and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go
forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem.'"'

The Saints of the mission were counseled by
the Elders to do all in their power to practice
thrift and save to emigrate to the Valley of the
Great Salt Lake. Though some 17 Danish Saints
had emigrated independently in 1850, the first
organized emigration from the Scandinavian
Mission, under Church direction, took place Il
Mar. 1852, when 28 members, mostly Danes,
<span id="page-??"></span>
53 Emigration

sailed from Liverpool, England in the ship "Italy",
bound for America and 'Zion''. (Ole Ulrick
Christian M¢nster, a former Baptist and one of
the very first LDS converts in Denmark, was in
charge of this group.) In 1855 quite a group of
Saints from Iceland were among those emigrating
to Utah. They settled in Spanish Fork among a
thriving group of Danish Saints there. By the end
of 1857 upwards of 2, 000 Scandinavians, mostly
Danish, had left the mission bound for Zion's
headquarters in America. That fall, all foreign
missionaries of the Church were called home
because of the coming of Johnson's Army to Utah,
which threatened war. This supposed ''Utah War'!
never took place however, but Mormon conversions
in Denmark were lowered because of shortage of
missionaries, and emigration for the year was
reduced to 70.

In Utah a Church Immigration Fund had been
set up to help the incoming Saints and from which
they could borrow for their passage to Zion.
Church wagon trains were often sent to the
Missouri and Mississippi River junctions to meet
companies of the poorer Saints and bring them on
west across the plains. At the close of 1860 part
of the tithing collected in the foreign missions,
heretofore used for the expenses of the mission-
aries, branches and conferences in those areas,
was made available for the emigration of the poor,
of whom there were many. From then on the
Danish missionaries, as well as those in other
foreign missions, had to sustain themselves,
while funds for the maintenance of branches and
conferences were raised by the free-will offerings
of the local Saints. Thus these members were
tried and tested: but it seemed that the added .
sacrifices and efforts brought manifold blessings
in their wake, A great spirit of brotherhood grew
in that northern mission, It was as if a magic
wand had been waved over the heads of all its
members, with the accompanying command of
"Let there be charity among you!" It is heart-
warming to learn of the love and sacrifices of
these people for each other and the gallant
generosity of the more prosperous in behalf of
the less fortunate of their associates, For
<span id="page-??"></span>

example, --''Brent Nielsen was so free in outfitting
his brethren and preparing their passage that he
was warned by the missionaries that some might
accept the money and then apostatize. To Jacob
Bohn, the hymn writer, he said: 'You need never
repay me because you labor for God's Kingdom";
... 'Jens Andersen of Veddern, Aalborg County,
assisted no fewer than sixty of his fellow converts
to immigrate; but, like Moses of old, he was
never permitted to set foot-on the promised land,
as he died enroute on the North Sea in 1862, soon
after leaving his native Denmark";..., "Andrew
Eliason, a well-to-do Swedish land owner, sold
his estate and paid the passage for a hundred of
his Brothers and Sisters in the Gospel to start

out for Zion.'' In 1862, in New York, it was dis-
covered that many of the poorer Saints lacked
funds to continue west, The financially able
Scandinavian emigrants immediately donated
money to assist their less fortunate friends west
to Florence, Nebraska, where they were met by
Church trains with supplies and means to take
them onto Zion, ''A Danish brother, Lars
Petersen, about 30 years of age, who had assisted
about twenty poor Saints to emigrate, was acci-
dently drowned in the 'Weeping Water', a stream
near Wyoming, Nebraska, where he, together with
others, went to bathe. He was buried June 28th
with much expression of sorrow by the sympathizing
Saints.'' These compassionate desires of the
more wealthy of the brethren to help those in

need often made it possible for friends and neigh-
bors to go to Zion together.

The price of emigration seemed high and far
above the reach of many of those who desired to go.
It was announced that for each adult the cost was
150 Rigsdaler ($75, 00) provided one walked across
the plains; but if one wished to share a wagon with
seven other adults it would cost 200 Rigsdaler
($100.00) each. Those expecting to emigrate
under the above terms were to send their money,
names, ages, occupations, dates of birth, etc.,
to their respective Conference presidents, advanc-
ing at the same time 40 Rigsdaler for each handcart
emigrant or 80 Rigsdaler for each one planning to
go by wagon, This money was forwarded to America
<span id="page-??"></span>
55 Emigration

for the purchase of equipment for the journey
across the plains, such as handcarts, wagons,
oxen and provisions. In 1865, due to the inflation
brought on by the Civil War in America, the price
of everything was higher there. A wagon that year,
at the outfitting places, was about $200.00 in
greenbacks or $100.00 in gold, and a team of oxen
sold for about $150.00 on the average.

An amuSing story is told of a group of
Danish emigrants of 1853, on the American Plains
near Keokuk, Iowa, where they had received their
oxen and wagons for the journey westward:--''Some
of the Danishmen, disliking the American way of
driving oxen in yokes, hitched up their beasts of
burden in regular Danish fashion, But they had
forgotten one thing--the oxen were American,
The poor beasts were half frightened to death and
started out ina wild run. A council meeting was
called in which it was decided that it would be
easier for the emigrants to learn American ways
than it would for the oxen to work with Danish har-
nesses, Too many of the oxen had never been hitched
up before and this, coupled with many inexperienced
drivers, soon added up to many upset wagons in”
gullies and ditches."

Indeed, all was not roses! Though anti-
Mormon opposition died down in Denmark for a
few years, in 1860/61 it again rode high in some
parts of that country, especially in northern =
Jutland. It became impossible once again for the
Saints to hold public meetings there. -Fuel was
added to the flame of hostility when it became
known that a group of Scandinavian emigrants had
apostatized, in 1862, near Omaha, Nebraska, on>
their way to Zion, They wrote many-false reports
back and numbers of their letters wére printed in
Danish newspapers with relish, Some of the sec-
tarian priests reprinted the letters in tract form,
adding their embellishments, and feélings against
the Mormons raged, Elders and Saints alike
were mistreated because of these malicious reports,
The renewed rantings against the Restored Church
however only accelerated its successes; baptisms
increased in the Mission and so did emigration,

like dirt-under-feet, not only by ruffians but by”
neighbors, former friends, and sometimes even
one's very own flesh and blood as well? And this,
merely because one desired to worship as he chose.
So emigrate one must, if only to assuage one's
pride; but mostly to find peace and security for
oneself and family among people of good will. Even
though the mortality rate of some of the companies
crossing to Zion was high, particularly when the
dreaded disease of cholera attacked, that was a
chance one had to take, ''Zion'' was for the perse-
cuted, and the promise of it beckoned like a great
light to the Scandinavian Saints and thousands of
them decided to "follow the gleam" there.

By 1860 there were 4,416 members in that
northern mission; 1, 107 were new that year and
240 had gone over to Zion. In 1861 baptisms rose
to 1,954 and around 1, 000 emigrated; 1,977 souls
were baptised in 1862 and no less than 1, 556 in
four different companies left for the ''Valley of
the Mountains'', During 1863 new converts
totaled 1,587 and emigration was set at 1,458.
The branches and conferences of the LDS church
in Denmark, and her sister kingdoms, were being
impoverished by the emigration of these stalwart
members, while the little kingdom of Denmark was
being drained of some of her finest blood.

In the beginning of 1864 war, which had been
threatening for some time between Denmark on
one side and Prussia and Austria on the other,
broke out and on Feb, Ist the armies of those two
powerful German States crossed the Danish border
into Jutland and the war was on over the age-old
controversy about Slesvig and Holstein. It was
an unhappy experience for the Saints in Jutland
and elsewhere in Denmark too. Among the Danish
brethren subject to military duty were a number of
young LDS missionaries who were immediately
forced to take up arms in the fight; a few, however,
were able to hurriedly emigrate before they were
drafted. Thus many of the best native Elders
were torn from their fields of labor and the work
of the few others who remained was suspended in
some measure, In the Island of Fyen (Funen) the
American missionaries had a hard time because
<span id="page-??"></span>
57 Emigration

Danish troops stationed there took them prisoners,
tried them as spies and imprisoned them for a
time. The retreating Danish forces, fleeing
through Justland in May 1864, and the victorious
Prussians who followed them, caused havoc and
all kinds of trouble for the few missionaries who
remained there. They overran the whole Jutlandic
peninsula, some even going north as far as Skagen
(Jutland's nose), In Aalborg the German troops
took possession of the Saints' meeting hall, thus
preventing the holding of meetings in the area,

The increase in Church membership in Denmark,
understandably, was not as great that year, nor
was emigration; but in Sweden and Norway both
proceeded about as usual. However, the deter-
mination to ''go up to Zion'! was just as great, for
emigration was a goal becoming more and more
desirable to the Scandinavian members, In re-
porting on the mission at the close of that year,
President Carl Widerburg wrote: ''The spirit of
gathering is great among the Saints, and those
who can are preparing to emigrate next season,
Would we had means enough to emigrate the poor,
honest and faithful souls who are struggling here
in poverty, hardly able to support themselves, —
work being scarce and wages low."

There was war going on in the United States
of America then too, It was a bloody Civil War in
which her President, Abraham Lincoln, sought to
preserve the Union as well as set the black slaves
of the country free, While Denmark's war then
only lasted about six months, America's lasted
well over three years and was still going on in the
early part of 1865. Since things there were so
unsettled, prices so high and things in general
in more or less confusion, the church authorities
in Utah decided not to send wagon trains east that
year; so only those who could afford to outfit
themselves for the plains crossing were advised
to emigrate. One company of Saints, numbering
557, left Copenhagen 4th May that year however,
bound for Zion; and with the exception of one
single days storm the weather was most fair and
favorable during its entire voyage. But this was
<span id="page-??"></span>
Emigration 58

not always the condition of things on board; for
beside the Scandinavian Saints, a number of other
emigrants crossed the Atlantic on that trip. Elder
Christoffer J. Kempe wrote of this:--''While peace
and good will reigned among the Saints, the others,
who were Lutherans, Baptists and Methodists, lived
more like cats and dogs together; some had disputes
and engaged in fights, others played cards and
swore, while some preached; altogether there was
real pandemonium,'! Three adults died on the way
and twenty-five children succumbed from measles
and scarlet fever, One day a fire started on board
and created quite a panic before it was doused,
Meeting a ship coming from America, the west-
going emigrants were informed that the Civil War
there was over and the Union had won, All were
ordered on deck where they gave many rousing
cheers for the Red, White and Blue! It took this
company of emigrants 190 days to complete their
journey to Zion; namely, 42 days from Copenhagen
to New York, 12 days from New York to Wyoming,
Nebraska, 36 days preparing for the journey across
the plains (since no church wagons awaited them),
and 100 days travel from Wyoming to Salt Lake
City. The journey across the plains was not with-
out danger as the Indians were on the warpath and
the ''Black Hawk War'' was raging in the state of
Deseret (Utah), At Fort Laramie this company,

in 45 ox-drawn wagons, was halted and warned by
U. S. officers there not to go any farther west
because of the hostility of the Indians. Free pass-
age was offered to them to any other part of the
United States they wished to go. A meeting of the
Saints was called where the brethren decided to
reject this offer and take their chances on reaching
Zion; so they went on, Elder Peter A. Nielsen,
one of these 1865 emigrants, gave this account of
what followed: "About three days out from Laramie
(at a place called Wood Hollow, where we camped
for noon), while the men were driving the teams to
a watering place about three quarters of a mile
from camp, about a dozen and a half well armed
Indians sprang from their ambush in the woods

and tried to drive off our oxen, We opened fire
and this frightened the oxen and they ran back to
camp, but seven of the brethren were badly

wounded. John Swenson had two arrows in his left
arm and Peter ''Doctor' had one in his cheek and
one clear through his neck. A Swedish brother
came into camp with an arrow in the small of-his
back and was not able to walk again on the journey.
All we could do to relieve the sufferers was to let
them sit down on a wagon hub with their backs
against the spokes while we, using as surgical
instruments common blacksmith's pincers or
nippers, extracted the arrows from all except
Peter "Doctor", The arrow in his neck could not
be moved until we found a pair of extra long-
handled pincers, Then, laying the man upon the
‘ground with his head resting upon an ox-yoke, two
men sat upon him while another, with one strong
jerk, pulled the arrow out. Brother Holmgreen
was shot by a bullet and taken up for dead, but
recovered, A man by the name of Andersen was
shot by a bullet, which took off a bit of his cheek
and a chunk of his nose, Brother Frederick
Gruntvig came into camp with an arrow fastened
into his right hip; his wife had been carried off by
the Indians and no more has been seen of her," ©

_ Snow overtook these weary people before
they reached their destination the fore part of.
November. Had they not been helped in at last
by relief mule-teams and provisions they might _
never have made it. Emigrating, even at its best,
was no easy matter; but the Scandinavian emigra-
tion kept up. . a oe

the Atlantic by steamships, but the.cost proved
so high that sailing ships were again, pressed into,
service for awhile, On 10th May 1869 the railroad
reached Utah and the days of sailing-ship and ox-
team travel were ended for LDS emigrants, The
journey then, by steamship and railroad, could be
made from Denmark to New York in 13 days and
on west to Utah in another 14, From Copenhagen
to Utah in 27 days was quite a feat, considering
that it sometimes took all of six months the old

way. The Saints jogged along in fine style on those
early railroad trains at between 12 to 15 miles per
hour, Omaha to San Francisco was $40.00 by
train, "emigrant class", These emigrant cars
were usually attached to freight trains, Yes,
emigration was like magic when one traveled in a
modern all-the-way-to-Zion-in-comfort company!

By the end of that century some 30, 000
Scandinavian Saints had migrated to the Rocky
Mountains, and they continued to ''cross over",
hardy people of high character and dependability
with splendid reserve power, By far the majority
of these were from the little kingdom of Denmark,

It is a somewhat startling fact that just one hundred
years after the flame of the Gospel was first
kindled along the shores of the North Sea, 45% of
the total membership of the Latter-day Saint Church
was made up of Scandinavians and their descendants,
These plucky, sturdy people have been adding their
strength to this church now for the last one hundred
and eighteen years; strength of numbers yes, but
strength of character and works as well, No other
strain or race has contributed more to the upbuild-
ing of the great western section of the United States
than the Danish and their fellow northlanders.

God has led a chosen people out of many
'"Babylons" by the mouths of his Prophets, Exodus
in the Bible, one of our earliest accounts ofa
religious migration, tells how the children of
Israel wandered with Moses for 40 years in the
wilderness before they reached their ''Promised
Land'', The Book of Mormon gives a history of
the migration of another favored people who sailed
with Father Lehi across the great Pacific to distant
shores, seen by him in vision. The Puritans and
Pilgrims of the 1620s traveled in ships like the
Mayflower, to the rock-bound coasts of New Eng-
land to escape religious persecutions; and the
Mormon Pioneers of 1847, vanguards of thousands
who followed, crossed the great American plains
in search of a place where they too might worship
in freedom. The massive emigration of Scandin-
avian Saints who traveled equally long distances,
both by land and sea, to join the pioneers in Zion,
is just as great a movement as any of these. When
<span id="page-??"></span>

the departing Danes took a long, last look at the
"Lovely Land" and sailed away, they were leaving
behind the country that had cradled their kinfolk
for a thousand years and the forces which had
woven each everlasting fibre into the tapestry of
their very beings. They crossed more than an
ocean and a continent when they said goodby to
Jutland and her world of green islands; they
crossed latitudes of blood and longitudes of the
mind, Things would never be the same for them
again as they turned their faces west and set
sail toward their ''Promised Land",

"The only conclusive evidence of a man's
Sincerity is that he gives himself for a principal.
Words, money, all else are comparatively easy to
give away; but when a man makes a gift of his daily
life and practices it is plain that in that truth, what-

The mind does strange things in the quiet of
the night, It is as if I were not here in Utah's Zion,
writing, this February 1969 but in the small village
of Kjallerup in northwestern Jutland, Denmark, one
hundred and twenty-two years ago. , . . Autumn
..» « » Summer... . Spring. ... the seasons
and the years roll back and the breath of another
winter comes over the North Sea licking its hoar-
frost and spreading snow over the land like an
ermine blanket to shroud the death of summer,

It is the forepart of February 1847, Days are
shortened and folks lean forward over the work
in their hands, Lanterns are hung in the barns
for both milkings and women run errands with
their shawls clutched over their heads. The wind
howls and the bitterness of ice is in the air, The
mail coach comes but seldom now, but when it
comes it comes with a great stir, horn a-blowing
and bells a-jangling through the snowy dusk, as
hoofs of horses clatter on the frozen ground.

In the warm thatched cottage of Anders, son
of Christen, things are ina hustle. Bedstem¢éder
Karen is trying to hush and settle the little ones,

hurrying to pull on his great boots as his wife

Mette, from her couch, face wreathed in pain,
urges him to be gone, It's a harsh night to be out
in but he must hitch the wagon and fetch the mid-
wife. Donning his sheepskin coat he chides eight
year old Christen - ''Now mind the log fire for
your Mor'', and as Mette cries out again, adds
quickly: 'Ja, Ja - Igo now". Pulling his fur cap
low he turns to the door, bracing himself for the
weather outside. He hopes this baby will be an-
other boy - aman can use sons ona farm.

Anders himself had been born in this small
farming village of Kjallerup forty years ago come
April, and had lived on this very farm as long as
he could remember. His father, Christen Chris-
tensen, had come from the town of Vestervig south
and his mother, Karen Andersdatter, from the
village of Jannerup north, some years before his
birth and settled here midway between the two
places and raised their family. Five children had
blessed their union in Kjallerup. Anders' older
sister, Inger Cathrine, now Fru Peder Larsen of
Hvidbjerg, and his two younger brothers, Niels
and Niels Christian, were still about, but he could
hardly remember his baby sister, Ane Kirstine,
who had died at less than two months of age some
thirty-seven years ago, Anders' mind went back
as he rode through the February cold towards the
midwife's cottage. When his father had become
old and unable to look after the farm, he himself
being the oldest son had taken over and. looked. _
after things and his parents as well. When the
aged man passed on when nearing 78 years, 13
Feb. 1838, he had continued to live there on the
farm and care for it and his mother, The two of
them had lived there alone until she kept at him
to find himself a wife, which was no easy matter.
for a hard to please ''ungkarl'"' (bachelor) like
himself, But then he had found the comely Mette,
whose parents lived in the small farming village ©
of Svindborg, Orum Parish, southwest a few miles
from Kjallerup. —

Anders thought of their marriage, 5 Dec..
1843, which took place at Hvidbjerg, Vestes Aa
Kirke (Hvidbjerg Parish Church of the West)
Thisted Amt, Denmark, not.far from their home
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kjallerup 64

in Kjallerup. The Priest who performed the cere-
mony also recorded it in the Parish Church
records, putting Anders down as ''Brudgommen -
Ungkarl og girdmand, 36 ar gammel" (Bridegroom -
bachelor, farmer, 36 years of age) and putting
Metta down as ''Bruden Pige, 32 ar gammel!'!
(Bride - an unwed maid, 32 years of age), Anders
also remembered that when Mette had come to live
with him and his seventy year old mother Karen
she had brought her young son Christen with her.
The child was then nearly four years old, having
been born to Mette out of wedlock, 14 Mar. 1839,
at Lyngholm Mark, Hvidbjerg Parish.

Mette herself had been born 3 Apr. 1811 in
the village of Svindborg, Orum Parish, Denmark,
the daughter of ''girdmand Christen Hviid og fru of
Svindborg', (farmer Christen Hviid and wife of
Svindborg). Little was known, apparently, of her
mother, Else Andersdatter, except that she had
given her husband seven children, three sons and
four daughters, Mette herself being the youngest
of these. On the other hand much more was known
of her father, Christen Jensen Hviid (Hviid mean-
ing White in English), he having descended way
back from a Danish nobleman family - of which he
never forgot to be proud. Some people are like
that and carry the importance of their forebearers
to the point that they set themselves above speaking
to common folk and hold themselves aloof, though
they themselves are practically nothing. Not that
Mette and her parents and kinfolk weren't fine
people - on the contrary; yet Mette, like her
father, was perhaps overly proud of her heritage
and was often "lifted high'' by the nobility in her
blood, At times she seemed to feel it more than
others, thought Anders, and then she'd put on airs -
but after all!

Anders had learned to live with this although
he himself took little stock in such things, His
own progenitors had been simple country Danes,
Jutlandic peasants living there in Thy at least as
far back as the time when Christian IV took over
the Danish about the end of the sixteenth century.

- There was a record of his direct line at least that

far back but his. kin were certain that their
<span id="page-??"></span>
65 Kjallerup

ancestors had even been there on the peninsula

at the time of the Vikings and before, fighting

away to keep their lands and freedoms on this
fringe of northwestern Jutland. Anders had no
complaint with life, Hadn't Mette given hima
daughter right away and then a son of his own?

Two fine children in three years and now a third
was on its way. This thought brought him back to
the present with a start. How his mind had skipped
around and busied itself as he had jogged along, his
breath frosty on the air, forgetting the cold in the
warmth of his memories,

He hurries the horses, There is no time for
thinking his own thoughts once the chatty midwife
has bundled herself into the wagon beside him, or
back at the cottage either where Mette lies crying
out in pain. Had it not been so biting cold Anders
would have stayed outside with the livestock and
left the women to it, As it is, however, he
brings in more logs and feeds the fire since young
Christen, despite his chiding, has let it grow low
and gone off to sleep, That boy is poor to heed!
Anders replenishes the kettle and gets the water
to boiling, for use of the midwife, and then turns
his hands to odds and ends of other small tasks
while he waits patiently for a glimpse of his
second own son. But it was not a son but a
healthy baby daughter that Mette presents to
Anders on that 9th day of February 1847 in their
thatched cottage in Kjallerup, Thisted, Den-
mark, ....

The scene in Kjallerup fades and Iam back
at my writing here in Provo, Utah this February
of 1969, thankful for the warmth of my gas heated
home with its electric lights and hot and cold
running water, as well as all the other comforts
afforded me in this day and age, Rather regret-
fully my mind comes back to now for there is
work to do here, Before me on the table are
many written details pertaining to the lives of our
Danish progenitors - notes, journals, old letters,
maps - jottings from the memories of their child-
ren and grandchildren assembled and sorted long
after the events they describe are one with the
years, I pick up some of these and read them

over - yes, these I must include in this history,
but where and how? Yet I cannot keep my thoughts
from returning to the area of Jutland, Denmark and
the Danish peasants who lived and loved and walked
the earth there so many years ago, And I knowl
must go back there, as imagination dictates, and
follow this newly born baby girl and her associates
throughout the remainder of her life and tell her
story as I see it; for she is my Danish grandmother
and very precious to me indeed!

That they should name this second daughter
of theirs for Mette's mother, Else, was natural
since their first girl had been named for Anders'
mother, Karen, who lived there with them. Anders
may have thought that she should have the name of
his only living sister, Inger Cathrine, also, since
Danes often gave their children a whole string of
names, Mette probably objected to Inger but con-
sented to add the Cathrine - so Else Cathrine was
the name agreed upon. The Lutheran or State
Church to which they belonged prescribed that a
first sprinkling could be done in the home as soon
after a birth as possible lest the child ''die
uncleansed and be damned forever'', This home
baptism could be done by any male if the Priest
were not on hand, such as the landlord, gardner,
etc,, or even by the father himself, Then as soon
thereafter as could be arranged, weather per-
mitting, the family needs must travel to the Parish
church to register the birth and ''Hjemmendobt"'
(home baptism) of the infant, show it off as evidence
to the congregation, have the whole affair officially
recorded by the Priest and likely pay him a goodly
fee in the bargain for his trouble in taking care of
the 'Fremstillingen i Kirken" (official recognition
in the church).

Baby Else's home baptism was taken care of
the very day after her birth but it was not until 14
Mar. 1847 that the members of her family, attired
in their best, drove with her in the wagon a mile-
and-a-bit down the country road to the Parish
church in the neighboring village of Hvidbjerg and
had her naming and sprinkling duly acclaimed and
recorded by the Lutheran Priest there, A copy of

It was bitter weather also < on ‘the we stern
American frontier that February 1847. In the
territory of Nebraska at a place known as Winter
Quarters, which was situated on the west bank of.
the Missouri River opposite Kane sville, lowa,
were gathered some 3, 500 peculiar people calling
themselves "Latter-day Saints", popularly referred
to as ''Mormons", Poorly sheltered from the
weather in hurridly built log or sod houses, they
were the vanguards of some 20,000 ''Saints'' who
had been much persecuted and driven from their
comfortable homes. In the bleak cold of the pre-
vious winter, these Mormons had crossed the ice-
bound Mississippi in a body and traveled north-
westerly across Iowa in a continuous procession,
carrying along with them, in mournful wagon trains,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kjallerup 68

their sick and dying, wounded, lame and blind, and
tarrying in various small settlements along the way.
At the top of every hill they stopped and looked back
towards their once proud city of Nauvoo with its
beautiful temple. The ''Saints'' had been so driven
from many fair cities and cozy homes:--from Ohio -
to Missouri - to Illinois - to Iowa in few more than
a dozen years. Cruel mobs who had threatened and
driven them from their last abodes were now the
owners of their beautiful city and the smiling
countryside around. These were the mobs who had
_stopped their ploughs, silenced their hammers,
their axes, who had put out their fires, eaten their
food for which they now hungered, spoiled their
orchards, and trampled underfoot their thousands
of acres of unharvested grain; these were now the
keepers of their comfortable homes and the
carousers in their holy temple, whose drunken
riots insulted the ears and polluted the very air
there. The last company of the driven Saints, the
old, unable and destitute, or the remnants of the
people, who it was hoped could stay on there
unmolested until wagons returned to take them,
turned, when on the opposite shore, and beheld a
sight sorrowful to their eyes indeed; they saw all
the struggles, sweat, toil, dreams and sacrifices
of the past six years go up in flames; for lastly,
the mobsters burned their glorious Nauvoo temple.
So here in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, the van-
guard of these once-again homeless people were
camped that winter of 1847; there were many
widows and sick among them and burials were
frequent. All were poor in earthly goods, but the
poorer were helped by the better off. Come Spring
they intended to move on west across the great
American plains in search of anew home. Though
they had lost their great Prophet, their city, their
temple and their homes, and were shivering and
hungry in temporary shelters in Indian territory,

it seemed they could not be defeated in their pur-
poses; for they still had their God, and through
their trust in him they rose above every discour-
agement,

At the same time, Christian VIII was King
in Denmark; it was the last full year of his reign.
The country was making brave effort to get on its
<span id="page-??"></span>

‘feet again after having lost its ponderous navy.
The peasants were making agricultural progress
but behind the atmosphere of modest demands and
thriftiness there was a sort of paralyzing bitter-
ness, The Danish people, it appeared, could not
fully get over the grave shocks and losses their
country had suffered, despite the white sails that
could once more be seen tacking in and out between
the five hundred green islands, Even so, as often
during periods of discouragement and reflection,
new ideas, evaluations, and intellectual movements
were dawning there too, It was during this time
that Denmarks' great writer of fairy tales, Hans
Christian Andersen, wandered around the streets
of his homeland and wrote the stories that were to
gain him world renown. It was then and there that
Soren Kierkegaard, the theological philosopher,
and Grundtvig, the spiritual revivalist, both
strolled and thought, and here that Adam Ochlen-
schlager, Denmark's national poet, both lived and
wrote, Yes, writers wrote and people read, but
no matter how idyllic everything appeared, in the
old Danes' hearts was still the memory of how
things had been before, Sarcastic criticism of the
old autocratic system of government, which it was
felt was responsible for the catastrophe, could be
heard in many circles, and even some youths in-
the Capitol enthusiastically demonstrated for
"liberty". Too, there was a growing spirit of:
"German nationalism" in the Danish provinces
of Holstein and South Slesvig, which the Danish
people in general viewed with concern; but which
no one seemed able to do much about, leastwise
King Christian VIII, The restlessness there was
obviously becoming more critical by the hour
when this melancholic, disappointed King died
and his son, Frederick VII, became the country's
Absolute Monarch.

But this new king, who took over in 1848,
was neither loved nor admired; there was much.
gossip about him in the Kingdom, since "he had

“already wrecked two marriages, and was vague
and moody and not even considered reliable. . ."'
So the Danes decided this was the time to do some-
thing about a few things! A number of leading citi-
zens formed a delegation and called upon
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kjallerup 70

Frederick VII and suggested to him that the Danish
people were somewhat ''fed up'' and were pretty
well set on having more say in matters of State.
Now Danes are apt to call a spade a spade or an
axe an axe any day; they seldom beat-around-the-
bush or mince words, even with Kings; so it is
supposed that they more or less demanded a new
form of government and struck a blow for ''free-
dom" then and there. At least the new King must
have known what they meant, for he acquiesced,
and Absolute Monarchy toppled in Denmark that
year of 1848. A number of meetings were held

in the Capitol and a "constituent assembly"
gathered in order to draw up the plans for a new
constitutional democracy. Almost at the same
time, however, the uprising that had been simmer-
ing for some time down in the province of Holstein
came to a full boil! A certain member of German
royalty took advantage of things and informed the
people down there that the citizens of Copenhagen
had risen in rebellion and were threatening the
King. The Holsteiners were not interested in the
freedom of the country but only in their own. So,
while the King was engaged in other business, they
considered this a good time to pull out. Thus the
Prince of Noer was able to assume power in the
south and gathered a revolutionary army composed
of Holsteiners and volunteers who streamed in
from other German States to help, They said, if
not in so many words, ''Now we Holsteiners are
leaving you, Denmark, and going over to Germany
where our sympathies are, and we're going to take
the whole of Slesvig with us!'' And the Danes
apparently believed them and went to war to save
Slesvig. The first battles were won by the Danish,
but when Prussia came in against them Denmark
was terribly upset. The war lasted three years
but there was only fighting during the summer;
every time the sun came out the battles started
again. Finally Prussia withdrew and the Hol-
steiners retreated and the Danes were victorious,
The end came 25 July 1850 and Slesvig and Hol-
stein remained with Denmark, During the course
of the war the ''Constituent Assembly'' had com-
pleted its work and on 5 June 1849 the new
constitution was signed. Many Danes began

scratching their heads and talking over this and
that, since all men thirty or past could now vote
and had a greater say in matters,

But the child Else knew naught of these
things; she was growing happily and healthily
under the loving care of Mor Mette and the proud,
watchful eyes of Far Anders, Truly she was after
their hearts! Before her second spring it was well
known in this Danish household that still another
child was on the way; and the father ploughed and
sowed and dreamed of many sons. The golden har-
vest was over and the threshing nearly done when,
on the 12th of Oct. 1848, another daughter came
to that home on the farm in Kjallerup. They named
this one Ane, after Ander's dead sister, with her
second name Kirstine, the same as Mette's, but
they always called her ''Stine'', She was the fairest
of little ones but less robust than the others, Now
Anders loved his children, but mayhaps he con-
sidered a majority of females on a farm a poor
arrangement. Possibly he mentioned to his wife
that henceforth they should sleep with an axe under
_ their bed; the old Scandinavians wagered this was
a sure way to get a boy. But whether or not he
did, or they did, nothing came of it; for on 23 Jan.
1850 another daughter arrived at their cottage,
She was tiny and sickly, so they had her sprinkling
right away and gave her the name of Edel Marie .
Andersen. She died a day past three weeks, 14
Feb. 1850. (Did Anders feel this to be a punish-
ment for his undue yearnings for a son?) Later,
on a bitter winter day, they took the little corpse
to the churchyard at Hvidbjerg to be buried, and
the Priest recorded her birth, christening and
death at one and the same time. If Else knew of
her wee Sister's passing she soon forgot; for
though she was extremely apt and quick to learn
she was, after all, only just past three when they
laid Edel in her grave.

As Else grew older there were short trips
in the wagon to think of; especially did she enjoy
going to church on Sundays at Hvidbjerg, in her
best frock, starched petticoats and cap (one always
wore the head covered in church) and little high-
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kjallerup 72

buttoned shoes over hand-knit stockings, always
black, The church was cold and dark inside, both
summer and winter, even with candles burning; but
the walls and ceilings were bright with pictures of
Saints and Angels and garlands of leaves and
flowers, if one could see, The Priest (or Pastor)
in his dark long full robes, with a white ruff at his
chin and a great cross hanging at his back, stood
up in front and drolled out the long prayers and
sermons, which were seldom if ever understood,
There was somebody pumping the organ as it was
being played for hymns, (When she was confirmed
she could have her very own hymn book with her
name on.) On the outside there was. the white
church with the cross on top and the big bell
ringing in the tower, the Priest's house or Parson-
age, and the garden of white tombs, some with
little stone-lambs, where Edel lay;-- Ja, these
she would never forget! Sometimes the family
went to Oveso (Ove Lake); they could walk there
since it was less than a half mile east and a bit
north of their cottage. One of the largest lakes

in Thisted Amt, it ran diagonally from southeast
to northwest a distance of about five miles through
the very center of the county. There it lay, glitter-
ing in a frame of beech woods, where starlings
made choirs in the trees, and sometimes one saw
a great stork fly up. In summers, fishing boats
with white sails were always drifting there, and
Far Anders often fished there; but usually it was

a family festival that took the rest of them to the
water.

In the day-dark of winter, month after month,
when even the old Danes sometimes wondered if
spring would ever come, the lake was usually
frozen over, The winters in Jutland seemed weary
and long, especially to one as active and eager as
Else. They were always so damp and cold, with
much fog; snow piled higher than a child could see
over, and frost biting nose and fingers, Then
there was always the chill of the rough wind which
came streaking across from the North Sea, The
Andersens lived only about three miles in from
that restless treacherous sea; sometimes they
could hear it moan, as its waves crashed and broke
upon the shore to the west. But still, in winters
<span id="page-??"></span>
73 Kjallerup

there were lessons to be had, for Mette was deter-
mined that her children were to be well-taught, as
befitted descendants of noblemen!) Young Christen,
of course, had been attending school at the Church
school since he was eight, for this had been the’
law of.the land since Anders and Mette were’ child-
-ren.. But he was not always at Kjallerup, ‘for
sometimes he went to live with Mette's mother,
bedstem¢der Else, in-Orum Parish, for she had -
raised him.when he was small and he was at home
there, The four:younger children had wonderful -
times together playing the learning games Mette .
had for them. Else-liked best the one where you
held up your hand and crooked each finger in turn,
while repeating, ''Tommeltot (the thumb), Slikke-
pot (pointer) Langemand (middie finger) Guldbrand
{ring finger) and Lille Peder Spillemand (little .
finger).'' So, old Guldbrand got to wear the rings!
Mette told her children that many important Danish-
men in the big cities, and even on the better farms,
wore rings on several fingers, and high silk hats,
coats with polished buttons, and embroidered waist-
coats, while their womenfolk wore flowered bonnets
and.elegant shawls. Someday, if they worked and
studied hard, they too would be important! |

_In spring the wind went on and on, never
seeming to run out of breath, like an old gossip;
which was perhaps necessary, in the case of the
wind, especially in Jutland, to dry up the land so
farmers could start their ploughing. But very
early in the spring of 1852, when the trees were
still twiggy before the leaves came, Anders didn't
start his ploughing, as he was wont, but went
instead to the police in the nearest place to
Kjallerup, where they were, to secure authorized
government permission to move his: family'else-
where, ‘This was the Danish law then... Each adult
Dane possessed a "little Black Book'!'which had to
be officially marked, or stamped, when consént ©
was given for a change of residence, and rechecked
when residence was taken up in another place, In

this manner the Kingdom kept track of her people
as they moved around; especially the men of mili-

» tary age, who had much difficulty in changing their

areas of abode. Anders wished to sell the farm. in
Kjallerup, no doubt, and had perhaps found a good
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kjallerup 74

buyer. He planned to move his family north a few
miles to the somewhat larger town of Norhaa,
closer to the place where his mother was born

and where a number of her kinsfolk dwelt. The
old Karen was longing to be nearer her own people.
Whether the lack of more sons to help on the farm
had anything to do with this is hard to tell, or per-
haps Mette had visions of a finer cottage in which
to raise her children and give birth to her next
child, which was expected. Permission to move
was granted and what a hustle and bustle and pack-
ing of things there must have been. Goodbys had
to be said to neighbors and friends, and Mette's
people in the Parish south had to be visited. Cer-
tainly they must have gone for the blessing of the
Priest upon their move and his recommendation to
their new Parish; and did they not stop to shed a
tear beside Edel's little mound?

When the wagon was loaded to the hilt they
set out west a quarter of a mile and then turned
onto the wagon road leading northeast a couple of
miles to the village of Istrup, and from thence
around the west tip of Oveso, then skirting the
small village of Legind they followed the muddy
wagon road northwest another two miles until it
joined with the main traveled road at Freskilde,
where they turned and followed this new road west
another mile-and-a-bit to Norhaa, where the
church could be seen all shining white there.

2. NORHAA .. , 1852-1862

The Priest in the Parish and town of Norhaa
welcomed farmer Anders Christensen and his family
and entered them on the records, 29 March 1852,
in the following Danish words: Familien er 29 Marts
1852 flyttet til Norhaa Sogn. Her er naevnt:
Girdmand Anders Christensen 43 ar.gl., hans Kone
Mette Kristine Christensdatter 40 ar.gl., Aftagts-
kone Karen Andersdatter 78 ar.gl. Deres born:
Karen Andersen 8 ar.gl., Mads Christian Andersen
7 ar.gl., Else Cathrine Andersen 5 ar.gl., Ane
Kirstine Andersen 3 ar.gl. So Else's family moved
to a better farm in Norhaa when she was just a
month and three weeks past five, Her sister Karen
<span id="page-??"></span>
75 Norhaa

had just turned eight the 18th of March that year
and Mads had his seventh festival just ten days
before, on the 19th of March, the day after Karen's
birthday. Their old grandmother Karen, now 78,
was with them but their half-brother Christen was
not. He perhaps remained in Kjallerup working
for someone, since he was then just turned 13, or
he may have been with Mette's parents down in
Svindborg. Anders had come to their new farm
before the planting season was over, so he would
plough after all that spring; and Mette was in her
nicer cottage in plenty of good time to welcome
the new baby there in Norhaa, 22 Aug. 1852. And
guess what -- it was a bouncing, plump baby girl
whom they christened Sidsel Marie and called
Marie. Her hjemmedobt (home baptism) was
recorded as 24 Aug. 1852 and her fremstillingen
i Kirken (recognition of the same in the church)
10 Oct. 1852, all in their new Parish church in
Norhaa.

Young Karen, dark haired and small of
stature, started school for the first time the late
fall of 1852, in the schoolhouse close to the white
church at Norhaa, for she was now eight years old.
The young students who went clogging along in their
wooden shoes through mud and snow, removed them
upon entering the school room and placed them in
individual cubby-holes, assigned to each for that
purpose, before donning soft handmade slippers
instead, The school classes in these farming towns
and villages usually lasted for about six months

each year, from after-harvest in October to before-
planting in April; children were needed on the farms
between times. One teacher for each two grades
was the general rule, with a supervisor, anda
sort of school council or board made up of citizens,
Of course the Parish Priest was the general super-
visor, over all, and often looked.in and listened in
at the school, questioning the pupils, especially
at examination times, Here in these free Church
and State schools young Danes learned to read and
write and were tutored in the literature, history
and geography of their own land. Girls were
instructed in the home-making arts and learned
to hand-sew, embroider, knit and crochet; while
boys were given training in agriculture, care of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Norhaa 76

farm animals, etc., and also sports competition.
The Danes in general were great admirers of ath-
letic ability and both boys and girls were given _
gymnastic training. Religious study was had too,
and catechisms were a regular part of the school
program, Each Danish child was to attend school
until age 12 or 14 unless circumstances dictated
otherwise, which was sometimes the case among
the poorer peasant families, The winter nearest

to a child's fourteenth birthday (before or after) he
or she was sent twice a week, for the full six months,
to the Priest's house or Parsonage near the school,
to be taught the fundamentals of the Lutheran Church
by the Priest himself, This was in preparation for
his or her first communion and confirmation, These
important occasions were nearly always held at the
close of the school year in April and looked forward
to with great anticipation by every Danish child; for
after Confirmation one was considered to be an
"adult", as it were, and allowed adult privileges.
Young Christen had joined his mother's family in
time for school that fall, for he would be 14 the
following March and in line for confirmation in
April.

Olid Karen was feeble now and had taken to
her bed, but Mette cared for Ander's mother
tenderly, in spite of the new baby and all, This |
was an obligation willingly assumed by all upright
Danes; to care well for their aged progenitors and
show them love and give them thanks while there
yet remained the time for giving -- thanks for the
fact that through them they.themselves now lived
and knew the boundless joy there-was in living!
This one characteristic alone set the Danish above
people of many other lands; kinship and heredity
‘were sacred and important to them. January 26th
1853 old Karen passed on, she would have had her
80th festival in less than two more months, for she
was born 12 April 1773. Her grandchildren were
sad at the loss of dear Bedstemé¢der, for she was
kind to them and had been in the home from their
first memories, Anders was sorely grieved,
though perhaps it was better than a long suffering;
but he knew so little of what was held out for her
on the other side of the grave, Would he ever see
her again? He longed to take her corpse to the
<span id="page-??"></span>
77 Norhaa

Hvidbjerg churchyard to lay down by his father,

old Christen, but because of the winter weather
and bad roads it seemed impossible. So arrange-
ments were made with the Priest in the Parish
there at Norhaa for her funeral and proper burial
or "dirt casting'' (jordpakastelsen). The Priest
preached a good funeral sermon over the old one
as her casket lay in front of him near the pulpit

of the white church and then, as they carried her
coffin outside, the large bell in the belfry began

to toll for her and continued until her casket had
been lowered into the grave-hole. Then the Priest
took his place beside the hole and cast in a little of
the sacred dirt (which he had blessed) which made
a sad little thud upon the wooden casket down below
as he raised his hand to heaven with the words,
"From earth you came; to earth you return; and
from earth you shall come again -- Amen", and
this benediction was the signal for the plain dirt

to be shoveled into the gaping hole, while the black
clothed and hatted mourners stood weeping all
around, No sound could be happier than bells, yet
no sound could be sadder. And thus Karen Anders-
datter went to her rest and her reward, and it was
said by some that there was a hovering of all her
ancestors over the land then; for so it was believed
to be when one of the old Danes died.

Young Christen did receive his confirmation
at the Parish church in Norhaa that spring of 1853,
for so the record there proclaims, It is likely
that he received his Little Black Book (Skudsmaals-
bod) about the same time also, but it would be diffi-
cult for him to move around much anyway till he
was 39, because he was of military age now soon
and must be available if the King wanted him in his
army. He could give Anders some help on the new
farm. Young Mads started school that late autumn,
1853, He had been a great help to his father,
gathering and carrying in wood, and water from —
the well; taking the cows to the meadow pasture, .
with the aid of his little, yapping dog; feeding the
pigs and other farm animals; and with planting,
weeding and harvesting. One never had to worry
about watering the crops in Jutland for the "Great
<span id="page-??"></span>
Norhaa 78

Provider'' took care of that there, as he did else-
where in Denmark; the concern was for enough dry
days. God put the sun in the heavens, sent the rain
and provided the earth, but peasants had to plant
and sow - ja! Yes, evena child's ten fingers
could be a great help on a farm and in a house,

Else too was a fine, strong child witha
willingness to serve, She could gather eggs,
carry small pails of grain to feed chickens and
geese, bring in vegetables from the garden, pick
clean the wool her father sheared and her mother
corded for quilts or spun into yarn for knitting or
loom weaving, and numbers of other small tasks
both in and out the cottage, Mette sought her
second daughter's help often, because of her
cheerfulness and ability, for she herself was
crowded with work from early morning until after
nightfall. Else wondered at her mother's magic
touch with butter and cheese, red-mush, sweet-
soup, frikadeller, bed med log, little fried and
sugared apple cakes (ableskiver) Danish soup and
dumplings and Danish homemade beer, etc. Some-
day she herself would learn to cook like Mor, and
spin and weave and knit stockings of all sizes and
mittens, and make high feather beds. Right now
she liked to tend her baby sister most of all; when
the older children were in school she had Marie
mostly to herself and this pleased her and Mor too.
Marie was rolly-polly and slow to learn but Else
loved her just the same as she did her other young
Sister, Stine, who was so often sick in winter. In
truth, Else loved all her family, her kith and kin
and everybody, for she was a happy, generous,
loveable person, Though not as pretty as dainty
Karen or fragile Stine, or yet in fact as plump
Marie, still she was well put together and very
intelligent looking, with a high forehead, well
proportioned nose and other excellent features,
but she had the most beautiful hair of all! It fell
to her waist in heavy cascades the color of dark
burnished amber, as if it had been freshly dipped
in liquid Danish ''sea-gold", Many of their kins-
folk had 'red hair"; even Mads! and Stine's was
turned toward that shade; but Else's hair could not
be called red, or yet brown -- it was more the
color of shining ''Danish amber"', so let it go at
<span id="page-??"></span>

that! Mostly she wore her lovely tresses in two
full, round braids hanging down her back. When
she became confirmed she could wear them as she
chose; perhaps she would wind them into a braided
crown upon her head, like Mor's.

Most likely Else Cathrine started to school
the October before she was 8, as was often the
practice if parents desired it. Mette was espec-
ially concerned for the education of her children
and would most probably have seen to it. Else
herself must have been anxious and proud to clop
along to the schoolhouse in her wooden shoes that
winter of 1854/55; along with Karen and Mads.

As a caution against the cold she would have worn
besides, long hand knitted woolen stockings well
up over her knees, and a half-sleeved shimmy and
flannel-lined bloomers under a heavy, long-sleeved |
wool dress, with coat, cap, mittens and a shawl.
One had to bundle up in winters in Jutland. That
this child's interests in school ran to the reading,
writing and language skills and other ‘academic _
pursuits rather than to handicrafts, can be easily
imagined; although she must have learned all that
was necessary of the homemaking arts as well.
Karen was just the opposite; she liked the sewing
and other home arts best, while Mads was inclined
more like his younger sister; he wanted to become
ateacher. That Else gained favor with students,
teachers and the Priest because of her friendly,
eager and industrious nature is also easy to
believe. And who can doubt,.: having ‘known her,
but that she gathered friends and admirers, as
flowers, along the path which led to her woman-
hood - friends in whom she delighted !.

Christmastime was like a bright diamond

laid in the center of winter, No one went to

school then, Preparations began long before the
time, especially where the gathering of supplies
and cooking were concerned, The holiday itself
lasted twelve good days and everybody wanted to

be in on it, Even the shops were opened but half
days for part of the time only, since nobody wanted
to be spending time buying then - nej! There were
the Holy days and the half-Holy days; food in
<span id="page-??"></span>
Norhaa 80

abundance, presents, and much celebrating and
merriment all around, as well as worshiping in
the church, with many candles lit, There were
lanterns hung at every cottage door in welcome,
garlands of scented boughs hung round inside and
vines of potted house plants traveling over windows
and walls; with the Yule log set to burning on the
hearthstone, The eve before Christmas was the
happiest time of the whole Yuletide, but especially
for the young ones, At4 p.m. on Dec, 24th, all
businesses and shops closed in the villages and
everybody went home from there. Farm laborers
and house servants were sent home, if they had
homes; otherwise they gathered with the families
of their employers, Then came the big Yule feast
in every cottage, which had been made ready
beforehand. Roasted goose stuffed with apples

and prunes was the favorite, but duck or pork and
sausage might be had instead. There were always
potatoes, yellow-root (carrots) sweet-and-sour
red cabbage,. coffee, tea, beer and all; besides the
"rice mush" or pudding, with an almond hidden in
it - anyone getting the almond won a prize. A bowl
of this was always set out on the doorstep for the
Yule Missen (Christmas elves) who brought the
presents. Then there were platters of Danish
pastries and other goodies and a wonderful wreath-
cake, to remind one of the crown of thorns,

Afterwards there was the large Yule tree in
the very center of the biggest room, with every-
thing hung on it; strings and strings of small paper
flags, little bags of nuts, miniature cookies and
homemade candy of almond paste - one could
hardly name all that was put on. Then came
reading from the Holy Bible about the Christ Child
and the manger-crib, and children thought of all
the little lambs and friendly animals about, Next
came the circling of the tree, with all the family,
young and old, joining hands and singing Yuletide
hymns, Finally ali danced around the tree and
ended with a funny song for the little ones, and
that was the signal to break-hands, Then what a
cry went up until the cottage almost shook with
children's voices:--''Presents Mor - presents -
presents - where are the Yule Missen gifts?"

And Mor would hurry out and then bring in a big
<span id="page-??"></span>
81] Norhaa

bag of presents from the doorstep, where the
Christmas elves had left it, in place of the rice-
mush, There were always presents for everyone
in Ander's household, When the children were
small there were tops, dolls and little boxes
carved from wood and always a carved figure of
a ''Hvid Knight'' for Mads, Perhaps there was a
brooch carved from amber for Mor and a watch
chain woven from human hair for Far. As the
children added years there might be amber
brooches for the girls too, and beads and little
amber drops for their pierced ears, Then there
was always something to store away in each girl's
"brides-chest'', besides books for Else and the
others; for had they not hoped for the latest of
Hans Christian Andersen's tales?

From then until Twelfth Night each day had
its celebration, Christmas Day was the first
"Holy-day'' and everybody went to the church,
as they did on the following or second Holy-day.
Others were only half-Holy-days, and so on those
days Danes alternated between church, visiting
and entertaining. If the snow fell on and on,
slowly and steadily, folks didn't go very far but
kept to their own neighborhoods; but if the weather
permitted they usually visited at every farmhouse
for miles around, sharing in the festivals of all.
When company came, or even if it didn't, there
was celebrating enough to do at home; games to
be played and prizes for the winners, with Far,
smoking his big pipe, looking on, and dancing,
singing, joke-making and food again! Always
there were open-faced sandwiches and more
pastries with plenty of coffee, tea and beer to
wash them down; but better still, for Else at
least, were the clouds of fragrance from bowls
of Danish soup steaming between islands of
dumplings. For the full twelve days of Yuletide,
Danes ate and ate, then it was easy to forget the |
wind and cold outside; but the wonderful days of
Christmas one could never forget - Glaedlig Yul!
On Twelfth Night girls in their teens or even older
ones might well remember the old ritual old
Danes told about. They said if a maiden wished
to know whom she would marry, then on that
night, carrying a shoe in her right hand and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Norhaa 82

walking backwards to her bed, she should throw
the shoe over her left shoulder, saying at the
same time to the three Holy Kings in a whisper:

"Show me the very one
Whose bed I must spread
Whose name I must bear
Whose bride I must be,"'

Then the man of whom she dreamed that Twelfth
Night was her bridegroom-to-be; but if she lay
dreamless, a future spinster was she! Certainly
Mette's daughters at least thought of such things
as the piles in their brides-chests grew and grew.

It was easy to forget the harshness of winter
when days began to lengthen and the land came out
in holiday attire, In Jutland's countryside summer
was blue sky with patches of grey-blue and pure
white summer clouds over breathless silhouettes:
men at work in the fields; cattle grazing in meadows
of wild hay (a thousand years ago these same mea-
dows were navigable waterways haunted by sea
rovers); beautiful lakes and fjords and some gently
rolling hills in places; moorlands and dunes and
lovely sand beaches; large and small farms, stick
fences, windmills, white churches, gentle thatched
cottages, and goose-girls with their buckets of
grain; birds flying over the rooftops; and on the
coasts the flying shapes of ships - how could one
ever forget all these? In summers Else often
went with her father in the wagon or buggy, on
his various trips about the countryside. Anders
loved this capable and willing daughter and, next
to Mads, she was the apple of his eye. On such
occasions she jumped up at the first cockcrow and
was all goose-pimples at the thoughts of it; she
loved the outdoors and she adored being with her
father, Sometimes they'd stay out almost an
entire day. When she was young Far let her hold
the reins, but now she was almost to be confirmed
he taught her to handle the team and she ''spelled
him off'' with the driving - she had strong hands
and arms, Else had long since learned the gentle-
ness, yet firmness, with which horses were to be
used, for she sometimes rode horseback too, The

love of the countryside was in the blood of both
father and daughter, and as they drove along the
taste of salt was in the air and the smell of it in
their nostrils, They lived only a few meters, or
miles, due west from the seacoast, although they
had to pass over two or three miles of sand dunes
to get there.

The bracing, briny wind streaking across ©
Denmark came from the North Sea. It had sculp-
tured Jutland's west coastline with wonderful sand
dunes, The sea was always eating away at the land
and casting the chewed-up part back upon the coast
in the shape of shining white sand. And so the
coastline not far west from: Else's home was ©.
covered with miles and miles of restless waves
of sand, which, if not tied down with plantings,
would move in upon the people; since.the wind
was always there willing to carry them. In the
past, the high dunes had moved like an untamed —
sea of sand, wave upon wave; across the culti-
vated fields. Years ago a sandstorm had half
buried the old Skagen Church on Jutland's nose
and it had always been a hard battle to secure a _
few fishing ports along the we ‘st ‘coast, Though |
bathing beaches closely dotted many ‘parts of both
the east and west coasts of the peninsula, this was
not so along their coastal area; there were no good
bathing beaches close to them, | But the many
large and small 'pot-holes'! amo ng: the high dunes
of sand nearby made fine places to picnic away
from sun and wind, For vacationers, wishing a.
tan, there was no better place on earth than these
sunbaked dunes; here they too could get sunbaked
and somewhat salt- cured as. well,

~ Now the Danish government was talking
about planting forests all along Jutland's west ©:
coastline, inland a few miles between the dunes =:
and the mainland, Another of the farmers enemies,
Far said, was the heathland with its:accompanying
heather, which also grabbed away at the land: It:
had already started spreading like a blanket over
the old peasant settlements of Denmark. Large
stretches of this were to be broken up, the soil
cleared and crops sown; this: would shrink the
moors of Jutland and give the farmers back some
<span id="page-??"></span>
Norhaa 84

of their good land. A start was to be made also
on drying up the bogs all over the country, as
well as the marshlands, and damming up shallow
bays and inlets so that large areas of land could
be reclaimed; this was good, Ja!

The waves of the North Sea itself were
rough and dangerous, There was little peace on
the water there, That very year (1860) during a
fierce storm 14 ships had run aground, all within
a comparatively short stretch of Jutland's coast-
line; and Far recalled the old Danes talking about
the biggest wreck in the history of the west coast
of Jutland, It happened on Christmas night of the
very year Mor was born (1811) during the war
against England, when the H.M.S. "St, George"
and H.M.S. ''Defense'! were cast upon the sand-
bars, Of the combined crews of the two ships
only 11 men were saved - 1,600 were drowned,
To Else, the sea was nothing - let the fish have
it; it was the land she loved!

When they stopped to pass the time of day
over the fences by the neighboring farms, the
talking was of other, more pertinent things:

"The Holsteiners are at it again, still threatening
to take away Slesvig and just looking for an
excuse! - ''There's a dirty lot praying with their
hats off; criticizing the State Church right on the
streets'' - 'Nej, Nej; we've trouble enough with
those Holsteiners without having religious fanatics
sent in'' - "If any of these Mormon preachers come
within sight or sound of our Parish 'twill be the
devil to pay - they'd better stay clear of our
daughters - - !'' Then one of the farmers looked
up and caught Else's eyes upon him and leaned
closer towards Anders and whispered something
she could not hear, crossing himself with one
hand while he shook his timber axe with the other,
and Anders swore a curse out loud and whispered
something back, Then the farmer continued on in
louder tones, ''They are in Aalborg now these past
ten years, but only the poor and ignorant peasants
there listen - -.'' And so the talk went on at every
farm in the same guttural voices, words spewed
out in harsh grunt-like sounds, as if the speakers
mouths were full of potatoes; for so they spoke in
<span id="page-??"></span>

all of Thyland; they had a special Danish of their
own, All seemed to work themselves up to
lathers as they spoke and Else wondered, as she
sat holding the reins, ''Was it then so bad?!''! She
had heard a bit of talk before about these people;
the Priest had mentioned them one day in school,
with much scorn, but she had thought not much of
it before, Anders said more of it as they drove
along home and though he was naturally a quiet-
spoken man, he was much exercised about these
so-called 'Mormons" and took it out on the unsus-
pecting horses; "If they ever come here ['ll - - -
'Crack' - - he brought his whip down on the inno-
cent beasts, and in the jolting and bumping that
followed, Else failed to hear what he planned to
do then, and she never found out until years later.

Else Cathrine Andersen's confirmation took
place the following April (1861) two months after
her fourteenth festival, It was a fine affair,
almost as wonderful as a wedding perhaps; and
she could say with all her heart that her parents
had spared nothing, for Mette certainly knew the
importance of the occasion and had seen to it that
her second daughter was fitted out for the splendid
affair in the very best manner they could afford,
She had a long white dress over full, stiffly .
starched underskirts, white stockings, white
linen buttoned shoes, white ribbon bows on her
two long amber braids, and a white embroidered
shawl for her shoulders afterwards, and a flowered
bonnet as well, Mors never forgot anything! There
was anew hymn book all her own with her own
name on it in gilt and a sweet little ''Dagmar
Cross" on a chain for her neck, Else had heard
that some peasants even mortgaged their farms
to give their daughters proper confirmations, and
perhaps encourage better marriages for them; but
Anders was happy to be able to afford these things
for Else, for he had prospered in Norhaa. Of all
his daughters, Else was the most liked, and even
the Priest had said it. He thought she had a future
in the schoolroom, should she so desire, and men-
tioned that he would be. pleased to recommend her,
Else thought she had never been happier or felt so

loved and blessed,

Several years before (1857) a law had been
made in Denmark requiring all present Danes to
change their surnames and take the same one as
their fathers, This meant that the Andersen
children should now go by the surname of Christen-
sen, as Anders did. But Danes were slow to change,
especially Jutlanders, and this had taken some
thinking about and in Thisted it was not too well
enforced, as yet, Young Christen had never gone
by the name Andersen, but Christensen, as he was
christened, so he had no problem. Mads, on the
other hand, decided on a big change and soon after
his confirmation began using the surname Hvid
(the modern spelling of Hviid, from his mother's
father's side). Mette must have been happy about
this, thinking that it gave her second son some dis-
tinction to be called by a nobleman's name - so
Mads Christian Hvid his name remained from that
time on. The Andersen sisters decided against
the surname change for the present, at least; it
would be time enough to change when they were
married! Else Cathrine however, a little bolder
than the rest and now fully confirmed, decided to
compromise and changed the spelling of her middle
name instead, from Cathrine, as she was christened,
to Kathrine, with a K, the more popular way then;
'twas something she had long kept in her mind,

The northern summer is almost like a para-
dise on earth, especially for one whose eyes are
open to the beauties of nature, so sublime and
grand, and whose ears are atune to the trills of
the skylark, the charming tones of the nightingale
and other singing birds. One cannot help but inhale
the invigorating summer breezes and enjoy the
aroma that flows from flora's bosom. And so it
was in Denmark, where the temperature varied
between 60-80°, The long, mild days, never too
hot, in which one could read a newspaper by day-
light up to 10 o'clock at night, were all too few for
Else. In midsummer there were frequently 15
hours of sunshine daily, and one could hear happy
children playing in the streets, having their hours
of romping often until nearly midnight. The parks
and city boulevards were filled with promenaders

until long after that and small groups of men and
womien could be seen chatting together, while
love-sick couples strolled hand in hand or seated
themselves on comfortable benches in the parks
or by cottage doors, The nights were short and
light, but somewhat cool. Ona clear night one
could sometimes catch a glimpse of the "Northern
Lights", Pleasure boats cruised on lakes and _
fjords and in bays and harbors and huge sailing
vessels, at half speed, glided in and out of the
larger water ways.

In Norhaa the Andersen girls often sat long
together on the bench outside-their doorstep, the
older ones doing handwork for their brides-chest,
while Mads squatted near by whittling away with a
knife. They joked, laughed and chatted and told
of their plans for the future, Karen was now
employed in an embroidery shop but hoped to
attend the Folk High School ‘the coming winter, to
learn more of fine sewing and to spin and weave.
Mads for sure would be a teacher, but first he
must do farm work and save his money, then he ©
too would attend High School in'winter, Else was
undecided, the restless current of Viking blood»:

more of the world. They had never been toa city
of any size at all, none of them, but only a few <.

picnics somewhere together, ‘What was it like in

died that past winter but they brought their séven
other children with them. The two older girls
were spinsters and sorry for it, but Ann Margrete

all his nieces no matter how big they had grown,

Friends from school and the neighboring
farm cottages came too, to sit, or walk and talk
with the Andersen youths, but there were few
young men among them. Mette had her eyes peeled
for marriageable males for her daughters; she had
four of them to worry about and Karen now was of
the age, and soon Else, Mor sometimes spoke of
marriage to them and dwelt on the importance of
being wed to someone from the better class; --
"for when you choose your life's mate'', she coun-
seled, "it is the whole future of your own blood
that you are choosing.'' To Else this, for her,
seemed far in the future.

3, BESTED. .. 1862-1865

It so happened that the late autumn of 1862
found Else enrolling in the Folk High School at
Bested (sometimes written as Bedsted), one of
the larger places in Thisted Amt, though not a
big one as cities go, Though it was only four or
so miles due south of Norhaa, across Oveso and
down, one:had to travel there around the lake some
twelve miles east past Snedstrup, then turning
south at Stagstrup on southwest past several small
farm villages to the town of Hassing, and from
there still a bit farther west. Anders took her in
the wagon, for she had so many things, and gave
her the fee for her registration. She was to live
at the school with the other students and assist in
the cooking, cleaning, or anything else required of
her, for this was the custom then at those schools,
Though she hoped to spend Yule vacation at home,
there were tears when Else bid her father goodby -
how she would miss him! She had brought along
her little identification book with the official seal
upon it; 'twas the first time she had found occasion
to use it since receiving it soon after her confirma-
tion. She was really an adult now, away on her own
at boarding school in a city of some size, with her
very own roommates, But afterall she was soon
sixteen - many Danish girls were married by that age.

The Folk High Schools of Denmark had been
<span id="page-??"></span>
89 Bested

first organized the year 1844 by the Lutheran
Bishop N.F.S, Grundtvig, spiritual revivalist of
the Danish people, There were only a few of these
schools to begin with but their popularity had grown
until they were becoming nation wide, (Later on
practically all young people in the rural areas, who
could afford it, attended for additional post-school
education, and these old high schools are still in
existence in Denmark and have recently enjoyed a
revival of their popularity all over the Kingdom. )
This movement brought about a tremendous, enthu-
siastic elevation of the intellectual standards, even
in Else's time. There were still few enough of
these schools in the year 1862, and fewer still in
far northern Jutland, The city of Bested was for-
tunate to have one. Here Else found gay young
women learning to spin, weave and sew; others
simply improving their general knowledge; and
still others, like herself, hoping to specialize in.

qualify as teachers in the various Parish schools,
Young men too, and even older ones, were there.
learning more of practical farming and, when farm
work was slack, they too studied literature, geo-
graphy, etc, So here in Bested was one of these.
peasant "schools of life'', and Else Kathrine — |
Andersenwas one of the fortunate ones to be
learning there.

But she could scarcely wait for the Christ-
mas vacation, Never had she been so long away :
from those she loved, The day before Christmas
Eve, since the weather was mild for winter, Far
came to bring her home for the celebrations, —
"What are we having for the Yule feast - roast
goose?'' There were so many questions to be”
asked and answered on both sides as father and:
daughter rode along towards Norhaa. Did Karen
have a suitor yet? 'Nej.'' ''Was Stine looking
well to her studies for her confirmation next»
spring?" "Ja,'' -- but she has been sick and
missed some,'! Then it was Ander's turn for the
questions, ''Have you seen ought of those 'Mormon
Dippers' there in Bested?'' (This was something
that had been worrying him.) 'Nej.'' But Else
had heard from her roommates that some were
holding meetings near by. Then Far changed the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 90

subject: "Are there nice young men at the High
School then?'' "Ja, ja,'' she said, blushing some,
"But for these Ihave no concern!'' Her father
clucked his tongue and shook his head, ''Nej, nej,
are our daughters now to be all spinsters?"' Then
he smiled from the corner of his eye and winked at
her, ''There's plenty time yet''.

''Welcome, welcome'' was Mette's greeting
as she hugged her second daughter to her, There
was such excitement at her homecoming! What a
warm, friendly, merry household was here. This
turned out to be the gayest Yuletide of all, The
girls could scarcely get through one mess of dishes
and turn around till another group of company came.
Many relatives and all Else's old friends called in,
seeming happy to bid her welcome home again, if
only for Yule. She was a favorite with young and
old for she was not as shy as the generous, warm-
hearted Karen or yet as the sweet, courageous
Stine, Little Marie was more outgoing and con-
versant, like her, but somewhat flighty. Else's
happiest hours of all were the quieter ones, there
with her family all about her. How she loved them!
One had to get away sometimes to view ones bless-
ings in a clearer light. Surely she had lived as
rich a youth as was granted only a few!

As Else listened to the preaching of the
famous Bishop Grundtvig, when he came to talk
to them there at the school in Bested that mid-
winter, her blood was stirred with an urgency to
achieve. He talked of faith but said that work too
was important, Danish youths must improve their
minds and skills if they were to save the future of
Denmark. Praying was important and necessary,
but not enough. Other lecturers came to the school
occasionally and sometimes the older male students
stood up and told of their experiences, The Pastor
or Priest of the Parish church there at Bested was
often there to preach. One time he chided the
younger students for not attending the services in
the church and urged them to attend, lest their
souls should be lost. Else was guilty, as were
most of the others; the services were so dull it
was scarce worth their time to go, There were
<span id="page-??"></span>
91 Bested

many Danes, even old ones, who never stepped
inside the churches except for special occasions
such as baptisms, weddings, funerals and burials,
and of course,: Confirmations. Since the new con-
. stitution some twelve years before, baptism in the
Lutheran church was no longer compulsory - but
children must be washed of their sins before death!
To be legally married one had to go to the Priest
and one couldn't dream of having his loved ones
buried elsewhere than in the churchyard, All
Danish boys and girls wanted to be.confirmed, this
too: was important; .yes, these things:most Danes
attended to, otherwise they let the church just
stand there, (In Denmark, even at the present
time, the average attendance at.the Lutheran
Church is less:than 2% of its membership; yet»
90% of the people come to obtain their confirma-
tions,’) :

“One morning, a few Sabbaths after the :
Priest's scolding, Else and some of her room -
mates attended the meeting at his church. There
were a number of the other young students there
also, for the Priest's talk had roused them: Now
this "holy man" took good advantage of his young,
captive audience that morning to unleash a torren-
tial, verbal blast against the intrusion of some of
the 'devil's advocates" into their peaceful Parish.
He urged his listeners to ''go forward, armed with
righteousness and break up the _gatherings of these
vile blasphermors who dared to call themselves
'Saints', Drive them from our midst and let these
‘godless Mormons' know that there is no place for
them here among Christians !'"' Then the Priest
read from a recent Kobenhaven newspaper what
the press there had to say of them and it was bad
indeed. Else thought she had never heard such
rantings and goings-on from any pulpit before, |
even against the "evil one" himself. A group of
young men gathered around the Priest afterwards,
but Else and her friends hurried back to the high
school, talking excitedly together. One of the.
older girls whom they respected put. ina good ©

“every right to worship as they chose, the new _
constitution guaranteed them that, Though public
meetings had been banned for them in some places
<span id="page-??"></span>

heretofore, it was not so in Bested; the Mormons
had bothered few here, It was no longer American
preachers only who led these people, for many good
Danes were now among them, Else had seen some
of these and they were not evil looking or speaking,
but fine appearing, upright young men. Besides,
one could not always believe what the Priests said
for they could not agree but fought among them-
selves as to what was right or what was wrong to
preach. The older girl begged the others to.say
naught, at school or elsewhere, of her remarks
and swore them to secrecy - there was no need to
stir things up. But there was plenty of talk at the
school the next day about ''those Mormons" regard-
less, It seemed that some rough fellows had
broken into their meeting place there on the out-
skirts of Bested the night before and attacked their
two preachers, These were mocked and beaten
and their coats torn from their backs, It was a
good thing that the police finally came to stop it

or all the congregation of them would have gotten
the same treatment; 'twas doubtful that any Mor-
mon trash.would ever come back there to pray and
preach, Some of the attacking mob had been jailed
overnight and then released, but others got away.

It was. suspicioned that some of the latter might
have been. young students from the High School and
the re.was talk of an investigation, but no one thought
in the least that there would be one, nor was there,
"Indeed?'' Else looked at the young men she had
seen with the Priest at the church last morning and
held her tongue, but her thoughts said it for her,
"Is this then so Christian?" |

Winter slid into spring, then all the north
came blooming into summer and Else had good
news when she returned home then, They were
pleased with her at the school and said if she would
return there the following winter term they would
be happy to recommend her to the children's school
in Bested for a position the following year. Far
and Mor were well pleased at the word and proud
too. They had many fine dreams they had dreamed
for their children. But too, Else had some things
perplexing her in her heart, of which she dared not
<span id="page-??"></span>

speak, But these were soon mostly forgotten in
the joy of being home again with her beloved family.
All were there this summer except Christen, who
had gone in the army. He was a roamer anyway
and seldom at Norhaa of late, for he had taken up
with rough men, Karen was still working in the
embroidery shop there and Stine was fully con-
firmed now, though she was not at all well. She
had an asthmatic condition but was better some in
summers and so courageous and patient withal.
Northwest Jutland was bad for asthma sufferers
and there were plenty of them there. Mads,
eighteen now, might have to go in the army too,

if there was any unrest in the country; but now he
was helping Far on the farm and with the cattle,
and things had gone well with those, Marie, bless
her heart, would soon have her eleventh festival,
they would all celebrate it with her; she was the
only summer-born member of the entire family.

Else rode with her father again and there
was talk over the fences of ''those awful Mormons -
thousands of them there were now in the country";
but there was greater talk of Holstein and Slesvig
this summer in Norhaa. Everyone was sick of
that question - it was time the government did
something about it! She discussed this problem
with her father but of the things that trembled
hardest on her lips she dared not speak. She
sat near her mother, as Mette fetched the butter
churn from the closet and then bore in some pans
of milk and skimmed them, and while she churned
they talked of many things, did other tasks like
spinning or weaving or sewing carpet rags, There
was always something to put ones hands to. She
too could do these things now and cook well too
and help with the milking; but for fine sewing she
cared little. Mette did most of the talking and
gave much advice, when they were together;: Else
wished she could speak to her of what was in her
heart. She walked and talked and sat and sang
with her sisters and Mads, and they even practiced
dancing together, like they did at the school, and
gymnastics. Would they ever be so carefree
again? And so the summer flew away and it was
harvest time and the threshers came; they no
longer had to thresh their grain with flails in the

barn, as before, but they still gathered the fresh
straw for bed tickings and to place under the newly
woven carpet, Soon it was time to leave for school
again and Else had not yet opened her heart fully to
anyone at home.

The constant headache was the Slesvig
question. The German Confederation (of which
Holstein was a member) was constantly interfering
with Denmark's relationship with her two southern
provinces, Slesvig and Holstein, This problem
had been supposedly settled more than ten years
before, by international treaty, but the Germans
wouldn't let things alone and kept trying to draw
Slesvig into the Confederation too, in order to
take both the provinces away from Denmark's rule
eventually, There was constant trouble down there
and finally the Danish government's patience was
exhausted, It was decided to settle the question
once and for all, radically, by incorporating Slesvig
definitely into Denmark as a State instead of a
Province. This was a dangerous step, for it
meant that Denmark would be breaking the peace
treaty that had been honored for some more than
400 years, since the time the Danish King,
Christian I, proclaimed that Slesvig and Holstein
should be "forever undivided". Naturally the
government realized this situation was a serious
one but, in spite of it, an act to this effect was
passed by the Danish parliament Friday evening
13 Nov. 1863. It needed only the King's signature
to make it into law. Two days later, Sunday 15
Nov., King Frederick VII died at Glucksburg
Castle, before having had time to sign the act.

Everyone realized the situation was acute
and there was talk in every city and village.
"When the news reached Kobenhaven by telegram
on Sunday evening, all theatres stopped their
performances, guns on the coastal fortresses
thundered out a mourning salute for the last King
of the old Royal House, and tens of thousands of
people filled the streets leading in towards
Christianborg Palace, where the Prime Minister,
Hall, with the traditional cry of, ''The King is
dead, long live the King !"' proclaimed Prince

succession agreed upon by international treaty at
London, England 8 May 1852. The new King was
faced with the immediate problem and, it took him
three days to decide.to sign this act, known as, the
"November Constitution", ; ae

But there was no dilly-dallying down in
Germany; here the effect was immediate and —
Denmark was presented with a carefully calculated
ultimatum right away demanding that the new act
be repealed, Opinions in the country were sharply
divided; ‘the government resigned in anger anda
new one was formed, The regular Danish army,
stationed in Holstein, was withdrawn from there »
“back to the southern border of Slesvig, to demon-
strate ‘that Denmark had no ‘intention of retaining

Christmas that year in Norhaa was hardly

the church on Holy days and sang hymns about the
"Fatherland" under silent bells, and prayed for
peace and the safety of their soldiers. So many of
the young men from the town and surrounding vill-
ages were in the army now for it had been built up,
incase, Christen was down at Danevirke, Mads
wanted to go, but Mor clung on to him and wept; he
was not the age yet until spring; perhaps there
would be no war or it would be over before then
and he would ''draw a pass'', But Mette was not
all tears; in truth she was rather excited about a
family of old acquaintances of hers who had
recently moved to Norhaa. A good family, of the
better class, trades-people and of the nobility too,
way back -- besides, they had a marriageable son!
He was a little older and well-traveled, and had not
long since returned from Kobenhaven. (Mor had it
from the neighbors that he was "looking'' and would
fain have himself a wife from Norhaa. She was
anxious that he should meet her daughters and had
invited his family to tea at mid-Yule. )

' Else would have spared herself and gone else-
where when Mors' old friends came; she was not in
the marriage market and had no mind to be stared
at, up and down, by any wife-hunter! But Mor
kept her eye on her the live long day. Luckily the
talked-of-son didn't come with his parents to tea,
but Else was stared at nevertheless, and asked
many questions by the visitors, as was her sister
Karen, who blushed and stammered some at each;
and Else knew they questioned Mor too, on the side,
All the rest of Yuletide her mother kept buttering-
up the not-so-young.man in her presence, at every
opportunity, till she grew sick of his very name,
could she remember it. On the twelfth day of
Yuletide however, the son himself called, unex-
pectedly, to pay his respects to the family and ask
their pardon for not coming before, Else tried to
withdraw but was not quick enough; she hoped he
would set his eyes on Karen, for she was so willing
for a suitor, She could tell Mads liked him right
away. He turned out to be well educated, by his
conversation, and witty and pleasant too. True,
he was a bachelor, but not as old as some, and he
was rather good looking, in the Danish way, and
taller than Mads and taller than her too. Mette

fussed over their visitor, smiling all the time,. and
you could see right away that she had her heart set
on something. As the visit drew to a close, Else
thought that she could like this fellow, but when he
pressed her hand in goodby she knew she could:
indeed! But whether she threw her shoe over her
left shoulder that Twelfth Night or dreamed of any-
one, only she herself knew--likely she dreamed of
war.

Then it was no longer just a rumor but be-
came known for sure that Otto von Bismark, who
had just become Prussia's Minister of State, had
readied his newly built-up army, joined forces
with Austria, and was preparing to back up the
Holsteiners and march against the Danes army at
Danekirke, winter or not, He wanted war, and
the chance to try out his new troops and impress
the Prussian King and the Prussian people them-
selves and show just what this new army of his
was worth, The excitement in Denmark became
so great at the thought that one could imagine
hearing swords clashing in the sky! But that was
only the beginning, for when it was announced that
the Hoisteiners had freed a thousand convicts to _
march against Jutland, everybody eligible there
joined up. Suddenly men and boys were marching
on every road and Mads was with them; Mette had
no longer been able to restrain him. People came
running on every road too, to tell the latest news,
and hurried to the towns and stood around on the
squares while the bands played under flying flags,
In every house giris picked lint, not knowing for
what purpose exactly, except that it had something
to do with the firing of guns, Farm hands helped
make cartridges at the school houses and prac-
ticed shooting, day after day, and the most
ordinary peasants spoke passionately of dying
willingly for Denmark, shaking their shovels and
pitchforks and calling back and forth over their
fields. Yes, war was all drums and flags and
passion at first, but after that came the killing!

To Danish minds ''Danevirke'' was a myth
surrounded by historical romanticism; for actually
the embankment was useless, In most places it
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 98

had long since collapsed or been washed away.
Originally, only the eastern boundary had required
defending, for the country to the west was all bog
and marshland, But now it had dried up consider-
ably, and furthermore the meadows and marshes
froze over and thereby became as firm as the rest
of the land, Here then at Danevirke were gathered
40,000 Danish men, hoping to hold a front some 60
miles long, if and when the enemy attacked,
General de Meza, who had the full confidence of his
troops and the reputation of being fearless, was a
"cool commander'', He spent his time at his head-
quarters setting French sonnets to music or
designing ivory handles for his broom, He was
meticulously careful about his health and fussed
endlessly over his uniform and his white gloves,"
even though war was at his very tent door and the
enemy was taking its position near by to prove it!
One morning, after taking his regular ride around
his defense lines he wrote in his diary, 'I was
shot at! Ido not understand what they think they
are doing,"

Feb. Ist, 1864, the combined Austro-
Prussian army of 60, 000 crossed the Holstein
border and marched northward, It would have
been impossible for General de Meza's outnumbered
forces to hold Danevirke against them, and he knew
it. He called a retreat of his troops and in the
middle of the night of Feb, 5th, the whole Danish
army crept stealthily away toward the north, over
iced-up roads and with a fierce snow storm blowing
full in the faces of its endless, trudging columns,
After hours and hours of weary marching the Danes
set up their new defenses at Dybboel Hill, where
there was a chain of ten rather small earthworks.
Their enemy had noticed nothing till next morning,
but then immediately took up the pursuit.

Throughout all Denmark the news of the
Danes withdrawal from Danevirke, their ancient
defense line, glamorized by tradition, gave the
Danish subjects a jolt and the shock was almost
more than they could bear. A great howl went up,
and the people wept and wrung their hands and
mourned as they had not done for generations,
The government, fearful of the blame, hurridly
<span id="page-??"></span>
99 Bested

made a scapegoat of General de Meza and had him
dismissed, (Some said he was a traitor!) This
was an unpopular political move, grievously unjust
and gravely unwise; but that was not all. The fact
began to sink in that Denmark's present allies,
England, Russia, Norway and Sweden, had no
intention of coming to her aid, as the Danes had
fully expected them to do, but simply stood by and
let her go-it-alone against ambitious, war-thirsty
Austria and Prussia (who within a few decades
were to consolidate into the powerful German
Empire).

As these forces gathered against the greatly
outnumbered Danish troops, they were also better
trained and better equipped with infinitely superior
arms, having breech-loading rifles capable of
firing off a dozen or more rounds for every one
fired by the Danes! old muzzle loaders, as well
as being much more accurate and far-shooting.
Their artillery too was far superior, which was
to prove catastrophic for the Danish positions at
Dybboel, The Germans dug themselves into zig-
zag trenches a few hundred yards from the hill, |
across a wide fjord, and kept firing away until
they had completely destroyed the earthworks
there, But still the Danish clung to it, week after
week, while day after day their soldiers marched
up the highway and relieved each other in the
shattered redoubts, or lay encamped on the muddy
winter fields, and let themselves be shot at.

Else Katherine sat in her room at the High
School in Bested, with her Bible before her. |
Mads' letter lay there too where she had dropped
it. ''The news from the front is not: good", he had
written, "all this marching,- marching in the mud
and snow, with nothing but hardtack and three
shillings a day. The soldiers al! set up in front |
to be shot at while the officers ride safe behind",
He had made light of it but she knew it must be
frightful in all that cold and shooting. Christen,
he had said, was among those missing at Dybboel
Hill, (She had wept silently at this, for she was
fond of her half brother in spite of his rough ways,
and her heart ached for Mette too ~- he was her

first-born, ) Mads said he had seen their visitor
of last Twelfth-Day, the tradesman's son, during
the retreat from Danevirke, and he had asked
about her, (So he was init also!) So far, Mads
himself was unscathed, but only heaven knew how
long that would be so, for hundreds were wounded
and dead already, (She had prayed nightly for
Mads safety, and the rest.) Her thoughts ran back
and forth continually. How frightened she had been
recently, the nights of Feb. 13th and 14th to be
exact, when that terrible wind visited Jutland,
blowing down houses and uprooting trees every-
where in a wild fury, as if heaven itself was in on
it! The very schoolhouse had seemed to rock to
and fro like a drunken man, and she had wondered
then if the great judgment was about to come upon
them,

Else drew a sheet of paper from between the
pages of her Bible, as she sat, and casting her
eyes furtively here and there to make certain she
was unobserved, unfolded it and read what was
printed for the dozenth time or more: "A Voice
of Warning! The day is at hand when kingdoms,
governments, thrones, are falling; plagues,
pestilence, famine are walking abroad; whirl-
winds, earthquakes, wars, proclaim the truth of
prophecy. . .'"' It was foolish to chance being
caught with such writings ~- she must tuck the
Mormon tract back into the Holy Book again, As
she reached for the Bible to do so, a certain line
of type, where it lay open, held her gaze: ''And I
saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kingdom
and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice,
Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of
his judgment is come. . ."" Ja, Ja, this was the
very passage of scripture Elder Hansen had
referred to at their last meeting.

There were only girl students at the High
School now and they spent most of their time doing
war work, inquiring after their fathers, brothers
or sweethearts at the front, or discussing excitedly
all the news and rumors which came their way.
Their young voices shook with emotion when they

talked of the foe shooting its way up into North
Jutland, Should these Germans gain a great
victory in the end Little Denmark might even be
obliterated, or at least divided up between the
German states and other powers. Ja, Jutland
would go to Germany, for was it not well known
that ''what the German Eagle got its claws into

it never relinquished''? There was much said
among them also about a hired maid at the school,
who had been sharply dismissed recently from
her position there, although she had no place else
to go to earnaliving. It was whispered that she
had been ''taken in by those Mormons'! and was
even planning to be "'dobt'! in their church, A pity
it was and a disgrace for all her kindred! The
whole affair was supposed to have been kept under
cover, of course, lest the school officials be
accused of over-leniency. Then there was talk of
what the Priest had said when he had come to the
High School the past week and delivered a scathing
discourse on the evils and perils of joining-up with
"that sorry lot of blasphemous sinners !'' Then
everybody there had been as fired up and in arms
against "those Mormons''as they were against
"those Germans" and still were: -- well almost
everybody there, that was. How little most of.
them knew after all.

There were no L. D. S, cottage meetings
being held then in Bested for the Danish Elders
who had been there conducting them had emigrated
to Zion Land quickly, when the war looked eminent,
or had been forced into the army. Elder Lars
Hansen was among the latter; Else supposed he
too had been fighting at Dybboel with the rest.

She had first met him at a Mormon meeting early
the past spring, where she had gone, at the invi-
tation of her last years roommate, to see and hear
the Mormons for herself. Her whole way of
believing had been changed from that time on as
she had marveled at each new gospel message
given, This winter she had been present at many
more Mormon meetings and her heart and soul _
burned with the truthfulness of the things she had
heard. Her great desire was that her precious
family should also hear and believe these wonder-
ful new doctrines,

At sea, the Danish fleet remained superior,
as usual, and kept the German ships from coming
in to help, but the German troops needed no help
from anybody. They took Dybboel Hill from the
Danes, who had hung onto it desperately for eight
weeks against the great odds, _A terrific bombard-
ment, 18 Apr. 1964, drove out the last of the
brave defenders, who pushed north to Fredericia,
last remaining fortress in Jutland, and from thence
evacuated the peninsula and scattered to the various
islands, leaving the whole of it in the hands of the
Germans, who by now outnumbered the Danish
soldiers by perhaps ten to one, The Danes had
lost upwards of 5,000 dead, wounded or prisoners,
while the ever increasing enemy's losses were set
at about 1,200. The victors soon took possession
of both North and South Jutland and oppressed the
people by collecting one war tax after another in
rapid succession, though they never crossed over
to the Islands. They won what they were after, for
the discouraged Danes gave up at last, and the
Peace Treaty, 1 Aug. 1864, gave the Austro-
Prussian Germans all of Holstein, Laurenburg
and almost all of Slesvig (Schlesvig). The final
terms were not ratified until 30 Oct., at which
time Denmark was required to give back all the
German warships her navy had captured, besides,
So for a time the hated enemy reigned supreme in
North and South Jutland, and forced the Danish
officials there to collect their taxes, Peace being
finally restored, the hostile armies vacated, having
nearly ruined the land by heavy taxations and gen-
eral depression of business, which was the unavoid-
able consequence of the war.

In the meantime the reduced family of farmer
Anders C, Christensen went about its own business
as much as. possible and attempted.to right itself,
after the upset to the country, and carry onin
Norhaa. There were no male helpers at home, or
to hire, so Anders sought the aid of his daughters.
Else, having returned from High School and being
the most skilled at outdoor things, worked side-by-
side with her father, planting, milking, and even
shearing the sheep they kept for their own use,

as any man, She was now of slightly more than
medium stature, strong, straight and well-
proportioned; a capable, gifted young woman from
the Vikings way back in a straight line, and from
the nobles too, on her mother's father's side,
Next winter she would be a full fledged teacher
and work with children in a school in Bested.

But there was one thought foremost in the
mind of Else Katherine Andersen as she worked
and planned ahead, One day she said to her
father, -- "Are you never afraid of the day when
you must stand before God's judgment?" Looking
sideways at her he answered, '''Twill be time
enough when the old bell tolls for me!" She had
hoped to engage him in serious conversation about
the life hereafter but never could seem to. He
was not a religious man. Mette too was hard to
approach on these matters, for her mind was so
well occupied with material things, besides being
intent on keeping a home of refinement befitting
descendants of noblemen; also, it seemed, there
was that never ending question of husbands for her
daughters, So many country girls never had
proper chances to marry and now so many young
Dianishmen were losing their lives in the war.

With the beginning of August the Danish
soldiers began trickling home. One happy day
Mads returned to Norhaa and he was well and
whole; it was not like this with all who were
mustered out, There was joy in the household
of Anders and Mette then, and they put out flags
to show it! Else threw her arms around her
brother in embrace and exclaimed, 'We must
thank the gracious Lord for sending you back
safely to us.'' But Mads laughed, ''Nej:, it is
those Germans we should thank for being such
poor shots,'' Then Mette chipped in, -- '"Ja,
we are all such weak people, and since we can
do nothing for ourselves all is spoiled for us;
everything must be given us from above by the
Great God Father,'' "But we are not puppets",
Else had cried, ''to be moved around by strings.
Ja, we are weak but we can be strong -- so much
in the end depends on us ourselves, Don't you
see that God expects us to strive and sacrifice for
<span id="page-??"></span>

his blessings; to work out our own salvations and
earn our own places in his kingdom?" She was
sobbing then, but with the rest there was silence,
and each one looked at her in some strange way.
Presently Far shook his head, "It is the bitterness
of this war and the future of our kingdom that
worries us all and makes us think strange thoughts,
Our Else has been working too hard, but now that
Mads has come it will be eased for her.'"' And

that was the end of that,

Christen didn't come then; perhaps he was a
prisoner, since there had been no word of him ©
among the thousands dead and wounded. It was
the prisoners who would come last. Word had it
that the tradesman's son had returned home and
nothing would do but that Mette should send Mads
over there right away to invite him and his family
to a celebration for the return of their sons, Else
seemed to forget all her worries about Christen in
the possibilities of it. It is probable that the
invited family came, but that their son came and
came again and again was surely so; for Rudolph,
the tradesman's son, had set his heart and. mind
on Else Andersen when first he saw her, (We
shall call him Rudolph, for lack of a better name
having been told us.)

Those were happy days for Else then, in
spite of the battling of her thoughts, It was more
often Rudolph now who sat with her on the bench
by the cottage door, listening to the nightingales
cry, or walked hand in hand with her in the fragrant
autumn evenings, as they talked and came to know
each other better. He listened attentively to her
when she spoke of her new-found wisdom, which
was more than her family seemed to do, to any
good purpose. But she dared not tell him yet
half of what she was thinking, He agreed with her
on many subjects, but on religious matters he was
most often silent, although once he said, following
some comment of hers, ''Strange as it may seem,
here on the earth there are numbers of religious
groups with different philosophies, many of which
think that they alone are God's true disciples, But
the center of them all is Jesus Christ our Lord
and Savior, and he, with his Almighty grace, will
<span id="page-??"></span>

have us all gathered home to himself when that
great harvest day comes,'' What could she say
to that? Elder Hansen would have known the
answer right away!

When Else asked Mads what he really thought
of her admirer he replied, 'Ja, he's good enough
for some girls but not good enough for you,"' A
typical brother-answer, but she knew Mads liked
him. Mor plied her with questions about him
night and day; it was easy to see which way the
wind blew with her, Her dear sisters, Karen and
Stine, not fortunate enough yet to have suitors
of their own, volunteered eagerly to do sewing
for her brides-chest; while twelve year old Marie,
happy and gay, was always hanging on Rudolph in
her flighty way, whenever the chance came,
showing off, Far said little about him in her
presence, but looked on with seeming approval,
though she knew the time would surely come when
he would feel obliged to speak to her sweetheart
and ask him of his intentions with his second
daughter, Else began to spend more and more
time in Rudolph's company and regard his opinions
more highly also; but just how, when or where she
first fell in love with him only she herself could
divulge,

Customs have differed in various lands and
the marriage custom is no exception. In Denmark,
an engagement was considered fully as binding as
a wedding. A hopeful couple's intentions were
supposed to be announced by the Priest from the
church pulpit for three successive Sundays, and
each of the parties involved were expected to be
present on all three occasions, Then, to bind the
engagement bargain, the groom-to-be would give
the bride-to-be a gold band for her finger, at
which time it was considered that henceforth the
maid belonged to him and they could begin living
together if they so chose -- and most chose, The
wedding itself, whether it followed soon or later,
as a matter of choice or convenience, was more
or less a formality after that, with a merry
festival thrown in of course,

Before the late autumn had waned, Else and
her sweetheart were betrothed, but whether she
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 106

consented to the Parish Priest having a part in it
we have strong doubts. However, be that as it
may, their plans were made. Rudolph would

begin raising a cottage for her, while she returned
to Bested to teach young children reading, writing
and Bible stories, for the Bible was used as a text
then in many Danish schools. Come spring again
she would return home to prepare for her wedding,
but she wished to have a try at teaching for which
she had prepared so diligently, She hoped to be

a good teacher -- and after that, a good wife. But
there was another hope which she dared not voice
but for which she prayed silently with all her heart,
night and day, Oh that her people and her love might
be guided to a knowledge of the true and everlasting
gospel; this was the import of her prayers. She
knew this was a large request -- but miracles were
happening in Denmark every day, and Else believed
in miracles,

The families on both sides were well pleased
with the engagement, but Mette herself was over-
joyed and proud at the prospects of getting so fine
a son-in-law -- Ja, and from the nobility too, way
back! She planned a bright wedding festival for
Spring; it would be her first opportunity. With
difficulty she turned her thoughts to other, more.
mundane, things. Helping Else get prepared and
off for teaching took attention, as did sewing and
fixing for Stine who would leave home for the first
time to enroll in Thisted City Folk High School,
Next year she would take her apprenticeship in a
lace making establishment, for that was what she
desired. Karen was still working in the embroidery
shop, and now Marie put up a fuss to go to work
also. She wanted no more of school for she
planned to be a housemaid or a cook, and Mor
could teach her that, Most Danish peasant girls
started working at twelve, she said, to help out.

It took some doing to get her back to the school-
house, but Mette was set on''deres bdrn'' getting
as much education as possible. Far was doing
well now with his rents and his daughters needn't
go to find employment so young. Besides the farm
and cottage, he owned an extra building or two in
town, did "householder'' Anders, Then Christen
had come back from the war and he was gloomy,

quickly upset, and he coughed a lot; anyone could
see he was not quite well, inside or out. Work
was scarce and wages low and he had not yet
established himself. Besides, he was a bachelor
still and this worried Mette considerably. He
was restless and gone from there a lot, days at
atime, and none of them knew for what, It might
be wise if he, and all of them together, were to
attend the revival soon to be held at the church
there in Norhaa, since the great Lutheran Bishop,
N.F.S, Grundtvig himself, would be present.

The Bishop was traveling all about the kingdom,
lecturing at churches and high schools, trying to
rally the Danish people from the discouragement,
bitterness and lethargy caused by the war and the
loss of so much of their land; for now they were
the smallest in Europe.

Else lived again at the Folk High School,
where she took a few classes and listened to
lectures by old men, as she could; but her day-
time hours were mostly spent in teaching at
another school in the City. She had freedom to go
and come, for which she was thankful; as it gave
her opportunities to attend meetings without unplea-
sant explanations, The Elders had returned to
Bested too, following disruptions, and cottage
meetings had been resumed there. It was not yet
considered safe again to hold public meetings in
Jutland, because of a new flare-up of mobbings
and violence, kindled by the aftermath and frus-
trations of a lost war. Danish youths, many with
nothing much to do but roam the streets. at nights,
seemed to make a serious sport of persecuting
and heckling the Saints. The police now mostly
ignored this situation, or blinked at it,. but the
Danish Priests were still very much in on the
"urging" of it, for they saw their congregations. —
dwindling because of this new religion, which :
thousands of Danes all over the kingdom had joined
during the past fourteen years,

Elder Lars Hansen was back again, with a
new companion, Else had such confidence in him
for he had taught her the gospel first of all. No
Danish Priest had ever touched her soul as he had,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 108

not even the great Grundtvig. She had been a most
ardent investigator before, but now she had come
to believe in the Restored Church with all her being.
The Elders had told her she was fully ready to be
baptised and had urged her to do so, yet she hesi-
tated; there was something of which she must be
assured first. Was it not possible, if she waited
awhile, that she and her loved ones might be all
"dobt'' in together? The Elders! advice to her had
been, -- 'Ja, but don't wait too long; the devil
himself has many tricks for the wavering!" But
they encouraged her to continue to be faithful and
prayerful, but in the meantime to use all her
powers to bring her people to an understanding of
the truth, Perhaps she herself was to be God's |
instrument in this, if it was his will that they be
led to the light.

Else considered their words, but she had
little faith in herself where her loved ones were
concerned, Hers was not what one could call a
religious family. True, they spoke of God often
and most freely, as did many Danes; but their ~
hearts seemed somewhat turned from him and set
on other things, It was as if they but parroted the
Priest, though they seldom attended his masses,
except when necessity took them there, and on
Holy Days of Yule, for excitement. But Rudolph
now -- she had strange and far-off feelings about
him, and stranger dreams; precious little she knew
about her lover after all. Her letters home were
many and full of affection, as well as of all the
carefully worded new religious ideas she dared
to put in them, The answers back, however, were
far from satisfying; mayhaps they thought her just
a ranting child. Rudolph wrote only of love and
his impatience for their marriage, and of course
about the cottage he was building. Her family too
avoided any religious discussions, but wrote of
home things and the local gossip, although they
were as friendly as always and usually ended
every letter with, ''A thousand loving greetings
from us all!'' Else felt she was getting no place
with them about the things nearest her heart -- no
place at all.

Yuletide came in such a hurry that year --
<span id="page-??"></span>
109 Bested

long before she was ready for it, There was
plenty of snow, though not too much cold, so that
Rudolph could come for her in his sleigh, with
bells a-jingling, to bring her home, Her heart
gave a leap to be near him, but there was a
feeling of restraint also, It was like black and
white, It was the same when she came to the
cottage too; she wanted to be gay, yet she was
sad. It was all so confusing, for her emotions
kept fighting themselves back and forth the live-
long time. She noted no change inthe others,
This should have been her brightest Yule. Her
betrothed was most often there, attentive and
possessive, and she liked it -- yet she liked it
not, Mette had gone to such great pains with the
cooking, The Yule gifts for her brides-chest
were elegant and many:- newly made quilts,
freshly downed pillows, embroidered cases,
sheets and underthings - the chest was now so full
she had to sit on it to shut it.

Strangely, the talk then was much about
religion and of how the famous Grundtvig had said
this-and-that and such-and-such. Had Else heard
him? Yes she had, several times, Well? She
smiled and passed it off; had she told them her
thoughts they'd have scarce agreed, Every dis-
cussion eventually got back to 'those Mormons!"
They talked of recent mobbings and Far said,
'!'Tis not good to run with mobs - let the devil
take care of his own,.'' Christen did not agree;-
"The devil could do with a little help there", he
said. He was most vicious in his attack on the -
"Saints" as he denounced them in no uncertain
terms, Poor fellow, thought Else, the war had
left him mixed up indeed. Then Mads, always
trying to make peace, said it was peoples right
to worship as they pleased, under the new consti-
tution; then his eyes twinkled, ''But perhaps these
Mormons have some good in them after all!'' My
what a howl went up as everybody got into the
discussing. Else almost swallowed her tongue.
holding back the words which were fighting to
come out of her, As the heated tirade against
the ''Saints' ran on it took turns that she dared
not try to check, though her cheeks burned with
indignation as she listened, eyes cast down,

There was no use, She felt the tower of words she
had built up so high and long to say, crumble and
fall about her in a useless heap - and her great
hope toppled with it! So she sat silent, as if
condemned, but forced a smile to cover up her
heartbreak, It was the Great Almighty himself
then who would have to produce the miracle with
them, if miracle there was to be, for Else knew
now full well that she herself could not.

Life moved along into the new year and the
weather held good, for atime, Letters went back
and forth as before, but the days and miles seemed
farther apart for Else K. She wrote no more to
her loved ones of religion however, but of school
and family affairs in the main. She asked about
the house Rudolph was building -- were the rafters
raised yet? She spoke of everyday things, but
rarely did she mention her coming wedding. From
Mor she inquired of Far, the girls, Mads, and had
Christen found himself work yet - or perhaps a
wife? How were all their kinsfolk - Tante Inger,
Onkel Peter and the cousins, and those north in
Jannerup and Hundborg, and the rest? "Ja, Ja"!
Mor had replied; everyone was well and mostly
happy and she herself was busy, busy! Her sister
Dorthe and husband Anders Simonsen and family,
and her brother Jens Hvid of Swindborg, had all
sent greetings and said to tell her "hello"; they
were all coming sure for the wedding. Even
Bedstemédder Karen's sister, great aunt Maren of
Hundborg, hoped she lived till then, though she
was feeble, "And receive the most loving greetings
from all of us here at home" she had ended, Else
supposed she had told everyone, had Mette, but
she herself had shut her mind on her wedding; she
had far more pressing things to use it for.

Those were weeks of anxiety and indecision
then; never had she felt so lost and alone. People
all around, chattering here and there, seemed so
free from care -- was she then the only distressed
one? Her mind was like a great swing of good and
evil going back and forth so fast it almost took her
breath away. Else thought sometimes that it was
with her as it was with the old Danish saying, --
<span id="page-??"></span>
lll Bested

"The good things I intend to do Ido not, but the
evil I didn't intend to do, I do,'' She wanted to do
the right thing, but how was one to know always?
One thing she did know for sure -- she wanted to
be baptised more than anything! But what of her
family? It would be impossible for her to face
them, after. She couldn't simply walk out of their
lives and never come back, could she? Then she
recalled the maid at the school -- she had almost
forgotten those at the High School, What would
they do? She had heard that men lost their jobs
and that their children were mistreated at school
because of joining the Mormons, (Perhaps it was
she herself she was thinking of more than her
family, as girls her age were apt to do.) She —
remembered some lines she had learned from
Shakespeare's ''Hamlet Prince of Denmark'';--
"There is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough
hew them though we may.'' What were her ends
to be - her destiny? The Elders had said so many
threw away their destinies for lack of courage,
"Ja, we are all weak, but we can be strong!"'

She heard herself saying those words, as she had
said them to her mother, months ago, So her
thinking and her days and nights worried on,
tormenting her until she felt at times that she
could hardly hold on to their endings,

Then it was announced by the brethren that a
special baptismal service was to be held the latter
part of the month and President Soren Jensen of
the Aalborg District was to visit Bested for that |
occasion, Several investigators from there and.
the surrounding villages were ready to be baptised,
and of course "the Lord is depending on Sister |
Else to be ready too,'' Sometimes God's ways
are so mysterious it is hard for one to understand
them; but again sometimes they are so plainto _
those who are sincerely seeking. At that moment
all Else Katherine's old, accumulated worries
flew away, for atime, and she was at peace,
"Why of course" - if the messengers of the Lord
said he was depending on her she would certainly
be baptised! No doubt she felt then somewhat as
Nephi, that great character from the Book of
Mormon, had felt when he said, "I will go and do
the things which the Lord has commanded, for I
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 112

know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto
the children of men save he shall prepare a way
for them that they may accomplish the thing which
he commandeth them, '!

Public meetings then in Denmark were pro-
tected, under the constitution--if they were
orderly, The authorities were supposed to be
notified a week in advance if any were planned.

So the Elders went to the police in Bested, telling
them they had engaged a hall for the evening of
January 25th, where they would hold a meeting
for members, investigators and any of the inter-
ested public who cared to attend, with President
Soren Jensen as the speaker, The baptismal
service would be held earlier that day, but they
did not mention that detail to the authorities. They
located a sheltered bend in a lazy river meander-
ing northwest through the edge of the city, then
turning in a big loop, picking its way southwest
again towards Orum Sound, into which it finally
emptied, The weather was cold and streams were
frozen over, but Jutlandic winters were ever like
this; one could not always choose summer to be
baptised.

Just before dusk crept down and closed the.
gates of day, the late afternoon of Wednesday
January 25th, 1865, the ice was broken through
in the place they had decided on and the baptisms
began, followed by the confirmations, There were
only a few present but Else Kathrine Andersen was
among them, It is strange how warm cold can
seem sometimes, especially when one is heated
from within by the spirit, Else, clothed all in
white, as were the others, hardly shivered at all
in the icy water as Elder Lars Hansen ''dobt'' her,
or right after that either as Elder Soren Jensen
confirmed the baptism assisted by Elder Hansen
and conferred on her the Holy Ghost. Then it was
over for her and she knew she would never be alone
again, if she kept faithful. She was a Latter-day
Saint - a Mormon - and she felt wonderful--so full
of peace and contentment! The wet ones changed
into dry clothes behind the quilts others held up,
brought for that purpose, and then bundled in |
heavy coats, boots, warm shawls for the women
<span id="page-??"></span>
113 Bested

and caps for the men, they all walked together a
mile or so through snowy lanes to the meeting
hall, close to the outskirts of the city. Others
were present there when they arrived, but they
were few in numbers and mostly women,

They sang a hymn and someone opened with
prayer and then, following the Sacrament, names
of the newly baptised members were announced
and each stood up, Elder Hansen was in charge
and introduced the speaker, Elder Soren Jensen,
President of the Aalborg District, ''an obedient
and faithful servant of the Lord and a great
missionary' he called him, Elder Jensen smiled,
stood up and, opening his Book of Mormon, started
reading from Alma 5:37-40: ''O ye workers of
iniquity: Ye that are puffed up in the vain things
of the world" (he skipped around some) -- "if ye
are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what. °
fold are ye? Behold I say unto you, that the devil
is your shepherd, and ye of his fold; and now, who
can deny this?" -- ''For I say unto you that what-
soever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever
is evil cometh from the devil, "'

Then, of a sudden, there was such commo-
tion and clamoring outside it was as if the war had
broken loose again -- shouting, swearing, and
pounding of things; nothing could be heard above
the din of it! Elder Jensen held up his hand to
stay the congregation, who would have jumped
from their seats. A rock came crashing through
a window, then another. The door at the back of
the worshipers was flung open and lights from
torches leaped at the ceiling behind, Were they
to be baptised in fire now? thought Else, Now
they were frozen to their seats with fright,

Stones began to fly, someone pounded as if to
knock the hall to pieces, and all the time the
yelling and cursing went on! Else thought
suddenly of the young male students at the school
and their threats she had heard so recently; could
they have followed her? She clutched her shawl
more closely about her face; -- dared she look
behind? Windows were being smashed again and
it sounded as if everything loose back there was
being hacked up and flung out into the gutter. The

devil himself was loose in Bested that night! There
was deep silence for a tenth of a minute; terrible,
stiffening silence, Then a voice close in back of
Else thundered out a horrible oath. She knew that
voice! Quickly she turned -- and gazed straight
into the face of Christen! She cried out his name,
then weeping came on her. It had all happened so
fast. At the cry of her voice, the havocking
mobbers hesitated, then turned and rushed from
the hall as suddenly as they had come, Christen in
the lead, and dissolved into the night, taking their
torches with them; while Elder Jensen still stood
there at the speakers table, like a Danish statue,
his hand raised as if in benediction, Who could
have dreamed that a miracle would happen that
night?

In the last part of January, a terrifically
hard winter had set in, with snowstorms and frigid
temperatures in all the Scandinavian countries,
"freezing the Baltic and the Belts, breaking off all
steamboat communications, as well as stopping the
railroad trains for several days. This made the
sending of mails and traveling not only inconvenient
but very irregular, on account of the great depths
of the ice and snow.'' In Thisted Amt, where there
were no trains then, public coaches were delayed
or stopped entirely for a period; children were
kept home from school; church meetings were dis-
continued temporarily; farmers were hard pressed
for the safety of their livestock; and all people who
could manage it stayed indoors till the worst sub-
sided, It was most unusual, even for Denmark;
hardly anyone had ever remembered so bitter a
winter.

As the stagecoach, bound for Norhaa, jolted
along the snow-clogged road at the pace of a snail,
Else reviewed the events of the past two weeks.
Her busy mind kept throwing itself back to unplea-
sant happenings, those she cared least to recall: --
that dreadful night of January 25th; the uproar at
the High School a few days later; her dismissal
from her teaching position, when the 'Lensman"
had shouted at her some vile accusation, which
burned her cheeks even now as she remembered it;
<span id="page-??"></span>

the trudging through the piles of wet snow with her
little identification book which needed to be stamped
against her leaving, and the impudent questions of
the police at the time; her hurried packing right
after, and the utter loneliness she had felt at.
having all her bridges burned around her in Bested,

There: was no-one else in the north-going
coach for her to speak to, except the old coach- |
man, who-was busy with his pipe and his own
thinking, as well as with the oft-stumbling horses
ahead, Else pulled her coat and shawl more
snugly:to her in the drafty vehicle, settled the
robes closer around her legs and placed her.

booted feet more firmly on the heated stones
again, Nothing could keep out the chill of this
Jutlandic winter, she thought, and surely only
desperate people like herself would be traveling
-in-it. Though exhausted, she couldn't sleep, for
the choppy movement of the coach kept throwing »
her back and forth; and besides, her feelings were
all mixed up inside her.. She feared the worst at
Norhaa, for she had received no letters from
there since her baptism, even from Rudolph;
though she had thought she would faint with expec-
tation, What had Christen told them, if anything?

Else was going home now to ease her mind,
one way or another -- but supposing she were
unwelcome there? Her lips quivered at the
thought, She had given up her hopes of the family
joining the Restored Church, there was too much
bitterness in them against it, Neither would
Rudolph join, she felt now, for he was narrow-
minded like the rest; nor did she suppose he would
hold her to their wedding bargain, once he knew,
for he was proud too, like her mother, She was
surprised at being able to banish him from her
future so lightly, but marriage now held little
charm for her, especially with a non-member,

At first»she had considered emigrating, if worst
came at home, but this took lots of money, she
had heard, and she had little enough, having been
unable to collect the last due her at the school
because of leaving her position ''on such short
notice and for. such bad reason", the authorities
there had said. How quickly she had grown from
<span id="page-??"></span>
Bested 116
girlhood to womanhood in the past few months.

Else ate her cold lunch as she rode along,
and turned her mind back again to Bested and her
last few days there, In her anxiety at losing her
position and all, she had sought out Elder Hansen
for comfort and advice, He had taken her to the
humble cottage of some friendly converts, where
she had found lodging, till she knew what next to
do. They had talked then of her problems, for
she had needed to talk to someone with sympathy
and understanding, more than anything. She had
spoken of her uncertainty of things at home, her
present unhappiness with her marriage bargain,
and even of emigration - but her lack of money for
it. She wanted to do the right and wisest thing, she
had stated, but above all she wished to do the things
her Heavenly Father desired of her, no matter how
difficult or sad, though the thoughts of grieving her
family and being forced to separate from them in
harshness,’ if so 'twas proved, would be hard
indeed for her to bear, Other employment she.
must have, and soon; she was willing to work at
anything, she confessed, but where in this terrible
weather would one go to find something?

The good and kind Elder had listened patiently
all the while, as she had talked herself through in a
constant flow of words interspersed with tears; then
had drawn something from his pocket and shown it
to her, She herself had received no letters lately,
but Elder Hansen had; and one in particular in
which he. thought she might be interested, It was
from an old friend of his whom he hadn't seen since
the war, Elder Lars Christian Myrup. He and his
missionary companion were then laboring in the
most southern part of Thisted Amt, at the village
of Kobberod, near the water, Here they were
teaching a fine family of investigators, a well-to-
do farmer and his sickly wife, together with six
children, three of them very young daughters who
were in much need of a governess, their last one
having left in haste when they let the Mormon
missionaries into their home, The Elder said he
had a great desire to help those good people find
someone for their little girls, particularly since
he found himself in the awkward position of being

117 Bested

the 'mischief-maker'", having been one of the
Mormons they let in, It would be the greatest

and most friendly favor, he had written, should
Elder Hansen find someone responsible in his

area who could qualify. An intelligent, person-
able, capable Mormon sister would be most desir-
able, since this would not only solve his immediate
problem but might also be the means of hastening
the baptisms of these family members, He was
especially set on these baptisms, Elder Myrup had
confided, since he had his eyes on the eldest daugh-
ter, ‘Then’he added aP.S, -- ''The farmer can
afford to pay well but the applicant must be able

to furnish proper references, of course,"!

"Of course !'! -- Else remembered how her
hopes had tumbled at this last, but up until then
she had been listening with mounting eagerness
to the letter recital. She had thought, Who now
would give 'proper'' references to a runaway
Mormon convert? Most of her few pleasant
memories lately had been thus sprinkled with
bitterness, like black pepper. Elder Hansen had
spoken then, as if in answer to her thinking, --

"JT will vouch for you myself, Sister Andersen, if
you desire the position; and I promise you, in full
faith, that you shall obtain it, if this be so!'' Then,
since she was silent, considering, he continued,
"Who can say but that if you are frugal and dilli-
gent you may be able to emigrate in the spring?
Elder Jensen, myself and others of my family
from Jutland, are leaving for Zion in early May

on a ship the church has secured. There is much
chance of employment in the valley of the moun-
_tains and I have friends there who would help you, "'
All of a sudden she had blurted out, before she
could stop the words, -- "Are you a bachelor |
then?'' And Elder Hansen had smiled and answered,
'"Nej - Ihave a sweet wife and new-born son in-
Aalborg. I haven't seen the wee one yet but they

say he favors me.'' After a pause, and rather
raspy then, as if her throat were dry, she had
gotten out the words, -- 'I will take the position -

and be most thankful for it - but first I must go.

himself had bid goodby then, after having promised
to write his friend Lars in Kobberod and make all

arrangements for the position for her, and let her
have word of it in Norhaa as soon as a letter came
back, He had taken the address of her parents to
reassure her, Else herself had stayed ona few
more days at the humble cottage and then boarded
the first available stagecoach going north, She
remembered again, as the horses tugged and
strained at the coach in the deep snow under the
fitful prodding of the coachman!'s whip, the lines
she loved from ''Hamlet", -- ''There is a divinity
that shapes our ends, rough hew them though we
may.'' What will be will be, she thought, She had
done the best she knew - what came now was up to
heaven. But it would be so good to be home again,

It was past dark when they arrived at her
parents! cottage. There was no one standing at
the door to greet her for she was not expected,

The coachman's sharp commands to the flagging
animals, the flash of swinging lanterns, and the
grinding of coach wheels to a stop, however,
brought a pull-back of a curtain at the front window
and then a loud calling inside -- 'Far, Mor, it is
Else!"" Then the door was flung wide and Karen
was there on the stoop in one and the same breath
nearly. At the same moment giggling Marie flew
out from the kitchen, and there were kisses all
around as her sisters helped her carry in her
valises and boxes, Her father stood up smiling
from his chair, putting his pipe away, reaching

out as she ran to him and almost smothered him

in her embrace, "Else, my Else", he almost

sang it; 'to think you should have come back to us
on your eighteenth festival!'' She had forgotten her
own birthday. ''February 9th, eighteen years ago,"
Far continued; 'how well I remember - it was
almost such a night as this when you first came

to us, We were expecting someone then - a boy

I had hoped", and he winked at her in the old way.
Then all was well here afterall, Else thought; but
where was her mother? She went then and stooped
to plant a kiss on the pale cheek of the ailing Stine,
for she was sitting by the fire, propped up in a big
chair, smelling of mustard plasters and other
remedies for her old complaint, She'd been brought
from the school at Thisted, she said, for the damp
and cold had set her breathing queezily again. Else

seated herself by the fire then and her father
insisted on pulling off her boots and shoes and
chaffing her feet, as he used to when she was a
little girl -- but there was still no sign of Mor.
Karen poured a cup of coffee and brought it
steaming to her where she sat, and just then

Mads stomped in from outside, clearing his boots
and shaking his great coat and, in his surprise,
would have taken her in a bear-hug, coffee and all,
had she not saved herself, Christen'was the only
one absent now, they said. Else was glad for that,
but kept worrying about her mother, for it was so
unlike Mette to stay out of things, She wanted to
ask about her but something held her tongue; per-
haps she feared to shatter the sweet contentment
of those moments,

Then they put her to the table with Danish
soup and dumplings, ladled out piping hot from the
kettle; the rest had eaten, they said, Else thought
she would founder -- no one could make soup and
dumplings like her mother! Having thought of her
again she needs must ask then, ''Is Mor ill?"
Karen leaned to her quickly and whispered, --
"She has been so distraught about you since she
heard, but she will see now-that it isn't true and
feel well again.'' So, thought Else, her premoni-
tions were not unfounded, Then her father cleared
his throat and added quietly, ''There have been
some rather ugly rumors here about you daughter,
and Mor has taken them rather badly. She is a
proud woman, as you are aware, and has had many
high hopes for you. Go in to your mother dear and
tell her all is right with you.'' 'But of what am I
accused then?'! Else asked, sparring for time and
words in which to tell them the worst, though she
had rehearsed this moment and the words a hundred
times over in her mind, She ionged to be spared
the ordeal till morning at least, for she was so
weary. But Mads said, looking straight at her,
"Christen says you meet and pray with Mormons,
for he has seen you at it! I fear he has said the ©
same all over Norhaa and elsewhere, by now."
Then Rudolph knew also, she thought quickly; but
yet she hesitated, Still, what had she hoped to |
face here afterall but this? At last she said,
rising, "I will go in and speak to Mor.'' But of a

chamber, disheveled, with eyes red from weeping.
"IT will save you the bother, '' she said in as cold a
voice as Else had ever had from her, ''Tell us!"

she half commanded, ''we are all here but Christen;
tell us - Can you deny these things that have brought
us all down to disgrace in our homeland?'"!

There was no other way out then for Else, so
she turned and faced her family squarely, almost
as if at bay, expecting the worst, and told them in
as gentle a manner as she could: -- 'Ja, Christen
did not lie; all he said is true - and more, Iama
Mormon now. Iwas baptized the very day of the
night he saw me. Ihave been dismissed from my
position at the school too, because of it, so have
come home to you. Is there else you would have
me go inthis weather? Is there anything wicked
in believing a better way or living a better life?"
Her voice quivered to a halt then; she had been sur-
prised at her own courage but more still that they
all stayed to listen, even Mette; although she
started speaking again the minute Else had ceased,
'What of Rudolph then - have you no feelings for
his pride? Do you expect to hold him to his wedding
bargain?'' Else sensed a faint flicker of hope in her
mother's voice at that last question, but answered,
''‘Nej -- I could not put him to such great test of his
love, Though I still regard him fondly as ever, I
could never marry a non-Mormon now; so I shall
pray him to free me from the bargain, '' Then she
took the gold band Rudolph had given her from her
finger and laid it gently on the table by her, asking
Mads if he would take it to him and beg him to
come there to the cottage that she might ask his
forgiveness, .

At this Mette flung herself back into her bed-
chamber and onto her pillow, with noisy weeping
and wailing. Then Stine was seized with such a
coughing and wheezing spell that both Karen and
Else rushed to her and moved her arms up and
down and pounded lightly on her back, until she
was relieved; and then Karen helped her to her
room to bed, Marie would have stayed there with

ring and readied himself for outdoors again,
looking less than happy about it though. Soon only
Else and Anders were left standing there by the
fire and Else turned and threw her arms about her
father, sobbing, ''Far, Ilove you!" But Anders
put her gently off and sank into a chair, head in
hands, She hurried then and knelt down by him,
for she still had much to say; yet when he turned
his face to her at last, the words stuck in her
mouth at the sight of his-unhappiness; and it was
he who spoke first then, but it seemed painful for
him for his voice shook with emotion, ''Else",

he said, ''Your whole life we have tried todo
nothing but good for you. I remember when you
were a tot, how you rode on my shoulder and
hung on my hair till it hurt, but the pulling-hurt
was sheer joy because I loved you so much! Ever

of my offspring, but your clasp has seemed
firmest and strongest, somehow. Now this
terrible thing has come on us and it seems as if
those strings must snap intwo, Why didn't some-

paused for a moment, then went on: "True, you.
are a woman now, but to your mother and me you
are still just.a child grown dearer, Can't you
give up this foolish nonsense Ganghter and be

one with us again?"

Then Else considered thoughtfully: for awhile
and at last spoke, -- 'Would you have me deny the
great truths the Lord himself has planted in my
heart? Would you have me throw away a glorious
salvation?'' He cut her off sharply then --. ''Salva-
tion, salvation'' he almost shouted, 'All those = |

was too late! Do you think the 'All Father' is
pleased that you have humiliated us before our
townsmen, friends, kinsfolk and the ‘very Priest
himself? Is he pleased that you should put your
mother to her sickbed with grief? Why would so
great a one give us such a wonderful daughter and
then take her away thus? Nej, nej, Else; 'tis the
very devil himself has done this to you - and to
us! They are of the devil, those Mormons, and

it is better that you were dead than be one of them,
No other Mormon shall ever set foot in this cottage,
I vow it!'' Karen, who had returned to her sewing
place meantime, could no longer pretend not to be
listening, so quietly plunging her needle in and out,
and spoke to her wrought up father, -- 'You can't
mean what you are saying, Far dear; surely all is
not so bad and Else will come to her senses by and
by.'' Then she turned to her sister in kindness, --
"You may sleep with me in my bed as you used to."!

Silence grew heavy in the room as all three
sat where they were for atime. Then Anders
blew his nose furiously, stood up, put more wood
on the waning fire, and went into his bedchamber
without another word or back glance, Karen too
got up, saying she would warm the bed first, and
taking Else's night valise from the corner went into
her bedroom, Else still sat there on the floor,
utterly dejected, hoping Mads would come soon,

It was too late now to expect Rudolph, Likely he
would come tomorrow, She doubted that she could
sleep for she was sure her thoughts would never
lie down and be quiet after all that had been said

to her, though there was a numbness about her as
if she herself were past thinking and feeling,
Finally Mads returned and came and sat in the
chair by her. He was gentler than she had expected
and she broke down and cried some. He patted her
arm as it lay onthe chair's arm, and told her the
outcome of his errand. ''Ja, just a liquid promise
that ran off so quickly", Rudolph had said as he
took the ring back gladly enough, ''A bargain Iam
well pleased to be rid of, with one who prefers
‘Mormon Elders' to my company. Else need not
worry about forgiveness or more about me either,
as I'll be off in the next coach for Kobenhaven
again. The Danish girls are prettier there!" This
flippancy in Else's former suitor had put her
brother on the defense in her behalf, although they
both knew the unkind words spoken were only slap-
backs for hurt feelings or injured pride - who
could tell which?

Then Else told Mads how their father had
spoken to her, and wept again in the process, She
said she could not bear to stay there much longer
in the face of it and Mor's unhappiness too, She

would only wait now until she had a letter from the
Mormon Elder in Bested, assuring her of her new

position, If that didn't arrive -- well, she just
couldn't bear to think of what then would become
ofher, ''Nej,'' she answered at his questioning,

she could never give up the new church and its
teachings, even if it meant giving up her beloved
family, which she now feared might be required
of her. She prayed for them all constantly, she
told him, that they also might be converted to the
truth and come to the same understanding that had
brought her such joy and hope for the future. Go
from Norhaa she must though, one way or another.
She had faith that the Heavenly Father would direct
her in the path she should take. Mads shied from
the religious side of things but told Else that if
she needed money he had some saved from his war
pay which she was most welcome to, She shed a
few more tears at his thoughtfulness, Then he
told her something he had never spoken of before
at home; how he had fought side by side with a
Mormon Elder in the war and was beholding to
him for saving his life at Dybboel Hill. "All on
our side were brothers in that war'' he said, and
Else answered, ''All are brothers and sisters
every day, everywhere, for are we not all God's
children?'! So they sat there softly talking, as
friendly as ever they had been, Not until the
sound of sobbing had long been overcome by
snoring in their parents' bedchamber had they

said goodnight and retired.

On the surface the following few days and
night passed somewhat as usual in the cottage,
with things never again getting completely out
of hand as they had that first night of Else's
homecoming. Here was a family of no ordinary
peasant upbringing and its members generally
knew how to behave and did it, all except Christen
that is. Else was treated with courtesy, for the
most part, and her needs were well taken care of,
But there was an underlying strain between Else
and her parents, neither of them caring nor daring
to speak more to her of what was between them,
or she to them, lest the tension explode again into
bitterness as before, Mette had ceased her weep-
ing, in the main, but ignored or avoided her

daughter; engaging herself instead with sundry
things in her bedchamber when she was not cook-
ing some of the things Else relished most, in the
kitchen, as if to remind her what she would be
missing once she left there again, If the two did
meet, at meals and the like, the older woman was
silent with high head and evasive eyes; though truly
there was a certain dignity in the way she put it
over, Only once in those days did she forget her-
self and speak impulsively before she could check
it, ''Any natural mother would try to keep her
child from walking into a fire'' she said, as if in
self defense. And Else thought, ''So, it is burning
she fears for me now!'' But once started her
mother had gone on passionately: ''Do you realize
what you have done to yourself? Anyone who leaves
the State Church is not able to marry legally or
have their children christened or their dead buried,
Have you thought of that? Do you realize what you
have done to us besides?" As she stopped for
breath, Else put in sincerely, -- ''Forgive me
Mor; I leve you dearly, in spite of our differences
and would give anything to be able to heal your
sorrow.'' Instead of offering the embrace Else
ached for then, her mother had flung herself into
her bedchamber again and thrown back over her
shoulder the words, ''You should have thought of
that when you gave your family up to run with
Mormons !'' Nothing short of her leaving would
satisfy Mor now, Else thought; then an idea had
filtered through her unhappy mind:--It was not her
mother's heart but her pride that was shattered;
not only her plans but her love too, that had been
forced aside, How her mother seemed to have
changed towards her,

Change had come over her father too, A
Danishman is king in his own household, and so it
had always been with Anders, in spite of a "husfru"
like Mette, His own children adored him, for he
had been a splendid father, Else had never known
him to rule with anything but love and gentleness
before, This man who mostly now sat so glum and
brooding, when not busy outdoors with his livestock,
was a stranger to her. There was no merry
twinkle in his eye, no sharpness of wit and humor,
no enthusiasm for her accomplishments, no fond

embraces, Yet he had not been unkind to her
since that first night nor had he spoken ought of
scorn or blame, or avoided her, But their infre-
quent conversations now were small talk, unim-
portant, impersonal; for in those days after her
eighteenth birthday, Far never again spoke to her
of deep-down things he felt sincerely or the matters
she longed so desperately to hear about--under-
standing--forgiveness--love! She sensed behind
the words that remained unsaid, the little things
he might have said and didn't, the firm unbending
of his will--like a stone, Still she herself felt
little change in her love and respect for Far, or
Mor either; it was deep hurt she felt,

The frost held on outside, and inside the
cottage as well, as far as Else and her parents
were concerned at least. But there were some
pleasant hours for her, mixed in with the gloom,
whenever the undercurrent of unhappiness was
lulled awhile in the company of Mads and her
sisters, There seemed little change in their
friendship for her, although the girls were more
restrained, Mads was like an anchor in a storm
and she clung to the security of his concern for
her and cherished each few moments they had been
able to be alone together, Karen had helped her
clean and mend her clothes and select the ones
most useful to her should she go'to be a governess,
Else wondered if it were less for the pleasure of
being of service or more for the chance of re-
indoctrinating her into her former faith, that she
helped; for Karen was by far the most devout
Lutheran of them all. Especially when they were
together in bed at nights would she say things,
such as, -- ''Just believe and live as you choose
Else, but be a Lutheran, not a Mormon." It was
as simple as that to the sweet Karen, for she
seemed unable to grasp the difference between
faiths, Stine now, like Mads, had been as loving
as ever, Else had spent much of her time talking
to this ailing sister and tending to her, ‘You have
more of a way of making me comfortable and less
ill than the others have, '' Stine had said, when she
rubbed her; 'Such wonderful hands to ease pain!"

a lot and seemed to think she was something to be
viewed with wide eyes now, ''Are you really truly
a Mormon?!'' This question her thirteen year old
sister had asked many times over in those seven
days; for now a week had passed since Else came
home.

Else had prayed constantly and fervently in
her heart that the letter would come from Bested
soon, bringing her relief from the fix she was in,
She could not bear to stay on and grieve her parents
longer, nor could she go without a place to go. Day
after day she had watched for the mailcoach in vain,
None had come to the cottage, whether on errands
or to call or visit, although word must have gotten
around that she was home, Even Christen hadn't
come, and for this she thanked heaven, It couldn't
all be blamed on the weather, Else couldn't help
but suspect somehow, in the face of it all, that
besides Christen, the neighbors, her kindsfolk,
and even her dearest friends and girlhood com-
panions, were speaking evil of her now, It was
strange too, but she imagined that the likenesses
of her very ancestors, in their old frames on the
walls, were looking down on her sternly. In other
days, long gone by, she was sure they had smiled
when she chanced to look up at them, Yes, Else
was in a fix all right and only heaven knew the end
of it.

But on the eighth day the horn of the mail-
coach came blowing at the cottage door, Marie
ran out quickly and came back bearing a letter
for Else, It was from Elder Hansen in Bested
and held wonderful news, The well-to-do farmer
in Kobberod, Christen Christensen by name (the
same as their half brother's) had sent the price of
her coach fare, plus a request that the young lady
come at the earliest moment, since they were in
much need of her there, Then it must needs be
that Else should ascertain the leaving time of the
very next stagecoach and make arrangements to
travel south on it, as well as go to the police in
Norhaa for the signing of her little book, Mads
accompanied her, lest she come to some harm
in the town through which she must walk, After
that came the packing, she could manage nothing

but the necessary things, There were all the
things in her brides-~chest to consider, all the
treasures her mother had saved up from her
babyhood and put in, She went to it by herself
and opened it, almost reverently, to have a last
look, She had room for none of those lovely
things; she would come back for them sometime.
Yet nestled on top was a small wooden box Rudolph
had carved and given her, In it were her amber
things, beads, ear-drops, brooch - and the
‘Dagmar Cross from her other confirmation, Ja,
she would take those to remember by, they would
take so little space in her valise.

By pre-arrangement, the coach came by for
Else next day at noon, She went at once to the
door of her mother's bedchamber to say farewell,
but it was shut fast.. There was no answer when
she called 'Goodby Mor'' through the wood, though
she stood there hoping for amoment. The rest
all came outside to see her leave, even her father.
Mads put in her valise and boxes and the lunch
Karen had prepared, plus a little jug of hot coffee
and some warmed rocks for her feet, She kissed
each one goodby, one by one, and embraced them
fondly, even her father, though she had only slight
response from him in return, But then he said
quietly, as if to her ears alone, "If you ever
reconsider and change your mind daughter, you
will be welcomed back", Those were his last
words to her, for then he went inside fast and
closed the door, as if afraid of himself; but Else's
heart was cheered some, As she boarded the
coach then and sat down, turning to wave farewell
to the others, she saw her mother's face at the
front window, looking. That was the last she
ever saw of her,

4, KOBBEROD . . . 1865-1866

The old coachman had no more wit than
heaven was pleased to grant him, which was little,
Else thought, as he immediately started a harangue
about things he had got wind of in the town, Some
of it concerned her, though he knew it not, and
Else's face reddened at what was being said of her

there. ‘If Il were this... wayward girl's

parents I'd... plenty soon kick her out in the
street and shut the ... door inher face, snow

or no!'' He dismissed that subject thus, though
his exact words were more highly embellished.
Else thought disgustedly, 'My parents did not
kick me out nor shut the door in my face!!! Then
she recalled Mor's shut door--but passed it off,
She had left voluntarily to save them added
embarrassment and grief - but she would return
under happier circumstances someday, she hoped.
She still longed for a miracle for her family.
"How far to Kobberod?" she asked. ''About 28
kilometers, or more than 32 American miles, but
shorter as the bird flies, '' the coachman answered,

Else was relieved when they stopped at
Stagstrup and picked up another passenger; it gave
the coachman other ears to talk into. She had
dreaded so many miles of loose chatter in her
direction. They were traveling slowly too, for
it was poor road, snow and ice mixed with mud,
and many deep ruts to pull through. The two
Danishmen smoked and exchanged gossip and
coarse jokes, punctuated with guffaws--some
about ''Mormons'"', This conversation Else ignored
as best she could, She was not priggish, but there
was a manner of unmistakable dignity about her
which, after a time, made the others unconsciously
shut their mouths on the vulgar words and begin
talking of more respectable, though to them hum-
drum affairs. Righteousness is a shield against
many things! Meanwhile, Else pulled her wrappings
up closer about her and pretended to be dozing as
she busied herself with her own musings. She
could have wept from homesickness then and there
had she been alone, strange as it was. Courage
was something she was growing into slowly. She
had never traveled this far away, though she had
longed to without seriously thinking. It was just
that this particular going-away seemed to have
such a finality about it somehow, for it was surely
not very far as distances went. When next would
she be going back to her parents' cottage, she
wondered, and what lay ahead of her now? What
would she find of happiness or sorrow in Kobberod?
It is easier to look back on things, for then one sees

the beginning and the end at almost one and the
same minute.

Time was drawing well on into the late
afternoon when they pulled up at the coach barn in
Visby, about half way, to change teams. It was
bitter cold! Else ate her lunch then, and recalled
an old Scandinavian proverb which went something
like this:-- ''When the days begin to lengthen, the
weather begins to strengthen. '' So too does the
Jutland wind, she thought; for they were now close
to the Limfjord and the wind was stiff and still
rising. The time of travel had seemed long but
she contented herself with the knowledge that all
things must draw to a close, both good and bad,
They continued on from Visby for another hour or
so, following the main thoroughfare going south,
then turned west at Ydby and followed a lesser
highway some distance to the town of Gettrup.
Here the other passenger alighted, and he seemed
to take much of the little warmth that had been in
the coach with him. Else was thoroughly chilled
and dark was gathering. They drove past a white
Parish church and on west from the town a spell,
then turned onto a farm road swinging southwest
towards the water again, She could see nothing
outside now, except where the coach lights cast
their gleam, but it was only two more miles
before they began passing straggling farm houses,
with lanterns hung out and dogs barking warnings
against their coming. They were approaching
Kobberod, the driver said, and Else straightened
her shawl and bonnet and began getting her baggage
in order, Then the long winter's ride ended for
her as the coachman pulled up right at the
Christensen's very door and dropped her,

Helped in hurridly out of the wind and cold,
midst most friendly greetings, Else was escourted

to a comfortable sitting room and soon seated by a
big open fire, which would have warmed her
thoroughly had not the cheery welcome of the
delightful family done it first. Here it seemed
then to her was the best she had ever had in all
her dreaming of it. As introductions were made
she marked the name of each, as well as the
appearance and manner, A well-bred, tidy and

comely family they were withal, Christen Christen-
sen, the "husmand'"', an upstanding Dane of some
forty-eight years, was rather tall and somewhat
stern looking, but she took to him right away
nevertheless, His frail wife, Karen, younger

than he by more than nine years, was dark haired
and attractive, and to Else seemed as loving,
gentle and gracious a mistress as one could ever
wish for, The two sons, Christen and Laurs,
looked about her very age, but when she inquired
of it she found she was in between them. Christen,
the taller and heavier one, would soon be nineteen
while Laurs, a bit shorter but with curly hair and
far more handsome, was but seven months past
seventeen, Maren, the eldest daughter, had barely
turned sixteen, She was small of stature and very
pretty, but seemed to take herself somewhat
seriously, Pouline, almost ten, was the plainest
of the four girls and she was shy and prim,
Petrine, called "'Trina', who would have her sixth
birthday in less than two weeks, was the daintiest,
most loving and adorable little miss Else had ever
seen, and seemed like the gentle Karen in so many
ways. Sena, just past two-and-a-half years, clung
to her mother and hid her face till it was hard to
judge her, Then there were the two servants who
seemed pleasant enough--a lady cook and a house-
maid, with whom Else was to share quarters.
When Mr, Christensen asked her about herself

and she told him somewhat of how she had been
forced to seek employment, they all seemed to
wonder, and his wife clucked her tongue and said,
"O Ja, --think you any of us would have done it?''
Then the son Laurs spoke up, 'Nej, --this was no
small thing it seems to me," and they all nodded --
all except young Christen. Ja, she was among
friends !

Theirs was a rambling farmhouse and there
was plenty room for much happiness there. It had
been intended for many children, but the gentle
Karen had suffered the mishaps of losing four little
ones, three of them one after another from the
cradle as it were. Had all lived there would have
been ten children living in the home now, all of
them having been born there in Kobberod in the
Parish of Gettrup. There were Christen, born

Christen Christensen himself had been born
29 July 1817 in the small scattered farm village
of Flarup, known earlier as Flarupgaard ("'gaard"
meaning farm in Danish), It is situated a few
miles east of the town of Gettrup, midway between
there and the larger town of Ydby, just over the
line into Ydby Parish. His father had been. born
in the same village, as had his father's father. and
mother also; in fact, all of his progenitors, at .-
least back to the year 1592, both male and female,
had been born within a radius. of not, more than ten
miles from Flarup (Ydby, Dover, Gettrup, Helligso,
Kobberod, etc.), or in Flarupgaard itself,
_.Christen felt pretty certain, however,. that,all of,
his forerunners had lived in that. selisame area
since before the time of the. Vikings, even. from
the beginning of habitation there,

“The aforementioned small villages and towns

are all nestled in the southern part of that region
often referred to as Thyland, or ''Thy'', the lower
half and most western part of far North Jutland,
which is cut off from the rest of it by the beautiful
Limfjord, that unexpectedly meandering, lengthy
fjord which runs diagonally across the peninsula
east and west, from the Kattegate to the North Sea.
Carved out during the Ice Age, when the receding
glaciers formed the landscapes, this largest of
Denmark's numerous fjords which enhances the
graceful smiling and more fertile part of Thy, is
so studded with inlets, coves, bays and sister
fjords, into which its blue water enters, as to be
almost unbelievable! The fjord itself is framed

in picturesque bluffs and flats, although the scenery
around it is varied, and its shores harbor many cozy
smaller towns, as well as Thisted, the largest of
those in Thy, also the large city of Aalborg, some
distance northeast of this region. The waters of
the Limfjord also surround Mors, a good-sized
green island of scenic beauty which contains some
of the loveliest scenery in Denmark; containing
also many pleasant towns and villages, particularly
the ancient historical city of Nykobing and the town
of Feggeklit, the place where Prince Hamlet, the
Danish legend says, killed his uncle King Fegge,

in revenge for the murder of his father, Horvendil,

Thy is mostly a flat region of wide horizons
and great contrasts, Very near Flarup and west
of Hurup is the highest point in the entire region,
300 ft. above sea level, offering a beautiful view
of the area. Giant chalk formations are found in
some areas, especially in the most northwestern
part at Hanstholm, where is also one of the
strongest lighthouses in the world, overlooking the
North Sea, and built during Christen's time in 1842.
Some of the slopes along the Limfjord are rich with
moler, a clay found hardly anywhere else in the
world, It is best seen south of Thisted, where
- many layers of volcanic ashes are visible in the
clay. From this clay, light, porous bricks for
insulation are made and exported to many countries,
To the west and north, Thy is bordered by the
cruel North Sea, which has been eating away at
the land for centuries, carving out and swallowing
well-off farms and even whole villages, or covering

them over with sand. In their places now is either
the ever-hungry sea or stretches of dunes and moors
where nothing good grows, and populated only by
birds and a few animals, Sand drifts have covered
much of the once fertile area northwest from
Kobberod, And still farther north and west from
there, near the town of Agger, entire villages have
disappeared over the last three centuries, Agger
Church was demolished and a new one raised more
north in 1838, and soon after that the first break-
waters were built there to control the North Sea,
both in Christen's time, (Recently, large dikes
have been constructed for the same purpose, )

On the east and south of Thy is the so-different
Limfjord and its bays. On its safe shores, Danes
have been settled from way back, including the
Viking Age, as witnessed by thousand-year old,
boat-shaped burial places which cover large areas, .
and excavations from whence Vikings set forth on
their raids across the North Sea, Here just a few
miles east, as well as south from the village of
Flarup, in the peaceful bays of this lovely fjord,
the fleets of those fierce sailing warriors had
gathered for their expeditions to England, France
and the Mediterranean, a thousand years before,

But long before that there were people in
this area. One or two thousand years before the
birth of Christ, during the so-called Stone Age
and the later Bronze Age, this was a comparatively
well populated part of the country. There is a
Bronze Age graveyard at Ydby Moor, very close
to Flarup, with more than 50 mounds, In fact,
several thousand of these mounds are scattered
all over Thy, and in its museums are relics,
original or in copy, of finds telling of those bygone
cultures, such as the famous Gold Boats from
Nors and the amber axes at Thisted museum. At
Lundehej, about ten or so miles east of Flarup,
is one of the most impressive megalithic tombs in
the whole country, purported to be about 5, 000
years old, and at Hérdum Church, a few miles
southeast from Norhaa, is kept the only known
stone hewn to the Nordic war-god, Thor, It
depicts his fight with the legendary Midgaard
Serpent. Very near Kobberod, northwest, is
Vestervig Church, once a cathedral, It was
<span id="page-??"></span>

erected around 1100 A.D., as a part of a big
Augustine monastery. North of the church is
Linden Kirstin's grave. According to legend,
Prince Buris (Henrikssdén) and Linden Kirstin,
the half sister of King Valdemar I, were buried
here after a tragic end to their love affair.

Yes indeed, Thy was a region where the
past was speaking and Christen Christensen of .
Flarup believed his progenitors had been there
when the ancient history of the area was made,
Surely they must have gathered on the bays of the
Limfjord and struck out to sea in long-ships with
the early Vikings. Most likely they fought under
King Harold Bluetooth or Sweyn Forkbeard, Per-
haps some watched on the blood-drenched battle -
field of Lyndanisse, 20 June 1219, when the Danes'
first flag 'Dannebrog'" supposedly floated down
from heaven, blood red with cross of white, Cer-
tainly some of his forefathers had been involved
when, in 1340, the peasants of North Jutland
rebelled, and the powerful baldheaded Count Gert
marched up from Holstein with an army of 11, 000
to quell them but was slain by a Jutlandic squire,
thus saving the Danes from the German rule they
so much dreaded, And when the North Jutland
peasants rebelled again in 1535, at the crowning
of King Christen III, some of his great-great-
grandfathers must have joined them and stood up
bravely to fight for what they believed to be right,
and must have suffered also when the new King's
army slaughtered most of the citizens in Aalborg,
as well as over 2, 000 Jutland peasants who had
rallied to make a last stand there, Jutland peasants
clung and died together, for there had always been
great fellowship among them through the ages,
There was little doubt in his mind either but that
various of his ancestors, over a period of almost
a thousand years, had fought nobly time and time
again, when calls came, in war after war to save
Jutland's neck, Slesvig, from the covetous Ger-
mans. (Christen's own son, young Christen, had
gone to battle in the recent war for this selfsame
reason -- 'twas a pity the Danes lost that one!)
Comparatively few in numbers, and never rich,
the Danish have waged, with desperate bravery,
wars far beyond their strength. Though they have
<span id="page-??"></span>

often lost, yet they have given stronger nations the
impression that it was best to leave them alone.
Yes, Christen the elder was mighty proud of his
forebearers, those stalwart peasant Danes from
Thy. He was grateful too for the part they had
played in building and preserving the kingdom.

It would have been easy to have failed in the
era and circumstances into which Christen found
himself plunged at birth, which was just three
years following the close of Napoleon's great ram-
page in Europe, that left so many of the countries
there upset. The Danish Kingdom herself had
been thrown into a state of discouragement, She
was bankrupt and had lost the control of Norway
besides; but above all she had lost her great Dano-
Norwegian merchant fleet, second largest in the
world, next to England's, In fact, the country was
then regarded as being utterly impoverished and
on the verge of disintegration, It was in this
austere national atmosphere of disappointment and
soberness then that he grew up. Reconstruction
proceeded but slowly at first, general conditions
were extremely poor and throughout the land
things seemed to be at a standstill,

The Absolute Monarch, Frederick II, was
ruling in Denmark at this time, He had likely
made many wrong decisions, for he was not genius
enough to be able to keep on top of things during
that Napoleonic whirlwind, but his integrity was
beyond question and besides he was dearly beloved,
particularly by the peasants of his kingdom, for
the reforms he had brought about in the earlier
years of his reign in their behalf. At the age of
15, each Danishman became liable for military
service and could be called to serve in the King's
army or navy anytime between ages 15 and 39. If
there was war in Denmark no physically able male
in this age bracket got out of it, unless perhaps he
could hire someone to fight for him. In peacetime
one might ''draw a pass'' when there was no great
demand for soldiers, The law still remained that
all males be placed on the military levying rolls
at birth (at least until 1850), but Frederick VI did
away with the ''bound-to-the-soil' law and from
that time forth peasants could live anywhere they
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobbe rod 136

liked, At the same time it was decreed by him
that peasants could once again buy and own their
own farms and land, (This was a great step for-
ward, for they had been deprived of this freeman
privilege of owning property since the days of,
King Christian II, having been forced since that
time to either rent their lands and pay manorial
dues in money, crops and labor to the nobles,
church or State, or labor entirely on the large
estates of these great landowners.) Agriculture
was given a lift in the country through the intro-
duction of improved methods of cultivation, new
farm implements and better ploughs.

Christen Christensen, the father of the family,
had good reasons to be proud in his own right,
aside from the accomplishments of his ancestors;
for he himself was no ordinary fellow. He had
been brought up in the era "after Napoleon" ina .
Danish household of modest demands and thriftiness.
Likely he attended school at the parish town of Ydby
in winters, from age eight to twelve inclusive,
walking to and fro for that purpose in all sorts of
weather, In summers he must have helped on the
farm his father had been able to take over from
his father, When he was two months short of his
fifteenth birthday and the ''age of fighting'', so to
speak, his father, also named Christen Christensen,
had passed away nine days following his forty-third
birthday (1832) and, being the eldest child, Christen
had taken over the family farm, as well as the
support of his mother Maren and the younger
children:-- Karen, age eleven; Jens Christian,
eight and a half; Marie, age six; and Anne, just
past three years four months, Anne's twin, Maren,
had died soon after birth, January 1829, and the
boy Peder at age eleven, 1830, there having been
seven children in the family in all.

It is doubtful if Christen himself was called
into military service, either in his teens or
twenties, the country being at peace during those
years and the king being anxious to build up Danish
farms and agriculture again, He must have grieved
with other Danish peasants when old Frederick VI
died, in 1839, and been somewhat dubious as well
<span id="page-??"></span>
137 Kobberod

when the old king's cousin became King Christian
VIII, for he was middle-aged and had little fore-
Sight. Christen apparently hadn't thought much
about marriage, or at least hadn't done anything
about it, until sometime after his twenty-seventh
birthday, But then he courted and won the hand
of the lovely Karen Lauritzen, youngest daughter
of the widow Marianne Jeppesen of the town of
Gettrup nearby. On 25 March 1845, when he
lacked four months of being twenty-eight and
Karen was eighteen and a half, the two were
married in the Parish Church at Gettrup, soon
after their engagement intentions had been duly .
advertised by the Pastor there. Christen must
have sold or given up the family farm to his
younger and only living brother, Jens Christian,
then or soon after, for he took his bride to live
in the village of Kobberod, some five miles from
Flarup and half of that from Gettrup. Jens stayed
on in Flarup and likely ran the family farm and
kept a home for his mother and sisters, and sub-
sequently married a widow lady there, Christen
and Karen both had relatives in Kobberod and so
he bought a farm there and settled, He had built
that farm until it had become one of the richest
and best in the whole area and he was considered
one of the most successful farmers around, He
employed a number of laborers, both on the farm
and in the house, Aside from this he manufactured
farm implements on his place, for which he had
good market, He was a lover of thoroughbred
horses and owned a number, as well as his own
up-to-date and impressive carriage. He loved
sports and was a fine wrestler and jumper, as -
well as being clever at horseshoes, He had
numerous friends and relatives in South Thy,
being well known and well respected withal. Yes,
Christen Christensen was a well-to-do, successful,
selfmade man, one might say, and besides had
fathered ten children and provided well for his
household.

The gentle Karen herself was a woman of
high intelligence and refinement, with a deep
spiritual nature, She had been born in Gettrup,
8 Sept. 1826, the youngest of the three children,
all daughters, born to Lauritz Jeppesen ,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobbe rod 138

(anglicized to Laurs Jepsen) and Marianne Eliza-
beth Kristensen Eskov (anglicized to Mariane
Christensen), (Eskov was the name of the place
from whence her great-great paternal grandfather,
Peder Sorensen, had originated, having been born
there around 1678.) Her father's progenitors had
lived right there in the area of Gettrup for more
than two centuries at least, for there was a record
of them back to her fourth great-grandparents,
Eric Nielsen and his wife Mette Jensen Nielsen,
who were each born in Kobberdgaard about 1604
and 1610 respectively. So Karen too must have
descended from the early Vikings of Thy and their
predecessors there. But Karen's mother's fore-
runners had not come from Thy, as far back as
they knew, but from across the Limfjord east and
south, where its waters had pushed themselves in
to form several smaller fjords and bays, including
Skive Fjord. It was here on the shores of Skive
Fjord in the large city of Skive that her mother
had been born, the youngest of the four daughters
of Kristen Kristensen (Eschou) and Pouline
Kasgaard. Kristen's people were from Selde,
some ten miles or so north from there but had
originally come from the village of Escou (Eskou
or Eskuer) midway between Selde and Skive.
Pouline Kasgaard may have been from Skive, in
Skive Parish, but there is reason to believe she
was from much farther south, in Viborg, since
the first three of her four daughters had been born
there, only the fourth, Karen's mother Marianne,
having been born in Skive, It was from the cathe-
dral city of Viborg, that ancient cultural center in
mid-Jutland, that Jutland's royal army had ridden,
from time immemorial, southward by horse and
cart, to Denmark's ancient border near Danevirke
to fight off the Germans, (Where the modern high-
way has not replaced the old road, cart tracks
dating back several centuries may still be traced
in the heather and near the fjords, )

On 8 Dec, 1843, when Karen was just two
months past her seventeenth birthday, her father
died at age sixty-five years nine months, leaving
her mother, herself and her two older sisters, |
Maren, just a week past twenty-one and Ane,
nineteen and a half. In less than a year-and-a-half
<span id="page-??"></span>
139 Kobberod

after his death all three of the girls had married:--
Maren, 20 Oct, 1844 to Niels Thomsen; Ane, 2 Mar,
1845 to Poul Jensen; and Karen, two and-a-half
weeks after Ane, 25 Mar, 1845 to Christen Chris-
tensen of Flarup. All three couples were married
in the Parish Church in Gettrup and, strange as it
may seem, all took up their first residence in
Kobberod, although Ane and her husband later
moved to Hellerslev, nearby. The girls' mother
more than likely moved to Kobberod too and took |
turns living with her daughters, although she must
have spent most of her time with her youngest,
Karen, because she needed her the most. Maren
only had one son, young Christen's age, while

Ane had two girls and two boys but lost the first
girl soon after birth. ;

Karen's mother must have been with her
when her first five babies were born, and also
there to give aid and comfort when wee Ane
Marie had died, the first child to leave the nest,
Bedstemd¢der Marianne herself had been the next
one to go, passing away just seven months after
her tiny granddaughter, 25 Mar, 1852, which
happened to be Karen's and Christen's seventh
wedding anniversary. They had the church bell
tolled for her, and the funeral and the '"'dirt cast-
ing'', and laid her beside her husband Lauritz in —
the churchyard at Gettrup where they had so
recently placed little Ane. Marie to rest, There
were so many of their kindred at rest there in
that Gettrup Parish churchyard, and more to
come, It was Karen's uncle, the widower Peder
Jeppesen, a brother of her father, who had taken
his place there next, having died just a month
after Marianne. Then one by one, within the next
few years, three more of Karen's babies had been
buried in that same burial ground. It wasn't long
before the newer graves had hedges growing all
around, with flowers blooming inside in summers
like all the others; mute evidence that. love, birth
and death, the tapestry of life,. is little altered,
in the main, no matter when or where its threads
are woven, But death had seemed to strike so
often there then. It was small comfort that the |
churchyards were sometimes far more beautiful
than parks, with their white churches hovering
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobbe rod 140

above the flower-grown graves, their bell towers
always facing west toward the setting sun; for
what hope did these churches and their priests
offer the bereaved? ''From dirt thou camest and
to dirt thou returnest'' were the words spoken by
those who cast the "holy dirt"! into the tombs,

This Christensen family had always attended
the Parish church at Gettrup, the gentle Karen
having been very particular about church going,
as her mother Marianne had been before her, The
births and baptisms of each of her children had been
duly acknowledged and registered by the Priest
there, all except little Niels Christian who had
died in his sins right away before there had been’
time to have him ''dobt'’", This had been a canker-
ing sorrow to the family ever since, but especially
to the gentle Karen whose grief at the time had been
pitiful indeed, They had done everything they
could to make amends: for this neglect, The little
dead ones had all been buried in the churchyard ©
there, as mentioned, and the three older ones,
Christen, Laurs and Maren, had each received
their confirmations in the church there, in their
turns, as had-Karen and her sisters done in theirs,
The family as a whole had been very faithful in the
church attendance on ''Holy Days" at Easters and
Christmases and even regular services and masses,
Christen himself had contributed consistently to
the upkeep of the Parish, as well as the salary of
the priest. Karen read and studied her Bible often
and had become somewhat acquainted with the
scriptures, The-church congregations in Gettrup
were usually made up mostly of the Christensen's
relatives and friends, but few were as religious as
they, especially as Karen, for she herself was a
most devout Lutheran.

The education of the Christensen children
had not been neglected either, Christen, Laurs
and Maren had each attended the free church-
sponsored school provided in their area, from
ages eight through twelve as the law required.
Their father, a self-made man himself, had likely
considered that enough formal education for them,
believing more in the value of practical experience
and honest toil as an educator, Although he often
<span id="page-??"></span>
14] Kobberod

employed farm hands and maidservants, especially
in later years, yet he had insisted on the boys
working on the farm and Maren in the house,

Karen had sincerely tried to teach her children
something of the great art of living she herself

had learned so well:--courtesy, refinement,
mastery of self and the means of life about them,
enjoyment of simple things and appreciation for

all that was good,

The daughter Pouline had also started school
when she was eight but dropped out the forepart of
her second year, at Yuletide. Now Danish officials
were determined that there would be no illiteracy
in the country, yet it was permissable for children
to remain away from school if good enough reasons
could be found, Ifa child were sickly, or needed
by the parents in the home, or if the distance were
too far to school or the weather too rough, one
could remain at home during the school term pro-
vided arrangements could be made for him or her
to be properly taught in the home. What excuse
the Christensens gave for Pouline's absence from
the school is uncertain; perhaps it was the weather,
or again it may have been the fact that there was
already a governess employed in the home, How-
ever, the real crux of the matter was that they had
removed their daughter from the State school to
save her from possible embarrassment or harsh
treatment there, since it had lately been rumored
about the area that the Christensens were ''Mormon
lovers",

It had all started to happen when the gentle
Karen, in her sweet way, had opened the door to
two Mormon missionaries and let them in out of
the cold. That they had been kinder to her than
she to them that day she had scarcely realized,
yet they had warmed her heart with the beauty of
the Restored Gospel. Being much impressed with
their words she had invited the Elders to return.
Meantime she had taken to studying her Bible
more in order to determine if the words they had
spoken were true. She told Christen about their
visit, insisting that what the Mormon missionaries
had said agreed with the scriptures yet disagreed
with what the priest had told his congreations.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 142

Her husband had taken little stock in the affair to
begin with, but made no objection to the Elders
coming if she wished it, though he knew somewhat
of the reputation of the Mormons, He was one to
pamper his wife, and besides he trusted Karen's
judgment,

On their next visit the Elders brought with
them the ''new Bible'' or Book of Mormon, and left
it with her, She had started to read then and hardly
put the book down for days until she had read it
through. Her soul burned with a knowledge of the
truth of it, as she poured over its pages, and she
rejoiced, There was one section in the last of the
book that astonished her perhaps more than any
other and she re-read it carefully, over and over:--
Moroni 8:11-21'"',,. little children need no repent-
ance, neither baptism...'' (She skipped some here
and there.) ''Behold I say unto you, that he that
supposeth that little children need baptism is in
the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity...
For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God
saveth one child because of baptism, and the other
must perish because he has no baptism. Little
children cannot repent,., And he that saith that
little children need baptism denieth the mercies
of Christ... Woe unto such, for they are in danger
of death, hell and an endless torment, I speak it
boldly; God hath commanded me -- listen -- and
give heed..,'' As Karen read these things she
cried out with happiness, ''Our little Niels -- the
priest was wrong - wrong!'' And she knew it
fully then,

It had taken only a few more visits and dis-
cussions with the Elders until Karen had known she
was ready for baptism by immersion, as the Lord
had commanded, However, though she pressed
them for it then eagerly, the missionaries had no
desire to break up that lovely family with a lone
baptism; so, as the weeks passed, they began
more and more to involve the whole Christensen
family in their cottage meetings, with Karen's
help. All except the son Christen finally came
around to listen and discuss, but he would have
nothing at all to do with any ''Mormons!"' The
daughter Maren soon became deeply impressed
<span id="page-??"></span>
143 Kobberod

also, but whether it was so much with Mormonism
as with the handsome missionary, Elder Myrup,
was not quite clear, even to the young lady herself,
One could see that the son Laurs was somewhat
moved by it all, yet was being held back by his

- older brother's opinions, It is hard to stand
against ridicule when one is seventeen! Christen
the father seemed to have a lot of thinking to do
about the whole thing. Most Scandinavians who
were embracing the gospel in those days were
poor or meek, but this Dane was neither. The
little girls went about their own small affairs
knowing naught of the magnitude of the decisions
being made then in the home,

The Christensens had been without a gover-
ness for a number of weeks, their former one
having left in a huff when the Mormon missionaries
had begun to call at the farmhouse, Seemingly a
Mormon-hater, she had soon started some unkind
rumors about them in the village; doubtless falling
back on gossiping to seem important, having so
little in and of herself inthe world with which to
put that point over, like so many of her kind. The
word that her recent employers were ''Mormon
sympathizers" brought no immediate violence to .
the offenders, as she had likely anticipated. Cer-
tainly it was not like it had been in the area, and
not so long ago either, when quiet, hard-working,
honest farm families could be meeting with friends
and neighbors, singing and praying one minute and
the next facing a howling mob seemingly intent on
their extermination. The reaction then, in the
midst of that bitter winter, had more or less
taken on the form of vehement talking ''behind
backs", as it were. The usual rabble-rousers
used up their energy in virile, abusive words
against them, telling what they would do ''come
spring'' perhaps, Some others of their friends
and neighbors scowled at them or shunned them,
and a number of their relatives who lived close by
ran right over to see what it was all about, and
when they learned, commenced to call them ''fools".
'Twas said the priest himself had plenty bad to say
of them, Perhaps he was worried about his pocket
money, since the family no longer joined his con-
gregations, Christen senior couldn't have cared
<span id="page-??"></span>

less what people said or how they reacted, though
he. was somewhat surprised at the bigotry of some
of the best of them. But if there was bitterness on
any side it could not hold a candle to the bitterness
of the weather, which continued to beat, bite and
bruise any flesh forced to be out in it for long. .And
so- matters had stood in. Kobberod when the new

The weather continued so through the rest of
February and all.of March that winter of 1865,
Notwithstanding, the two Mormon Elders continued
to labor faithfully with the Christensens and other
farm families in the area, visiting them often and
usually wading through heavy snow and enduring
severe cold to do so, They now had quite a num-
ber of sincere investigators and a few others, like
Karen and Maren, who were ready for baptism, ©
The importance and influence of the Christensens
had been quite a factor in bringing in investigators
who were pleased to follow their example and who
often came to meetings in their home. Baptisms:
in the open were impossible then, as the weather
stood, but the missionaries were looking forward
to spring when they hoped for quite a "harvest of
souls" in Gettrup Parish, Though they had
received no commitments from either Laurs
Christensen or his father, they felt they were
making progress, especially with the younger man,
The new Mormon governess there seemed to be
having quite an influence on his thinking.

Else Katherine Andersen was happy in the
Christensen home, at least as happy as one could
be under the circumstances of feeling quite for-
gotten by her own family, These people with whom
she now resided had treated her most kindly; in
fact she had been led to feel more like a member
of the family than.a servant. She had learned to
love the gentle Karen like a second mother, They
had much in common in their love for the gospel
and often studied and talked of it together. Else's

special charges, the three younger daughters,
were her delight. She had learned to love them
with all her heart, The shy Pouline had come to
trust her for she had done so much to encourage

the young girl in her special abilities. Trina had
been no problem from the first; she knew they
would be friends forever. The little one, Sena,
had to be weaned somewhat from her mother's
skirts and Else fell back on the stories of her
childhood to do this, for Sena loved stories and
jingles, ''Tommeltot fell in the water; Slikkepot
fished him out; Langemand carried him home;
Guldbrand put him to bed, and Lille Peder Spille-
mand sat in the corner and tattled.'' This one the
small girl learned to say, pulling at her own
fingers the while. When it was time for bed the
story about 'Ole Lukoie'' was what Sena coaxed
for and she usually got it, since nothing else
would quiet her. "Ole Lukoie comes up the stairs
in his stocking feet, opens the door noiselessly ---
and st! --- squirts a small, small stream of
sweet milk in the childrens' eyes to prevent them
from staying open. . ,. He creeps among them and
blows softly upon their necks. , , He doesn't hurt
them, for Ole is very fond of the children; he only
wants them to be quiet, . .'' By this time Sena
was most always sound asleep. As Else tended
and entertained the children, and as she taught
them their lessons, she also taught them about
the gospel, as her mistress, the gentle Karen,
had suggested. Someday they would be baptised
like she had been, in the deep water,

March passed and April came; these were
the months for birthdays in Norhaa -- Mors, Fars,
Christens, Karens and Mads, Mads had turned
twenty now, Else longed to hear from her family
but had received no word since coming to Kobberod,
although she had written right away to send her
address and tell of her circumstances, There had
been plenty of time in spite of delayed mails, She
hid her disappointme nt deep and went ahead with
her work, The weather was warming at last and
the Christensen men were preparing for their
planting, Mr. Christensen she greatly admired,
he was aman of strong character, Else trusted -
him and felt he did so with her. The son Laurs
she had grown fond of for he was so full of wit and
humor and such good company; besides he was
becoming continually more sympathetic with the
gospel teachings, as they discussed them, In all
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobbe rod 146

but that he seemed much like her brother Mads,
The older daughter, Maren, had kept her distance,
as she could, seeming to be jealous of the apparent
friendliness between Else and the missionaries,
especially Elder Myrup. But had he not been the
one to get Else this position? She kept well her
secret that she knew about Elder Myrup and his
hopes for Maren, as mentioned in his letter to
Elder Hansen. The antagonistic son Christen
bothered her, yet she pitied him -- perhaps the
war had made him that way; he had been young to
go a-fighting - just like Mads, This one had so ©
much happiness within his grasp but wouldn't see
it. He constantly complained of everything, includ-
ing the farm work, He wished to try his hand at a
craft or trade, 'twas far better than working ona
farm for a miserable salary, he said. He was
handy at the making of farm implements, like his
father, but disliked that too, He wanted to be off,
that was the truth of it. There were many traveling
craftsmen, tradesmen and salesmen in the area,
and when the sun shone they came out like house-
flies, plying their crafts and trades and making
tolerable good businesses at them too, There
were watchmakers, carpenters, shoemakers,
harness and wagon makers, roof thatchers,
salesmen of tin goods and lighographs, mechanics,
etc., and even dressmakers and tailors, going
from house to house and door to door peddling
their wares and services.

Kobberod was situated near the meandering
Limfjord, where an arm of it came twining itself
through the land there in south Thy, reaching out
northwesterly towards the sea and carressing
green or sandy shores of bays, coves, inlets and
smaller fjords on its way. On the fjord's east
bank, midway between the waters of Fjordgrund
and Kirk Vig, the village itself lay looking across
ten miles or so to Thyboron Harbor, or south to
Nissum Bay inthe distance, Here in this large
and beautiful bay, Viking fleets and their fearless
crews had gathered from north, south and east ten
centuries before to await their devastating raids
west across the North Sea, And farther northwest

from Kobberod, on past Kirk Vig to the shores of
this rough sea, near Aggerborg, can still be seen
excavations from whence those early sea-kings
once set forth in their long-ships. A fjord town or
village on the shores of the Limfjord, such as_
Kobberod, was a lovely place to be in the spring-
time. Picture looking out towards Nissum Bay
and seeing the sky reflected in enchanting pastel:
colors in its blue waters, while crafts of all
descriptions glide to and fro.upon its surface,
from small open fishing boats being rowed along

to large sailing vessels with their giant white sails
spread and their blur of red and: white flags flapping
inthe brisk breeze, Imagine herring nets billow-
ing against the blue sky between weathe rbeaten ..
posts of silver grey, flights of birds wheeling, |
dipping and circling in a water ballet, and far off
on the very brink of heaven, flocks of plump little
fleecy white: clouds, like lambs grazing. :

Here were smokehouses dotted along the
green sloping shores, Danes were fond of smoked
herring, In fact, most Danes were fond of fish of
any kind, fish having fed their ancestors since the
beginning - far longer than farms had, There
were numerous fishermen in the vicinity of.
Kobberod and many there who loved the sea. It
was often said, jokingly, that the children‘in this
area were born with oars in their hands, Not all
here, however, were sea-going Danes, for ‘there
were some, like the Christensens, who were pro-
verbially reluctant to sail.out farther than they
could row back, For though they loved the water
and had been raised to the rhythmic sound of its
splashing, yet they much preferred having their
feet firmly planted on solid t ground, being land-. .
Danes, as it were. pa

Many farms were scattered about, ‘for
Kobberod was primarily a village of farms,
varying in size. A Danish farmyard could’ be ae
very picturesque place. The house and ac company -
ing farm buildings were usually built around a °
courtyard in a sort of U shape, in the center of:

_ which would likely be a tall flagpole, watering

trough, water pump, and possibly a windmill.

smokehouse, corral and sheds, as well as the
dwelling itself, would all be built in the country's
own products -- grey stone, clay, forest wood and
straw. The half-timbered farmhouse itself might
boast a modern red tile roof, but the other buildings
would all be thatched with straw, The individual
farm largely supplied the food requirements of
the family, outside of fish, salt, coffee, tea and
some fruits, Cereal, root crops, potatoes, oats,
barley and wheat were raised in abundance, as
well as garden vegetables, berries, currants,
prunes, rhubarb, etc. Some Danes even grew
trees whose leaves were edible, such as the
Bégetrae whose branches were picked in the spring
and placed in vases inthe homes, Cattle, pigs,
sheep, chickens, ducks and geese and the like,
provided meat aplenty, as well as eggs, lard,
bacon, cheese and butter, <A favorite with some.
Danes was clabber milk, or "thick milk" as they
called it. Good cooks were the rule in most farm
homes and farmers and their families, like most
other Danes, were generally well fed. Some of
the materials for clothing, such as leather and
wool, were raised on the farm also and most
everything the family wore was made there, with
the aid of traveling shoemakers, dressmakers,
tailors, etc. Danish peasants or farm people
were always well clothed, if not fashionably, but
they could dress up as gaily as the best, in their
‘national costumes'' if the occasion required it.

The Danes themselves were a fine race,
usually tall and athletically trained. In the country
districts, such as Thy, they were kind and hospit-
able with an easy independence of bearing. The
natives of Thy, perhaps the harshest part of Den-
mark, were possibly more hardy and vigorous, in
the main, because of the process of natural
selection, the weaker ones dying off young,

Jutland in general was sometimes referred to as
the ''dark continent", particularly by Danes of the
Island cities. This was probably because of the —
seeming backwardness of its people, the country
manner and country dress, including wooden shoes,
but more especially because of the peculiar Danish
brogue spoken in parts such as Thy -- ''Danish
words all chewed up and swallowed and then spit

out of the throat'', and sounding almost as harsh
as the land was itself. But in spite of it all, the
blood of Israel, and some of the finest blood in

the kingdom of Denmark, flowed in the veins of
the farming Jutlanders of Thy. Among these, and
surely not the least of them, were the Christen
Christensens of Kobberod, In fact, to many of

the people of this area Christen Christensen
himself was known as ''the great man of the north',

News from other parts of the world came to
Kobberod through the Danish newspapers, letters
from emigrants and other world travelers, and
from returning seamen, It must have been noted
with interest there, as elsewhere in Europe, that
the great American Civil War--a terrible internal
struggle--which had been raging for more than
three years had been finally brought to a close,

On 9th April, that spring of 1865, the Confederate
General Robert E, Lee surrendered to the Union
forces under General Ulysses S, Grant. With this
the famous American President, Abraham Lincoln,
had not only freed the black slaves of his country
but had preserved the Union as well. There was
genuine rejoicing at this, not only in the United
States but in other countries, including Denmark,
However, five days later, the night of April 14th,
in the midst of the joyful celebrations in the Ameri-
can capitol city of Washington, D. C., while
Lincoln was attending the theatre there, he was
shot and killed by an assassin, John Wilkes Booth,
The happiness of the world at this outstanding man's
successes turned as suddenly to sorrow at his
death. Robert Ingersoll wrote of the great
emancipator, Abraham Lincoln:-- ''He was the
courage, the hope and the nobility of a nation. He
knew no fear except the fear of wrong doing,
Wealth could not purchase, power could not awe
this divine - this loving man, It is the glory of
Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he.
never abused it except on the side of mercy,."'!

The famous story teller of Denmark, Hans
Christian Andersen, was a contemporary of
Abraham Lincoln and so was Christen Christensen
of Kobberod, All lived at a time when great things
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 150

were happening in the world and important decisions
were being made.

Seventeen days following the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln, while the world still mourned
his passing, an event took place near Kobberod,
Denmark, which was to change the lives of many
people. On May Ist, 1865 a small group of Danish
people wended their way down a green sloping bank
to a cove of water which had stolen away from the
main body of the Limfjord into a nook of the land
there. Here it lay, sheltered from the wind and
prying eyes, sunning itself, Among the group who
came to disturb its placid waters that beautiful
spring day were all of the members of the Chris-
tensen family of Kobberod, except the eldest son
Christen, their governess, Else K, Andersen, the
missionary Lars N. C. Myrup and his companion,
and several others who had come, like the rest,
either as spectators or for baptism. Two of the
Christensen family were prepared to enter the
waters of baptism that day: the mother, Karen
Lauritzen Christensen and the eldest daughter
Maren, Karen was eager to be first for she had
waited so long for that precious moment when she
could become a real member of the L, D, S.
church, She was baptized and then confirmed by
Elder Myrup, assisted by his missionary com-
panion, Maren came next and it was also Elder
Myrup who baptized and confirmed her a member,
Others from the small congregation assembled
there on the banks of the cove were also baptized
and confirmed, and then the simple services were
ended, The gentle Karen had been given one of her
greatest desires in life, yet she was grieved because
her husband and her sons had failed to be baptized
that day.

Christen senior had been seriously consider-
ing the step for quite a while, In fact the urge to
be baptized had kept yanking at his coattails for
weeks but his Danish stubbornness had kept holding
him back, Why hadn't he thought of the whole thing
first? The night following his wife's baptism, as
he and she were preparing to retire, Karen spoke
to him of the great peace that had come into her
heart with the administration of those holy
<span id="page-??"></span>
151 Kobberod

ordinances, and then she said, rather wistfully,.--
"But it will be so difficult to emigrate to Zion
without you, my love.'' These last words stunned
him - that was something else he hadn't thought
about first either, Well now if this was how the
wind was blowing it was a different matter entirely!
Next day Christen made a special visit to the
lodgings of the Mormon missionaries, and the
following day, May 3rd 1865, accompanied by the
two delighted Elders, he himself went down to the
water and was baptized and confirmed a member

of the new church by Elder Myrup, assisted by the
other Elder, Five days later, 8 May 1865, another
baptism session was held in the cove near Kobberod
and the son Laurs (Lauritz Mathias Christian
Christensen) and the daughter Pouline were bap-
tized and confirmed members by Elder Lars
‘Myrup, assisted by his companion, together with

a few other investigators from Gettrup Parish.
With this the gentle Karen's cup of joy was

almost overflowing. But there was still the son
Christen, whose bitterness for the Mormons was
growing steadily -- yet a mother's heart never
gives up!

One could say this much for the father,
Christen Christensen of Kobberod: whenever he
went into something he went in all over! As far
as he was concerned, from the moment of his
baptism and as long as he lived, nothing was too —
good for the Restored Church and its missionaries,
Right away he helped to secure a rented hall in the
town of Gettrup where the few members of the ©
church in the area could hold services, He and
his family attended regularly and assisted in
fellowshipping new members by inviting them to
their home. They fed and entertained the mission-
aries and did everything they could to further the
work of the Lord in that small part of His vineyard.
It wasn't long before a goodly part of the dis-
cussions at the meetings were about emigration.
The Millennial Star, an LDS church publication
printed in England but translated into Danish,
carried this message:-- ''The poor, the pure in
heart will be brought singing to Zion. . . let all
who can procure a loaf of bread and one garment
on their backs be assured there is water plenty
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 152

and pure by the way. And doubt no longer but come
next year to the place of gathering, even in flocks,
as doves fly to their window before the storm."
"Eimigration' -- this was a magic word now for
these new Saints; to Zion they must surely go -
next year!

The seasons moved ahead, Nightingales sang
in the long evenings of late spring - a choir of
innumerable, invisible musicians, At midsummer
the cool waves of the Limfjord and its numerous
water-relatives, and the various bathing beaches
dotting their shores, attracted vacationers, bathers
and boaters, In late summer and early autumn the
heather began blooming. And then it was harvest
time again, There was a bountiful one in Kobberod
and all hands were called outside to help with it.
Even the maidservants at the Christensens, includ-
ing Else, were put to harvesting the crops. This
would mean more money all around for emigrating,
for by now it had been pretty well agreed that all
who desired it would go to America the following
spring. Elder Myrup would be going, as well as
Else, and of course the whole Christensen family
except Christen Jr.

By now Else was receiving regular mail from
home, from Mads and the girls, but not one written
word had she from her parents, It was all the same
small talk as usual, avoiding’ the fact that they were
living in two separate worlds of believing. All were
well at home, they said, except Christen, who was
poorly. The warm weather had brought Stine out
of her ailment and she was blooming like a rose
again, Neither she or Karen, however, had suitors
yet. Marie was plumper than ever, Mor and Far
were still very much upset with her and ashamed
‘for her also, though they seemed to expect her back
most any day, disillusioned, and ready to make
amends for her sins, and her peace with the priest,
Rumor had it that Rudolph would soon marry a girl
from Kobenhaven and settle down there, There were
always plenty of good wishes and much love included
at the end, and sometimes a P,S, -- ''By the way,
when are you coming back home?" So they thought
it was just a little fling she was having. Perhaps
she would never go back, But oh to link arms with
<span id="page-??"></span>
153 Kobberod

them again - to talk the way they had before - to
sit together on the bench beside the door and watch
the moon come up, and listen to the cry of the
nightingale !

In November and December the wind was
howling cold again, In the Christensen household
every extra moment was being directed towards
the goal of emigration, Instructions had been
received from the Branch headquarters at Aalborg.
It would be no simple matter to go from one life to
another; to cross an ocean and a vast continent -
to leave ''Babylon' for the 'Kingdom of God"

Six or seven months would be required, ''Convert
everything possible into cash", the authorities
advised; so Christen began disposing of his stock,
No use feeding more than necessary through the
winter; the hay and grain saved would bring a good
price. 'Be frugal and thrifty and save as much as
you can toward leaner days'' was suggested; so
Karen watched the kitchen and the cooking more
closely. Left-overs and scraps were good for
sauces and soup stocks; fish balls in soup were
cheaper than meat balls, and just as nourishing.
Some of the help was dismissed but a sewing lady
was engaged to come into the home and get started
on wardrobes for the family. Maren herseif was
already an excellent little seamstress and made
many of her own things, Her clothes were always
just a little better than the ordinary. Sorting began;
so much would have to be left behind, since the
usual emigrant equipment was supposed to average
not more than one hundred pounds per person,
There would be no room for the unnecessaries

and little, if any, for family keepsakes and trea-
sures, They were cautioned to bring along a year's
supply of clothing, if possible, Costumes for
sailing would differ from those that should be |
worn on desert trails and in the valleys of the
mountains, Food would be supplied or could be:
purchased along the way.

It was a custom in Denmark at this time for
the family farm to be passed down from father to
eldest son, Young Christen would have been in
line to inherit the Christensen property, had all
been as usual; but it was now necessary that the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 154

holdings be sold to assure emigration funds for the
rest of the family. So Christen senior began
casting about for a possible buyer for his land.
Ready money was needed right away, because all
who planned to emigrate were required to make
deposits for their ship passages and railway
tickets well in advance, in order that arrangements
could be made with authorities both in Denmark and
America, The fare from Copenhagen, Denmark,
to Wyoming, Nebraska, U.S.A., the outfitting
place for the Saints who were to cross the plains

in 1866, was about 82 Danish rigsdaler or $42.00
in American money for each adult person, Child-
ren could travel for half fare, This meant that
transportation for the Christensen family for this
part of the journey alone would cost around 440
rigsdaler. Else would be required to pay at least
80 rigsdaler.in advance, The trip to Aalborg and
from thence to Copenhagen would be extra and there
would be money needed for supplies at Wyoming,

as well as plenty to defray incidental expenses
along the way. Christen Christensen was blessed
in being a man of some means; most planning to
emigrate were much, much less fortunate.

Besides the physical preparations for the
going-away, there were moral and spiritual details
to be looked after - the ''Word of Wisdom!" for
instance, Snaps and tobacco were not difficult for
the Christensen men to give up, once they put their
minds to it, but tea and coffee were another matter.
It was hard for Scandinavians to get along without
their coffee. The hours of the day could be counted
by the number of cups of coffee served in a Danish
household, The old black coffeepot stood enshrined
on the back of every kitchen stove, always filled
with the hot beverage, ready for pouring. The
early church authorities were somewhat lenient
with the Saints of the northland where coffee was
concerned, for this habit seemed to be such an
intrinsical part of their lives, When the pure, cool
drinking water of Zion could be substituted, it
would be time enough for them to change.

Christmas was a wonderful time for the
Christensens and members of their household that
year, There was genuine thanksgiving and rejoicing
<span id="page-??"></span>
155 Kobberod

among them, for all were filled with great hopes
for the future, fully expecting to see the land of
America and the Great Salt Lake before another
Yuletide, Nothing was spared of jollity and good
will, Friends and relatives from all around called
in for the celebration, for word had been spread
that this would be the Christensens last Yule in
Denmark, If any guests were disappointed at the
absence of pipe and bowl -- too bad -- it was the
Mormon way. There was love and friendship and
tasty food enough for everyone - and coffee too,
And there was dancing and singing and well-
wishing, Christen himself was the best of dancers,
as were the son Laurs and Elder Myrup too, If
any visitors were shocked upon seeing a Mormon
priest kick up his heels - well - too bad again!

Especially gay that holiday time was the
daughter Maren, for she had just been spoken for
by the missionary, Lars Myrup. There were con-
gratulations all around, Her parents were delighted,
they could have hoped for nothing better than that
their eldest girl should wed the beloved Elder who
had brought them all into the true church. It was
agreed that their marriage should take place at
Aalborg, prior to them all leaving for Zion in the
spring, The last thing in the world the couple
wanted was a marriage in the Parish church at
Gettrup; the priest there should be cheated of that.
Lars Myrup was nearly four years Maren's senior,
she being six weeks short of seventeen while he
was lacking three months of twenty-one, but every-
one agreed they made a handsome pair, Else also
was pleased for Maren and, when they had a moment
along together, confided in the younger girl that
once, when she herself was seventeen, she too had
dreamed of marrying a good and kind missionary.
She then told Maren about the letter Elder Myrup
had sent to Elder Hansen, nearly a year before,
in which he had told of having his eyes set on the
eldest Christensen daughter even then, At this
the wide-eyed girl flung her arms round Else and
kissed her impetuously, Then she had known it
all along, had the sly governess;-and they both
laughed merrily together, as girls sharing
secrets sometimes do,
<span id="page-??"></span>

It was necessary for Lars Myrup to leave the
Kobberod area soon after Yuletide and return to his
home in Myrupgaard, Lild Parish, in far north
Thisted Amt. There were arrangements for him
to make and the ''where with'' to be secured for his
marriage and emigration. He would travel first to
Aalborg to be relieved of his missionary responsi-
bilities and also to sign up for emigration,

Christen asked him if, while he was there at Branch
headquarters, he would also declare the Christen-
sens! intentions of going, Then he entrusted his
future son-in-law with 170 rigsdaler to deposit in
partial payment for their passages, promising that
the balance required would be forthcoming in a few
more weeks, Before saying his goodbys, Elder
Myrup took his future brother-in-law, Laurs, aside
for a bit of private conversation and advice, The
burden of his words concerned marriage, as one
might have supposed, but not his and Marens alone
but the younger man's as well. ''Why not marry
Else?" he said, "'she will make someone an
excellent wife - why not you?'' Laurs put in that
this might require some thinking! 'The four of us
could honeymoon together on our way to Zion - 'tis
far better that you take a Danish wife along than to
have some foreigner set her trap for you in Zion",
Myrup continued, 'Ja, perhaps so'' Laurs answered,
"Else is a strong girl and she could pull me across
the plains in a handcart, if needs be - Ja, ja, there
would be some advantage in that!" Trust Laurs to
always make a joke, ‘Well, work on it'', said the
Elder as they parted.

That turned out to be a rather mild winter
compared to the previous one, The forepart of
February, Christen senior set out in his wagon for
Aalborg to finish paying his deposit, exchange some
Danish rigsdaler into American money, and get the
general lay-of-the-land there. By strict economy,
Else had been able to save enough from her wages
for her to give her employer 80 rigsdaler to deposit
for her also. A couple of other new Mormon bre-
thren went along with him for the same reasons,
"The Aalborg Conference Emigration List of 1866"
carried the following entries: Christen Christensen,
age 48, born Flarup, occupation farmer, nationality
Dane; Karen, 39, Kobert, wife, Dane; Lars M. C.,
<span id="page-??"></span>
157 Kobberod

18, Kobert, son, Dane; Maren, 16, Kobert, daugh-
ter, Dane; Pouline, 95, Kobert, Dane; Petrine, 7,
Kobert, Dane; Nielsine, 4, Kobert, Dane, (Some
mistakes are here noted since Karen was bornin
Gettrup, not ''Kobert'' (misspelling of Kobberod);
Maren was a few days of 17, not 16, and Pouline
was past 103, not 95. (It is probable that Christen,
like many fathers, could not remember the ages of
his own daughters.) The entry on the list directly
below that of the Christensens was for Else Kath-
rine Andersen, 19, born Hvidburg, spinster, Dane,
and then opposite her name, in the ''deposited"
column, appeared the number 80. .(We know Else
was born in Kjallerup, Hvidburg Parish.) In the
"deposited'' column opposite Christen Christensen's
name appeared the figures 440 - 170 - 270, and
farther over under the ''exchange'! column appeared
the figures 800 - 19 = 819. Inthe "foreign coin!"
column was listed "paid 410.00", . This has been
interpreted to mean that Christen Christensen
deposited 270 rigsdaler, plus the 170 previously
paid, or a total of 440 rigsdaler, for his and his
family's passage and railway tickets to ''Wyoming"
(listed under the ''remarks'' column.) 80 rigsdaler
were deposited in Else's name. Christen also
must have exchanged 819 Danish dollars for $410
in American money, and we are led to believe this
money was in gold coins, It was perhaps while
Christen was in Aalborg then that he was approached
on the subject of contributing to the "Church Immi-
gration Fund", This was a fund which had pre-
viously been set up by the brethren in Salt Lake
City, from which needy Saints could borrow for
their emigration passage to Zion. Members with
extra means, both in Utah and in the Missions,
were asked to contribute to this fund, We have
been told that our Christen Christensen was one

of the generous ones in the Aalborg Conference,
where the emigration of the Saints was concerned,

In the meantime, in Kobberod, Laurs had
made up his mind about something, but he was
having some difficulty in knowing just how to go
about it. Since his older brother Christen had
now taken off on his own and his father was gone
for a time, he himself, being the only man of the
family about, had much to do, inside and out, He
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobbe rod 158

had a mind to spend some time with the governess,
Else, but it seemed impossible to find her alone.
She had wonderful energy and was so enthusiastic
and helpful that she was in constant demand by
someone or other in the Christensen household.
His mother, the gentle Karen, leaned on this girl
more and more, as it became apparent that she
was going to have another little one. How could he
compete with his own mother and four sisters for
the attention of one they all depended on so much?
What chance had a lone man in a household of
women, especially where any private courting

was concerned? -

Christen senior returned from Aalborg and
he too had a job for Else. He would trust it with
no one else but her, since his dear wife was then
too ill to help him. Would Else make hima special
lining for his waistcoat? This she would gladly do,
she said, and she gave no thought to the big task it
might be for it sounded simple enough in the asking.
This must be kept a secret thing, her employer
said, done after most others of the household had
gone off to bed, ‘Twas the strangest hand sewing
Else had ever done, Into each small section of the
newly made vest lining was to be placed a gold coin
and sewn all around; which turned out to be a tre-
mendous job. When Laurs offered to help - hand
her the coins or just anything - his father, sensing
something or other in the wind, withdrew in his
son's favor, And so at last Else and Laurs sat
there alone together, late into each night that it
took to complete the job; he, like old Midas of the
story, fingering the yellow gold and she sewing
round and round each piece as she put it in the
lining of Christen's vest, He spieled off jokes,
one after the other, in great style, with no trouble
at all; but when he tried to talk of the things nearest
his heart then, his tongue was tied. Else laughed
happily at each joke, but all the time she was
thinking how much she was drawn to this handsome
young fellow with curly hair like his father, and so
good and kind and unassuming, like his gentle
mother; yet somehow so very much like her
brother Mads, withal,

Else hadn't been able to bring herself to
<span id="page-??"></span>
159 Kobberod

write her family of her anticipated emigration.
Actually she planned somehow to go home and tell
them of it - and say goodby. As the time drew
nearer, however, she fled from the thought of it
more and more. How did one say goodby forever?
Yet, when all was said and done, did her activities
really matter very much anymore to those in
Norhaa? Occasionally the girl indulged herself in
moments of self-pity, but then she brushed these
aside by lifting up her voice in the songs of Zion, ©

or by quoting from Psalms, such as:-- "This is a
day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be
glad in it'', Then she was comforted and went

bravely ahead, losing herself in the happiness
and plans of others, and in their service,

Soon after the first part of March Else had
a letter from Mads, in which he told of Christen's
death in Norhaa, 29 February that year (1866).
He had suffered much, wrote her surviving brother,
and he also included these statements:-- ''Christen,
in his last days, was stirred to look inward into
‘his sinful heart and consider the Lord's goodness
to repentant sinners and whatever else there is to
believe in, Immediately afterwards, we other
brother and sisters came in touch with the same
way of life through a revival initiated by Grundt-
vig."' So, thought Else, they too,were searching -
for the truth perhaps. But they would never find
it with Grundtvig! Then thinking again of Christen,
she couldn't help but recall the old verse:

‘When the devil is ill, a monk he would be,
But when he is well, the devil is he,'"'.

Then at once she was ashamed and saddened and -
went outside by herself and wept.. Laurs followed
to give comfort and then they walked and talked.»
until they had made their way together to where“.
the land overlooked the water. There, in the’

distance where the winter's ice had given way, ©.
the flying shapes of ships appeared. They them->
selves would soon be sailing! , ait

We are left to our own imaginings as to just
where and when the important words were said
between these two. This being a leap-year, she
might have helped the young man out a bit and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 160

popped the question herself, had she known of the
custom, That Laurs M, C,. and Else K, fell in
love we can be certain, and that they planned to
be wed in Aalborg in the month of April is also
true, :

In anticipation of her marriage, Else now
wished for the lovely things in her brides-chest,
and even the chest itself, But the amount of
luggage allowed her on the voyage could scarcely
accommodate all the necessary things, let alone |
these, Then she wrote home to her parents to tell
of her future plans -- her marriage to come and.
her expected emigration to America, both to take
place within a month or so, She told them she _
lacked for nothing there in Kobberod since the
family of her betrothed had taken her to their
hearts like a favored daughter of their own. She
asked that her sisters be given the things in her
. brides-chest and all else of hers, between them;
she would have no room for any of these on the
ship. She offered condolence for poor Christen,
who had died a bachelor just short of twenty-seven.
She made no promise of a visit to Norhaa to bid
them goodby but she left the door open in hopes
her parents would invite her, should the chance
arise,

Christen Christensen sold his farm and
home stead in Kobberod for half its value, with the
stipulation that he and his household could remain
there until mid April, or the time of planting. He
sold the remainder of his crops and livestock as
well, with the exception of his choicest team of
horses, which he hoped to take along to Aalborg,
together with his fine carriage, and dispose of
them just before taking the ship. The rest of the
family effects they couldn't take with them they
arranged to sell or give away to relatives and
friends, Packing had been going on for some
time, in valises, bundles and boxes; and two large
trunks, for which they would have to pay an extra
shipping fee, were filled with all the family's best
wearing apparel, together with the few heirlooms
with which they were loathe to part. It was
necessary too for all adults of the family, as well
<span id="page-??"></span>
161 Kobberod

as Else, to visit the civil authorities there and
secure permission to leave Kobberod and have
the official stamp placed in each individual identi-
fication book, It was lucky for Laurs that his
request to leave came in peacetime, otherwise

he would have surely been denied it and put right
away in the king's army, Another few months
might have seen him in anyway, unless he had
been lucky enough to ''draw a pass",

The forepart of April the Christensens spent
much time visiting their relatives and friends to
say goodby, There were Karen's sisters, Maren
Thomsen and Ann Jensen and their families, and
Christen's brother, Jens C, Christensen, and his
three sisters, Karen, Marie and Anne, and their
families, Yes, there were a host of their relatives
all around the area, and friends galore, Many of
them expressed sorrow for them - that such a
promising family was being deceived by those
"wicked Mormons", They hoped that when they
found out their mistake they would return to "dear
old Denmark", However, some expressed fear
that the Mormons would kill them should they
attempt to get away, or that the Indians would
kill them if they stayed in this so-called "Zion",
They had heard that the redmen were on the war-
path there now and killing the settlers right and
left. As to their near relatives, none of them
seemed inclined to listen to their testimonies of
the Restored Gospel, although they bore them at
every opportunity, but rather looked upon them as
fools because they had joined so unpopular a sect
as the ''Mormons'', Some of their better-off
friends and relatives rejected the gospel because
they had too much of this world's goods, others
were not religiously inclined, and still others
loved the ways of the world too much to repent
of their sins and lead better lives,

One of the last places Christen and Karen
visited was the Parish churchyard at Gettrup,
where their four babies lay buried, as well as
Karen's parents and numerous relatives, . She
was especially nervous for fear the Lutheran
priest would come out and revile them or at
least forbid them to enter there; so they stayed

only briefly by the small graves and luckily saw
naught of him. They were filled with sorrow and
regret at having to leave friends and relatives, of
course, but more so at having to leave their little
ones there. Then there was their first born,
Christen, It would be hardest of all to leave him
in Denmark, They were grieved that they had been
unable to bring him into the new Church and that
they might never see him again or know his child-
ren, should he marry. It seemed almost like
cutting off an arm or something, to be forced to
leave part of their very own flesh and blood behind,
It was not that they were worried about him getting
on, In Denmark fourteen was considered the age
when a peasant boy could take care of himself and
only depend on his parents for good counsel and
encouragement, and Christen Jr. would be twenty
in a matter of days, He would be well taken care
of where money was concerned, for awhile at least,
his father had seen to that, In this their son was
most fortunate, for some fathers gave their sons
only their names, though others may have included
a lot of advice in the bargain, But Christen had
been well taken care of all his days and had been
given all the love and consideration that caring
parents could bestow on achild, The young man
had come home for their leaving and to pick up
some things he wanted from there, He would not
consent to going with them to Aalborg for a last
parting, although his mother clung on him and wept
when she begged it. In fact, he planned to leave
Kobberod the day before they did. Bitterness
against the gospel had hardened him, even towards
his own people,

In order to leave the family free for their
visiting, Else had taken over a good part of the
responsibility at the farmhouse -- besides, she
had much to do for herself yet. Thanks to this
generous family she would be properly outfitted
for her marriage and the long journey afterwards.
Her soon-to-be father-in-law had insisted on fur-
nishing her with the money she needed and more;
the gentle Karen had given her linens and bedding,
including some lovely down pillows; Maren had
helped sew her things and added some of her own,
and the little girls had presented her with small
<span id="page-??"></span>
163 Kobberod

gifts and tokens, In fact, the entire family, except
the son Christen, had so showered her with proofs
of their affection that she would lack none of the
material things to take, Laurs was often hovering
about, indulging her whims and tending to her needs,
as atrue lover -- it was wonderful to be a real part
of it all. But there was something none of them
could do for her; she had to make her own goodbys.

Else was still hoping for a brief visit to her
home in Norhaa to have a look at them all there
once again and to bid farewell; also she wished to
introduce them to her betrothed. Laurs had pro-
mised he would take her there, on the way to
Aalborg, should she wish it. They could leave
Kobberod a day ahead of the rest and join them the
following day along the road somewhere. Christen
and Karen in fact had urged it, saying that by all
means Else should go to see her own family before
leaving for America. Eight thousand miles or
more was a long ways away! But no word had
come from anyone in Norhaa in answer to her
letter telling them all about her future plans, and
time was short, Three days before their scheduled
departure there was yet no word from her people
and the disappointed young lady could still make
no definite plans in regards to her home-going.
But the very next day some mail arrived. There
was a package from her sister Karen - some dainty
underthings the sweet girl had made for her, There
was only this brief word enclosed however, -- 'For
your marriage festival with love - from Karen',
‘There was quite a fat letter from Mads though,
and Else's fingers trembled as she tried to unfold
it, she was so eager. Mads had written that the
word of her forthcoming emigration had been a
shock to their whole family, especially coming so
close on the heels of Christen's passing, The
announcement of her planned marriage had upset.
them also, especially since it was to be to a
"Mormon", Their mother, Mette, was prone on
her bed again, weeping. 'Twas enough to have |
Else join the Mormons, she had said, without
having her marry one and then, on top of it all,
sail away with them across the ocean to their
strange kingdom! They at home would never
live this all down as long as they lived, or so said
<span id="page-??"></span>
Kobberod 164

their mother, Even their father seemed somewhat
stunned with it all and kept repeating over and
over, ''No other Mormons shall ever set foot
inside this cottage for they have robbed me of

my daughter!'' This was as Mads put it. Of
course he himself could understand, he said, that
love never asked the religion of its victims before
attacking. But why was she so set on risking her
life, as it were, on the sea, or on the great
prairies where wild animals roamed in herds, or
in the Rocky Mountains where wild Indians, with
tomahawks and arrows, were bent on killing all
intruders there? He closed by saying that her
sisters sent their love, along with his; then added,
"the older ones themselves would be most grateful
for any husbands of their own, no matter what the
variety''. So Mads could still joke, thought Else,
although he should have known how terribly his
letter would disappoint and wound her,

Prayers are not always answered in the way
petitioners desire them to be, but Else's prayers
had found an answer in Mads' letter, for now she
knew she could never go home again and take Laurs
with her. Her goodbys would have to be written.
So she started with her sister Karen, thanking her
for the pretty things she had sent and telling her of
her love and admiration for her, Then she wished
her well and bid her goodby - ''perhaps until we
meet again in another life’, Then she wrote them
each in turn, saying farewell, and to Stine she
added something about Laurs, her betrothed, and
what a kind, good and patient man he was, Though
he was younger than she herself and no taller, being
about her height, yet he was curly-haired, very
manly and so handsome, besides being full of wit
and humor, To the usual love and farewell she
sent to Marie she also added the recipe for the
Christensen family's favorite dish, as well as
other cooking suggestions, Then she invited her
younger sister to come and visit her sometime
when she and Laurs became settled in the Rocky
Mountains, To Mads she wrote many things about
the gospel, bearing her testimony to him and
challenging him to seek after truth, 'Each mind
has to choose between the search for truth and
repose'' she told him; "one can never have both,"
<span id="page-??"></span>
165 Kobberod

She herself had chosen the harder-right over the
easier-wrong and time would bring the reward.
"Come sea, come prairies, come Indians'', she
wrote; 'the Lord will surely protect us!" It was
most difficult writing to her parents, for her tears
kept blotting out the letters and she had to start
over again and again with - 'Dear Far and Mor" -
and then she poured her heart out to them in words
of deepest affection and appreciation, She begged
their forgiveness for any disappointment or unhappi-
ness she had caused them; hoping that sometime
they would understand, She asked the Lord's
choicest blessings upon their heads and promised
to pray for them, in their declining years. Then
she bid them a fond goodby, as her tears streamed
down unwiped, ''Someday', she wrote in closing,
"we shall all meet together again in a brighter
land, where love and trust prevail - were it not
so, and did I not fervently believe it, my heart
would break!'' And then, as she sealed the letter
to them, it suddenly came to her in a flood of
yearning that no matter how long or far away she
should roam, her childhood home would always
call and reach out to her in voices unstilled by
time and space,

5, AALBORG.. . April - May 1866

Bright and early the morning of Wednesday
April 18th 1866, a farm wagon, driven by a good
natured old farmer, drew up at the Christensen
place where Christen's two-seated carriage stood
ready and waiting. The big trunks and large
baggage were soon hoisted into the wagon and
then Maren, Else and Laurs took their places |
there, sitting on various rolls of bedding, They
would pick up Lars Myrup on the way. Karen,
Christen and the three young girls occupied the
carriage, together with lunch sacks, boxes, pack-
ages and bags, Christen, driving his sleek black
team of mares, led out into the country road and
the wagon followed. Of course they were headed
for Aalborg, the point of rendezvous for all Mor-
mon Saints leaving on the next church-sponsored
voyage to America's Zion, which was between 80
<span id="page-??"></span>
Aalborg 166

and 90 American miles from Kobberod, Happiness
was reflected on every face, even the gentle
Karen's; for she was feeling much better than for
several months past, Christen was wearing his
coin lined vest under his coat, but few knew it. He
was taking no chance with the pickpockets, Sena
was still nibbling on her breakfast biscuit, The
young people in the wagon joshed along with the

old farmer who had been hired to drive them to
their destination, Pouline and Trina were all eyes,
and full of questions about everything new they saw
and far too excited to settle down, Soon Karen was
weary of them and begged Christen to stop and let
them get out and go ride in the wagon with Laurs
and Else, while Maren came into the carriage with
them, to look out for Sena, And so the two vehicles
traveled along, one following the other, past
Gettrup and the white church, on through Gundtuft,
which was close to Flarup, and then on to Ydby,
where they turned sharply into the main traveled
highway through Thy. Then they took a north-
easterly direction paralleling the shores of the
lovely Limfjord and its bays, until they passed
near Stagstrup and on to Sundby. It was here that
Else pointed out the road that turned off west
towards her hometown of Norhaa, which was only
about 5 kilometers (64 miles) away. How simple
it would have been to turn off there and make their
way to her parents' home to rest, She turned and
gazed back, as the wagon drove on past the turn,
straining her eyes in looking as long as she'could
see in the direction of Norhaa, Laurs reached out
and patted her arm - but said nothing then,

Some six or so miles later they were in
Thisted City, which was by far the largest place
in Jutland. It was then well into the afternoon and,
although they hoped to reach Myrupgaard, in Lild
Parish, before nightfall, they stopped for a time
to rest mainly because of the weary Karen, While
she rested and Christen and the old farmer watered
and fed the horses, Laurs and Else took the three
little girls for a brief stroll through beautiful
Thisted. Maren had other things than sightseeing
to think of since at Myrupgaard, now only some
fifteen miles away, she would again greet her
sweetheart, Lars Myrup. He had arranged for
<span id="page-??"></span>
167 Aalborg

them to spend the night there with his people, it
being midway between Aalborg and Kobberod,
Afterwards they all sat together on a green bank
overlooking blue Thisted Bay in the. Limfjord and
ate alunch, watching the ships come and go in the
harbor there, There were birds flying in all
. directions; none of them had ever seen so many
flying birds all at once before, Perhaps they
hadn't remembered that they were approaching
the area of Vejlerne, a fjord bay partly filled up
by. sand, one of Europe's major breeding places
for wild birds, It was the mating season for
birds now too! - ae :

The area around Thisted City was more>
hilly, as it was farther north, and they soon
moved into more trees as they left there for
Myrupgaard., It was fun discovering northernmost

Jutland, for one never knew what lay hidden behind
the next bend in the road or.beyond the nearest
crest of hills. There was a striking and charm-
ing contrast between the gentle estuaries of its
east coast and the rougher scenery of its west
coast, where the Christensens had come from.
Towns and villages were spread in pockets, large
and small, some tucked away in valleys, others,
with twisted narrow streets, obstinately climbing.
hillsides, In between the extremes of east and
west coasts were stretches of meadowland and
winding streams, Green routes crossed lush
undulating hills, which could give way unexpectedly
to flat, brown moorland with distant views of then,
again, to a chain of lakes, ~Not far to the east of
the route the Christensens were taking to Myrup-.
gaard was Vikingegrave, a historic graveyard
from the Viking period'of a thousand years before.
Yes, in Denmark's Thy, past, present and future
went hand in hand, This was the area that had
been their home and that they would soon be
leaving, perhaps forever,

They spent the night at Myrupgaard with
Elder Myrup's people, where Lars himself had
greeted them with joy and thanksgiving, The >
following morning early the group took off to-
wards Aalborg, the two happy couples, anticipating
their marriages within a few days, riding in the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Aalborg 168

wagon driven by the old farmer, while Christen,
Karen and the younger girls again occupied the
carriage, Going north a few more miles they

soon swung almost east around Lund Fjord. Lars
Myrup pointed out that directly north a mile or so
from there was Bulbjerg, a white chalk cliff
towering out over the Skagerrak Sea some 165 feet,
and farther out into the water another cliff,
Skarreklit. The company continued to travel on
east through hills, forest areas and many towns
and villages, skirting lakes and streams for a good
part of the day, turning north again they crossed a
great expanse of flatland which had originally been
a great bog. Then they turned directly south
towards the Limfjord, where its waters had
narrowed to not more than the width of a large
river, Here on the north side of the lovely fjord
lay one of the largest Viking burial grounds in
Denmark, Lindholm Hdje, where the grave mounds
as usual were outlined by rocks, in the shape of
ships. Nearby was the large town of Nd¢rresundby,
through which they drove and which was linked to
the city of Aalborg by a bridge going across the
Limfjord, south,

Crossing over the water on this pontoon
bridge, the Christensens and their friends were
soon in Aalborg. It was the first time any of
them, except Christen and Lars Myrup, had been
there and the largest place they had ever seen,

So here it was - the city of which they had heard
so much! Known for its numerous waterways, as
well as its antiquity, Aalborg had been a commer-
cial center for centuries, Large merchants!
houses and warehouses, the house of Jens Bang
(1624) and Aalborg Castle (1539) dominated the
town center, Its industries (akvavit, cement,
tobacco) had more recently carried its name far
and wide. Rightly called a gay and friendly town,
its large parks, with many sculptures, relieved
the pattern of houses, and restaurants, theaters,
and the pleasure gardens (Tivoli-Karolinelund) _
provided healthy entertainment. Other places of
interest there included the St. Budolfl Church
(Botolph); the Monastery of the Holy Ghost (1432);
Aalborg Museum of History and Art; the Aalborg
Hall (the biggest congress hall in Scandinavia), the

The Aalborg Branch of the LDS Church,
established there fifteen years and some months
before, 25 Nov. 1850, was now one of the best and
most active branches of the LDS Church in all of
Scandinavia, Elder Hans Jensen (Hals) of Manti,
Utah, U.S.A., was then president of the Aalborg
branch or Conference and Elder Morten Lund of
Fountain Green, Utah, president of the adjoining
Vendsyssel Conference, These two brethren were
then in Aalborg to assist the incoming members
with their preparations and oversee the job of
emigrating the Saints from their areas. Brother
Lund himself was also preparing to return to his
home in America with the group, There would be
the sick to administer to, marriages to look after,
additional funds to secure for the more needy,
encouragement to give, besides meetings, arrange-
ments, advice, and all the other numerous details
attendant to such an undertaking.

Since the Christen Christensen party from
Kobberod was among the very first to arrive in
Aalborg, the port of departure, that April of 1866,
they were immediately housed in the Saints' meet-
ing hall there. As additional emigrants continued
to arrive from both Conferences the Saints' hall
proved to be far too small to accommodate them
all, so an additional larger hall was hired on
Bispensgade street where most of those from the
Vendayssel area took up quarters, while all made
final preparation for the long journey ahead, Emi-
grants continued to arrive until there were nearly
two hundred of them, Many meetings were held in
which the necessary instructions were imparted by
the brethren who had experience in emigration
matters,

One of the first things the Christensens had
to take care of after getting temporarily settled
in Aalborg was the marriage of their son and
daughter, So three days after their arrival in
that city, it being Sunday 22 April 1866, a double
<span id="page-??"></span>
Aalborg 170

wedding ceremony was held, undoubtedly at the
Saints Meeting Hall, and Maren Christensen be-
came the bride of Elder Lars C, N. Myrup, while
Laurs M, C. Christensen was wed to Else Kath-
rine Andersen, It is most likely that the president
of the Aalborg branch, Elder Hans Jensen, officiated
in the presence of the family, friends and members.
Else felt somewhat alone since none of her own
people were present at the wedding. In fact, none
of her relatives had ever met her intended husband,
although they might easily have, had they been
willing to extend an invitation, Else's past had

to be forced aside now -- 'twas but the prologue

to a new and more exacting life ahead. Recollec-
tions of the bitter and sweet of it however, would
linger with her as long as memory remained.

There were numerous other things requiring
the Christensen's attention during those four weeks
they were in Aalborg. Having their likenesses taken
by a professional photographer was an important
item on their agenda, So, attired in their best,
they went and had a daguerreotype made of their
family group, desiring to record themselves as
they were just before leaving Old Denmark, (Little
did they know then how reproductions of this photo
on tin would be treasured by their posterities more
than a hundred years hence.) So we see them as
they posed for that family portrait in April 1866,
more than a century ago. There is Christen him-
self and his son Laurs in their Sunday suits, each
with curly hair, white shirt, hand-bowed tie, and
waistcoat with an impressive watchchain marching
across it, The gentle Karen is seated there on the
right of Christen, wearing her large fringed shawl
and bonnet tied under her chin, with a dainty white
hand made lace collar at her throat and yards and
yards of long, full skirt billowing out around her
in the latest fashion, doubtless held so by several
stiffly starched underskirts, Maren stands back
of her mother, with amber ear-drops and her hair
in a snood, looking rather solemn for a newly-
wedded bride of seventeen, hardly doing justice
to her real charm and beauty. Pouline and Petrine,
standing on either side of Karen, look very pretty
in their bright plaid dresses with long, ballooned
sleeves, cinched in waists, full long skirts and
<span id="page-??"></span>
171 Aalborg

belts with fancy buckles, each wearing a white lace
collar like their mother's and amber ear-drops and
beads, Little Sena, in her long full-skirted, full-
sleeved costume with tight belt and round buckle,
also wears a lovely white collar, though a sort of
fichu-type one; standing between her father's knees
where he is seated, she looks very preoccupied,
likely with the fellow who is taking the picture.

All the females, both young and old, must have
been well shod in the popular high-buttoned shoes,
even Sena, for these folks were well-to-do Jut-
landic peasants. Later the newlyweds, the four

of them together, had their pictures taken at the
same establishment; Lars Myrup and Laurs
Christensen seated and their wives, Maren and
Else, in shawls and bonnets, standing up proudly
behind them.

. Extra shopping for the daily necessities and
special essentials had to be done but Christen and
the married couples took care of this and as many
of the other daily tasks as they could manage,
leaving the frail Karen free to relax and rest as
best she could under the circumstances, for she
so much needed to conserve her strength for the
more difficult days to come, Almost the complete
care of the children was assumed by them also in
order to lighten that burden for the pregnant
mother, Yes, those were busy people, those
Christensens, and Christen Christensen was a
very busy man, It is likely that the presiding
brethren in Aalborg became well acquainted with
him and his family, It is also most likely that
they counseled with him often and depended on
him for extra money to help out the great cause;
for we have been told that he not only helped pay
off the debts of the Aalborg Branch but that he
also financed the emigration of at least thirty of
the Saints at that time, besides the nine members
of his own party. And among other things, Christen
had to attend to the selling of his fine team and
carriage but likely left that until the very last in
order to have convenient transportation in and
about the city for his family.

It must have been a strange honeymoon for
the two couples, having to share quarters in the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Aalborg 172

Saints meeting hall with nearly a hundred other
people of all ages. That they were joshed and
jollied by many is easy to imagine - but that Laurs
M. C. Christensen always had a ready and witty
answer for each friendly offender is still easier to
believe. Did the four of them ever take the oppor-
tunity to steal away together and explore Aalborg?
Did they borrow father Christen's team and carriage
for rides through the city streets or along the shores
of the beautiful Limfjord? Or did their tastes run
to theatres, pleasure gardens, parks, museums
and the zoo? It is not likely that these honey-
mooners indulged in many of the frivolities in
Aalborg. Elder Myrup must have been kept pretty
busy seeing to the problems of the emigrating con-
verts he had made, besides other branch responsi-
bilities. The other three must have been well
occupied with the many daily tasks pertaining to the
ordinary everyday living in the Christensen family -
meals, washing of dishes and clothes, mending,
minding the children, etc, And there were always
long black stockings to be knit - no woman could
hardly keep ahead of that. Yes, all these things
had to go forward, along with the general prepara-
tions for the voyage, whether or no, These emi-
grant honeymooners from Thy were likely treated
much as ordinary people - but it must have been
fun being married and planning a new home ina
new land anyway! oe

Elder Carl Winderborg was President of the
Scandinavian Mission at that time. Since the trans-
portation of Scandinavian emigrants directly from
Hamburg, Germany to New York had proved so
successful the year before, it was decided that
the same route should be taken by the emigrants
in 1866, bypassing Liverpool and other ports
‘enroute. So President Brigham Young Jr. and
Elder John W,. Young, from the European Mission
headquarters in Liverpool, personally went to
Hamburg in late April to assist President Winder-
burg in making the necessary arrangements to
that end. By the middle of May all was in order
for the departure of the year's first company of
emigrating Saints from Scandinavia,

Wednesday, May 16, 1866, had been set for
the day of their departure from Aalborg, What a
hurry-scurry, hustle and bustle everyone was in!
How many families there were - children swarmed
all over! The ship 'Dania'' was riding at anchor in
the harbor awaiting their boarding, and by midday
most of them were making their way toward the
point of embarkment, marching along in groups,
singing the songs of Zion lustily, in their native
tongue, Friends and relatives of the departing
gathered to say goodby and tearful embraces were
witnessed on all sides, Curious onlookers grouped
themselves along the shore - watching the ''Mor-
mons''; some probably thinking to themselves or
Saying it outright, -- ''Good riddance !"'" Bedding
rolls, bundles, bags and baggage were piled about,
ready to be loaded, and on some of them people
stretched to rest momentarily. Government
inspectors were going over everything and doctors
looked at everyone as their tickets were checked,
It took hours it seemed, Karen, pale and weak
from her ever-increasing burden, yet as gentle,
courageous and full of faith as always, was helped
along by her devoted husband, Christen, while the
newlywedded couples, with the little girls in tow,
came next inline. Someone began blowing ona
mouth organ, as they moved along, the tune to
"Come, Come Ye Saints'', and a number took up
the refrain including some of the Christensens, --
"And should we die before our journey's through,
happy day, allis well, We then are free from toil
and sorrow too, with the just we shall dwell. And
if --'' everyone was hurried along and the song
ceased,

It was a great job getting everyone on board,
especially with so many children, By 4:00 o'clock
in the afternoon, nevertheless, all the emigrants
there were on the ship waiting to leave the city of
Aalborg, Some stood near the railing of the upper
deck, shouting and waving hands and handkerchiefs
shoreward in goodbys. Else too paused there a
moment, and turned to peer anxiously and longingly
among the crowd left on shore for one familiar face
of her youth - but she recognized no one, She
wiped her eyes, and Laurs stole an arm around
her shoulder and smiled sideways at her, as her
<span id="page-??"></span>

father had been wont to do, Then he said softly,
"Ts it then so bad Else?'' When she made no
answer he continued, trying to cheer her, --
"Someday, when we have become rich and important
in Zion, they will welcome you back to Thy with
flags a-flying!"" Dear, kind Laurs, thought Else
sadly; even he could not fully understand, Ja, only
those who had packed their bags and gone away
from their very own forever could know the heart-
break of it. So she said her own goodbys within
herself and then, like ''Ruth of Old') she looked
back no more but turned and followed her husband's
mother.

With the first shudder of the ship excitement
on board exploded and many hastened to wave good-
by again, It was about 5:00 o'clock late afternoon
of 16 May 1866, when the "Dania", with its happy
cargo, was finally lifted upon the breast of the
Limfjord and set sail eastward toward the Cattegate
Sea, headed for Copenhagen,

THEIR PROMISED LAND

"They stood shoulder to shoulder in the
wilderness, far from all help, surrounded by an
overwhelming number of foes, Each day's work;
was fraught with danger as they warred with the
wild forces from which.they wrung their living.
Around them on every side lowered the clouds
of the impending death struggle with the savage
lords of the neighboring lands,"

--Theodore Roosevelt

1, WEARYING MILES WESTWARD

Among the many other Saints who had joined
the Christensens and Myrups for this journey to —
Zion was a young Dane of some fifteen years
named Andrew Jenson, He and his parents and
brother came from the little city of Saeby in the
Vendsyssel Conference. Andrew, fortunately,
kept a day-by-day account of the trip, and to him
we are indebted for a substantial part of the
informerion included in this chapter, Brother
Jenson later became Assistant Historian of the.
LDS Church and traveled widely in Scandinavia .
and elsewhere, collecting historical. information ,

_. for the Church. He wrote several volumes and

it is from two of these, "History of the Scandinavian
Mission" and "Autobiography of Andrew Jenson"
that we have gleaned much about the journey of ©
this company of Saints to Zion. a

The day was fine and the sea calm’ and they
enjoyed sailing over the broad face of the Catte-
gate, but as the vessel heaved, some of the emi-
grants experienced seasickness, At daybreak,
May I7th, they passed the town of Helsinger
(Elsinore) and at 6:00 o'clock a.m. arrived

safely in the city of Copenhagen, the capitol of
Denmark, One of the Elders led the way from the
landing stage to a hall which had been rented for
the purpose, and there most of the emigrants spent
several hours, Some, however, were too deeply
interested in the grandeur of the city to remain
quietly in one place and walked all around, promen-
ading on the ramparts, visiting the principal
squares and churches and enjoying themselves .
immensely. This was the largest city: most of the
emigrants from Jutland had ever seen, Copenhagen
at that time had about 180, 000 inhabitants. (Now,
with its suburbs, it has over a million and is. con-
sidered one of the finest and best governed cities.

in the world.)

Here the emigrants from the Aalborg and
Vendsyssel Conferences were united with emigrat-
ing Saints from other Danish Conferences, and at
1:00 o'clock p.m. they sailed from Copenhagen on
board the steamship ''Aurora'", which was to take
them to Keil in Holstein. The voyage along the
coasts of Zealand and Mé¢én was interesting, the.
most conspicuous landmark being 'Méens Klint"!

a hill of chalk formation which rose abruptly from
the sea 450 feet. The weather was pleasant and
the sea undisturbed. Joy and happiness reigned
supreme on board; most of the Saints seemed
delighted with the prospects before them.

Sailing along on the blue Baltic Sea the
Danish emigrants soon saw the last of their
"Lovely Land" with her green, greenislands, for
day and night grew together and dark covered all,
and when the light of the morning of May 18th came
they had reached ''Kieler Fjord" off the coast of
Holstein, Germany. Sailing up the Fjord they soon
reached the city of Keil where they landed and ©
tarried several hours in the fine waiting room at
the railroad station. Here again the more venture-
some took off to stretch their legs and visit different
parts of this city with its beautiful parks and gardens,
Keil. (now an important seaport of Germany) was
then an attractive city of about 30,000 inhabitants,
It was situated in a fertile district of the country
on a fjord, which was one of the safest harbors
on the Baltic.

At 12:00 o'clock noon they were all seated in
railway cars and left for Altona, about seventy
miles distance, where they arrived after three
hours pleasant journey through the green and
beautiful Holstein. This was the first railroad
ride for the majority of the emigrants, railroad
' building having been commenced in parts of Den-
mark only a few years previous to 1866, From
Altona they all marched down the hill to the banks
of the river Elbe, where the women and children
boarded a little steamer and went by water, while
the men walked a mile or so through a part of
Altona into the city of Hamburg where they were
all lodged in an emigration house to enjoy a com-
fortable nights rest. Again the spark of restless
Viking blood in their veins took a number on
another exploration jaunt and they walked miles
through the great city of Hamburg before retiring.
All spoke German here, which few of the emigrants
understood,

Getting everyone on and off conveyances so
many times took real good managing, and it was
with thanksgiving that they now faced the last of it,
for a time at least, On Saturday, May 19, 1866,
they went on board the double~decked packet ship
"Kenilworth" (a sailing vessel with Capt. Brown
in charge). This ship lay at anchor a short dis-
tance from the dock in the river Elbe. This was
an old English sailing vessel which had been
chartered by the Church on easy terms. It was
ordinarily used for hauling coal, etc, and was
not intended for passenger traffic. But it had
been fitted up on this occasion with bunks and
other conveniences on both decks for the comfort
of the passengers, At the time steamships were-
in common use for ocean travel but the cost to.
the emigrants for such luxury was prohibitive, so
this sailing vessel had been engaged..

The next day, which was Whitsunday (May
20th) was spent in locating the emigrants in
different parts of the ship and showing each family
its bunk, From their anchorage in'the Elbe they
had a fine view of the surroundings, the cities of
Hamburg and Altona on the north and the low and
flat country (Hannover) on the south, On the 21st
<span id="page-??"></span>
Westward 178

a meeting was held on the middle deck of the ship
where the Elders in charge gave instructions in
regards to cleanliness, order and decorum, On
Tuesday, May 22, more emigrants, together with
Elders Carl Winderborg, Niels Wilhelmsen, Geo.
M. Brown and Christian Christiansen, arrived in
Hamburg and were taken on board, This increased
the number of emigrants on the Kenilworth to 684
souls, besides the ship's crew; of these 583 were
from Denmark, 23 from Norway, 73 from Sweden
and 5 from Germany,

The next day (May 23rd) the Kenilworth left
her moorings and was towed by two small tugs a
short distance below Altona (where other supplies
were taken on, including barrels of fresh water).
On the 24th President Carl Winderborg and Elders
Wilhelmsen and Christiansen came on board and
organized the company for traveling, appointing
Samuel L. Sprague as president or leader with
Morten Lund as his assistant. Fred R. E, Berthel-
sen was appointed secretary and Ole H. Berg cap-
tain of the guard, The emigrants were divided into
42 messes or districts containing from twelve to
seventeen persons apiece, with a president over
each whose duty it was to receive provisions and
distribute them to the various families and indivi-
duals in his district; also to preside over prayers
night and morning for his respective group as well
as watch over each of those under his jurisdiction
and see that all rules of cleanliness and order, etc.,
were strictly obeyed. (We can easily imagine that
it was Elder Lars Myrup who would have been placed
in charge of the group which included the Christen-
sens from Kobberod.) On the same occasion the
ship was dedicated by President Carl Winderborg
and the prediction made that it should carry its
precious cargo of souls safe and well to the 'Land
of Promise", Timely and valuable instructions
were imparted by the brethren and the emigrants
were enjoined to yield strict obedience to the
brethren who had been appointed to preside,

On Friday, May 25, 1866, a little after noon,
the ships anchor was lifted and the Kenilworth was
towed down the river Elbe and at 9:00 P,M. sailed
past Cuxhaven at its mouth and was soon far out
<span id="page-??"></span>

on the broad face of the North Sea. The weather
was pleasant, the sea quiet, and the commence-
ment of the voyage promising. Most of the Saints
on board were in high spirits, (Two other com-
panies of Saints from the Scandinavian countries
sailed from Hamburg a few days later, in the ships
"Humbolt'" and ''Cavour'', making the total number
of emigrants from the Scandinavian Mission 1, 213
in 1866. ) :

Saturday, 26 May, the wind was favorable
and the old ship sped on her way swiftly. Some ©
passengers engaged in dancing on the upper deck,
The route was to be north around Scotland for
although this was a longer way than the usual route
through the English Channel which most emigrant
ships leaving continental Europe chose yet it made
it possible to avoid any excessive heat, On Monday
28 May heavy winds arose on the North Sea and
drove them off their course far to the eastward
and so close to the west coast of Norway that its
rocky cliffs could be plainly seen, They encoun-
tered several showers of hail in this area, Due
to the tossing and rocking of the vessel in the
strong winds most of the passengers suffered
more or less from seasickness, In the afternoon
of June Ist, having gotten back on her course, the
ship passed the Shetland and Orkney Islands lying
north of Scotland and before night were on the
somewhat turbulent waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
The winds had turned favorable again, however,
and there was comparatively smooth sailing for
about two weeks, ,

By this time most of the emigrants had gotten
used to life on the ocean waves, They were well
organized and willingly submitted to the discipline
and regulations which had been agreed upon, Thus
at 6:00 o'clock each morning they arose at the
signal of the bugle, attended to absolutions and
then engaged in prayer in the different districts
at 8:00 o'clock, Then they ate breakfast, which
consisted of tea and rye bread in the beginning
but after all the bread had been consumed they
feasted on sea biscuits which were made of rye,
wheat and oatmeal. Their food was prepared and
cooked in a large kitchen from which it was
<span id="page-??"></span>
Westward 180

brought and distributed by the various group presi-
dents in charge, At 11:30 A.M. they had dinner,
which generally consisted of good, solid food. After
that they frequently amused themselves in dancing
or engaged in diverse games on the upper deck in
order to keep up good cheer and counteract the
tediousness of the long voyage. Thus the days for
most passed quickly and pleasantly. At 6:00 P.M.
they had supper and at 9:00 o'clock they were
supposed to retire for the night after having had
prayers at 8:00 o'clock, Cleanliness and order
were strictly observed and all who were able to

do so were required to spend a good part of their
time on the upper deck to enjoy the fresh air and
exercise. Meetings were usually held on Sundays
and other occasions, at which powerful testimonies
were borne and timely instructions given as circum-
stances demanded. A number of marriages were
solemnized on which occasions they generally
indulged in pleasantries, dancing and speech-
making, Even a manuscript paper was issued
almost daily, which introduced humorous and

Spicy articles suitable for the life they led.

Guard was kept up all night and all the
brethren who were of proper age and able took
turns, The captain and the crew were gentlemanly
in their deportment towards the passengers and
treated them in a kind and respectful manner,
allowing them all the privileges that could reason-
ably be expected, and the sick received very good
attention. However, although the food and provi-
sions were Satisfactory enough, the passengers
had difficulty with the cook, a hot-headed and
disagreeable person who quarrelled with several
of the brethren, especially on one occasion when
a fight was barely averted,

Likely much of the conversation those days
on board was about the ''Restored Church" and the
"Land of Zion's for these sincere people must have
felt it a wonderful blessing that the true Church of
Christ, which had been lost because of the wicked-
ness of men, had been brought back to the earth by
the Prophet Joseph Smith in their day. And here
they were, many of them after years of yearning,
planning and scrimping, going to Zion and the
<span id="page-??"></span>
181 Westward

Rocky Mountains which, the good Lord willing,
they would all see before that year's ending.
Could we have listened in and interpréted the
Scandinavian tongue we might have heard some-
thing like this:-- ''Those plates of gold, dug up
from a hillside in America, told of old times
there just like the old stories written on runic
stones in Denmark,"-- ''Ja, ja, Isaw such a
stone once, a peasant ran into it after a rain when
he was plowing a field.'' -- "America seems very
new to:.us but it is as old as the world.'' -- 'Ja, .
the Book of Mormon itself tells the story of the ;
red Indians who lived there long before Columbus
Sailed the seas, and about their religion and their
“ways, just as we have learned about Denmark and
the Vikings in old times,'' -- ''There are still
Indians in Zion now - and on the warpath they say.
'Tis a sure thing we'll see some before we're
through!" -- ''Joseph Smith, the Prophet himself,
shot in a prison, tumbling through a window to die
bravely lying at the base of it in a pool of his own
blood, '' -- 'Nej, the Prophet Joseph is not really
dead, any more than Christ is; though he was
murdered, his spirit seemed to come alive again
in the carpenter and Prophet Brigham Young
whom, if we are lucky, we shall all see in

Zion,'' -- 'Ja, Brigham Young was the one who
led the Saints far from the persecutions of their
enemies across deserts and mountains, the same
way we will go to the Valley of the Great Salt |
Lake where the Saints are building a great city
of their own,'' -- 'Ja, ja, and not only oné valley
but many ~- why all of Denmark could beset
down in the middle of that place they have there
and not be even noticed!'' And so the talk must -
have gone for, once they were caught up in the
spirit and wonder of the Gospel, they could go ©
on and on just like the Restored Church had gone
on even after its Prophet had been murdered,

And surely none of those faithful Saints doubted
but that in America, whose deserts were to
blossom as the rose, they themselves would

find their "Promised Land, "'!

Meanwhile, the Christensen family was in
real trouble, the gentle Karen being very sick,
Frail and ailing at the beginning of the voyage,
and carrying her eleventh child, the heavy lurch-
ing and pitching of the ship, as each new storm
was encountered, upset her more and more until
she was forced to take to her bed and stay there,
It was no ordinary seasickness that she had,
although a calmer sea seemed to soothe her some-
what, Day after day she lay in her bunk unable to
retain any of the little nourishment she could bear
to swallow, until she grew so pale and weak all
who saw her were alarmed. The ship's doctor
was summoned, as fear of cholera and other con-
tagion was always present, but he found nothing of
that sort to be alarmed at, only the rebellion of
the general processes of her weakened body, He
did what he could to ease and comfort her, The
Captain and the crew were as helpful as they could
be, for the Christensens were much respected on
board, Even the quarrelsome cook sent up morsels
to tempt Karen's appetite - but to no avail. It was
felt that if she could just hold out until they reached
port, where she could rest from the sea's motion
and get plenty of fresh air and fresh milk again,
she would have a fair chance of recovery.

It became necessary for someone to be by
Karen most of the time. In order to free Christen
and his older children, as well as Else for this
responsibility, a kindly emigrant sister, Anne
Jensen, was hired to look after the three young
girls a great deal of the time. Anne was a twenty-
eight year old spinster from Vaar, Hjorring Amt,
in the Vendsyssel Conference and had been baptised
into the Church in Feb, 1861. Like Else, she was
emigrating without her own family members and
gladly took over the care of Pouline, now eleven,
Petrine, age seven, and little Sena (Nielsine) who
had her fourth birthday enroute, 15 June, which
must have passed by mostly unnoticed because of
the deep concern of all for her mother's welfare,

It was about this time, the middie of June,
that the weather changed abruptly and became coid
and stormy so that the Kenilworth was forced to
slow down and made poor progress, Then all

became enveloped in a dense fog and Captain
Brown turned to a more southerly course in order
to steer clear of the danger from iceburgs, The’
weather grew worse and continued bad. The heavy
fog was accompanied by continuous headwinds and
the sea became angry and often sent the ship
careening back and forth in a frightening manner,
As the weather worsened,.Karen grew worse
also as well as weaker, Laurs Myrup and the other
Elders administered to the prostrate woman time
and time again; but though they. blessed her, they
made no promise of her. recovery. Christen sat
“by his wife's bedside in misery at her suffering
and Laurs, Maren and others hovered near, but
it was the capable Else who cared for. the cour-
ageous and patient woman's needs, and it was
Christen and Else she clung. to in her most fearful
moments, Karen seemed aware at times that she
was slipping away, and begged to live ~ to reach
the Land of Zion"! - to raise her youdgitlaughters -
to’. see her son Christen again, ‘Occasionally she
called for her little girls to be near-her, but when
allowed, they went away frightened and tearful at
the sight of her woeful face. Sometimes, in’ her
delirium, she became as wild as the storm=-tossed
sea and called upon heaven to save them all: from.
a watery grave,

In Andrew Jenson's personal manuscript .
history appeared this brief account of Karen's
death: -- "Saturday 23 June 1866 - A. regular
windstorm prevailed from the west. The wife of |
Christen Christensen died and was buried at sea.
with much solemnity. (Mrs. Christensen had been
in delicate health for some months and the long _
voyage was too strenuous for her.)!' In his pub-_
lished autobiography we find this entry (page 14):
-- 'The death of Sister Christensen called forth
much sympathy, as she and her husband had been
mo st liberal with their means in assisting their
poor co-religionists to emigrate,'' From writings
of a granddaughter of Karen, Elsie C, _Bartholo-.
mew, we find a little about her burial, quote:

"Her burial at sea, the same day as her death,
was performed as was the custom of such in those
days. Her corpse was sewed into a canvas sack
<span id="page-??"></span>
Westward 184

into which were also placed scissors and other
things thought needful for use in the delivery of
her expected child, All was fastened to a large =
plank, with heavy weights at one end, and then
pushed overboard into the troubled sea.'' So the
faithful, loving mother, the gentle Karen, or
"Carrie' as she had been affectionately called by
her now bereaved husband, never reached the
“Land of Zion' with her beloved family; but who
‘ean doubt but that she went to a far better place -
Heaven, the dearest land of all, Her grieving
family must have been comforted somewhat by _
the many marks of affection, sympathy and re spect
shown them by their friends and fellow voyagers,
Not the least of those to mourn was the daughter-
in-law, Else K, The gentle Karen had become so
dear to her that to be thus parted from her was. iy
like losing a second mother, — ~

There were, continuous headwinds. ‘and foggi-
ness for five weeks in all, which made the voyage
both long and dreary, Many storms were encoun-
tered and little progress made during that period.
On June 26th they encountered a terrific thunder
and rain storm, on which occasion all the sails of
the ship were taken down in double quick time and
the good old ship reeled like a drunken man, caus-
ing much alarm among the passengers, It was not
until the 5th of July that the fog lifted and then it
was found that instead of being near the American
shore, as had been expected, they were still far.
out in the’ Atlantic Ocean, A number of other deaths
took place on the voyage, half of them: during. that
time of wind and fog. We quote again from Andrew
Jenson: -- 'The sad part of our voyage centered
around a number of deaths which occurred, The
following is a list of those of our company who.
found a watery grave: On May 24th a child; on |
May 29th Hulda Rosengren, 94 years old and

from the Aalborg Conference; on July 6th Inger
S, Petersen, 6 years old; on July 12th Sarah
Larsen, an infant; on July 13th Dorthea Beck, a
child from the Copenhagen Conference; and on
July 15th a young man who committed suicide by
jumping overboard,

"During the voyage two children were born,
the first on May 26th and the second on May 29th
when Niels Hansen's wife, from the Vendsyssel
Conference, gave birth to a child which was named
Kenilworth Brown in honor of the vessel and its
captain. Records of seven marriages which took
place on board were also made."

On Sunday, July 15th, which was a beautiful
sunny day, a number of coast vessels were seen
in all directions and joy and animation prevailed
among the emigrants. A meeting was held at
8 a.m, at which timely instructions were given
the emigrants as to their conduct upon landing in
New York, About noon some of the officers
._ looking through their spy glasses said that land
was visible to the northwest, but it was not until
6 p.m, that one of the brethren, looking through
his glasses, called out with a loud voice, 'Land,
land", and soon the green and beautiful coast of
Long Island could be seen on the right by every-
body. Perhaps only those who for weeks and
months have been tossed about on the stormy face
of the ocean can appreciate the pleasure of seeing
terra firma again. The emigrants, who for about
two months had been confined to the decks and
berths of Old Kenilworth, appreciated to the ©
fullest extent the change of vision that they enjoyed
on that memorable day. The drooping spirits of
all were revived and the desire to live in hopes of
a happy future was manifested universally among
the emigrants. They thanked God for bringing
them safely to the shores of America. Some wept
with joy. The men shaved, cut their hair, and
cleaned up on general principles, while the women
began to look for their best dresses in which to
attire themselves when the happy privilege of
landing should be enjoyed. To the Latter-day
Saints the first sight of America had more than
usual significance as this was the "land of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Westward 186

promise", the land of Joseph, about which they had
spoken, dreamed and sung for many years | before
beholding it.

About the time they began to see land one of
the passengers, a young and foolish man, willfully
jumped overboard and was drowned. The ‘ship was
hurridly turned around, a boat lowered, and a num-
ber of sailors.manning it endeavored to save him’
but did. not succeed; he sank in the billows to rise
no more until the resurrection. It was stated by
his friends that he had been induced to emigrate
contrary to his wishes and had repeatedly declared
that he would never see America, and so it was,.:
While the rest were eagerly looking for land, he
resolutely committed suicide by jumping over-
board, The ''Kenilworth" passed Sandy Hook after
dark and about midnight cast anchor off Staten
Island at the entrance of the harbor of New York.

The next morning (July 16th) most of the
passengers arose early to look at the country.
"How beautiful", nearly all exclaimed when they.
emerged from their quarters on the lower decks °
and saw the green hills of Staten Island and the tall
steeples and magnificent buildings of the cities of
New York and Brooklyn in the distance, The plea-
sant morning breeze wafted the pleasing odor of
vegetation and flowers out to them, About Il a.m,
a doctor came on board to ascertain if there were
any contagious diseases among the emigrants or
any other disorder or sickness which might prevent
them from landing, but there were none. Conse-
quently, the anchor was lifted and they sailed into
the harbor and anchored a short distance off the
City of New York, almost opposite Castle Gardens,
(Castle Gardens was a high building similar to a
theatre, built by the American government for the
use and protection of emigrants from the city
sharkers, It was a beautiful place, ) As the sun
rose higher the day became very hot and some of
the passengers were taken sick with the heat,
From their point of anchorage they had a fine view
of New York, Brooklyn, Jersey City, and the
string of villages and towns lining the shores of
New York Bay. They remained on board all day
suffering from the heat, Elders Thomas Taylor

and William Folsom (emigration.agents for the ..

Shortly before noon on july” 17th : they: took —
leave of the ''Kenilworth" and boarded a small

Kenilworth; 52° ‘days since they sailed from Ham -
borg and 46 days since they first reached the
‘Atlantic Ocean, Other than the few deaths, no
serious accidents had happened to them during
their long voyage and they realized that the pre-
dictions made by President: Winderborg, to the
effect that they should pass safely over the great
deep, had been fulfilled. At Castle Gardens they
passed through the usual examinations and scrutiny,
including the enrollment of names, ages, nation-
ality, etc.; after which they enjoyed a few hours
rest in the large, airy rooms of the Gardens,

Elder Thomas Taylor, emigration agent for
the Church in 1866, had experienced’ much trouble
in making the necessary arrangements for trans-
porting the emigrants from New York to the point
where they were to meet the church teams at
Wyoming, Nebraska. The railroad companies
whose lines went out from New York had apparently
planned to speculate at the expense ofthe 'Mor-
mons", and had arbitrarily broken the contract
previously made by the Church agent, by adding
to the price agreed upon for taking the emigrants.
westward, The price was unusually high and Elder
Taylor knew that the emigrants were not able to
pay that extra fare. At length, after having made
a special trip to Boston, Mass., he succeeded in
closing a satisfactory contract for their conveyance
with a railroad company whose terminal was New
Haven, Conn, This was an entirely new route and
several hundred miles longer than that taken by
<span id="page-??"></span>
Westward 188

earlier emigrants west, but turned out to be much
cheaper than the regular route had been. Thus at
9 p.m, the company left Castle Gardens and
marched through a part of New York City to a

point on the East River, where they went on board
a large steamship which had been chartered to take
them to the proposed railroad terminal in New
Haven, Conn, The night was spent sailing up East
River and Long Island Sound when, after a com-
paratively short but unpleasant voyage of 80 miles,
they arrived at New Haven at 5a.m, July 18th.
From the landing place they walked a short distance
to the railroad station where they waited about two
hours for their train to arrive. Here it was dis-
covered that in the turmoil of changing routes and
baggage, the Christensen's two large trunks, con-
taining most of their good clothes, best linens,
keepsakes and treasures, had been lost - or stolen,
There was nothing they could do about it.

When the train rolled in about 8 a.m, they
boarded the cars and left New Haven, starting
northward on their first railroad ride in America.
Their route led through the states of Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Vermont, and they enjoyed the
beautiful scenery very much. To those Danes who
had come from a low, flat country, where the
highest elevation was less than 600 feet above sea
level, the green mountains of Vermont and other
elevated points along their route appeared grand
and majestic, They traveled in 2nd class cars with
comfortable seats, all night and part of the next day.
Crossing the St. Lawrence River on the great
Victorian Bridge they arrived in Montreal, Canada,
early in the afternoon of July 19th. Montreal in
1866 had about 50,000 inhabitants. (At present it
is well over a million.) Here they changed cars.
The new train placed at their disposal here con-
sisted of a few second-class passenger cars and a
number of baggage cars - even some cattle cars
were among them, which upon examination were
found to be dirty and abominable. Their leaders
were informed that they would either have to occupy
these cars or wait at least two days for better
accommodations, and so they concluded to submit
to the inevitable, The dirty cars were swept and
cleaned out as much as possible so that they could
<span id="page-??"></span>
189 Westward

be occupied, after a fashion, Seated on their
bedding or trunks and boxes, they rolled out of
Montreal about 7 p,m., traveling westward along
the St, Lawrence River,

It took them two days to travel through
Canada this way as they met with an accident on
the shores of Lake Ontario where, owing to the
poor condition of the railroad bed, some of the
cars jumped the track and several nearly toppled
over, This accident happened during the night,
and in the morning when they beheld their situation
they truly felt thankful for having been saved from
aterrible disaster, Their train was broken into
three sections on the bank of the lake, Had any
of the cars tipped over they would probably have
rolled down the steep embankment into the water,
As it was the track was torn up for several rods,
In the afternoon, the railroad men having repaired
the damage, they continued their journey and at
7 p.m. arrived in Toronto,

The next day in the afternoon of July 22nd
(which happened to be the nineteenth birthday of
the emigrant Laurs M, C. Christensen), they
arrived at the railroad terminus on the St. Clair
River, which separated Canada from the United
States and its State of Michigan. A steam ferry
boat took them over the river to Fort Huron in
Michigan, where they spent the following night in
a large freight building at the railroad station,
The following day (Monday July 23rd) at 1 p.m.,
seated in good comfortable cars which they surely
appreciated after their experiences in the Canadian
baggage cars, they left Fort Huron and traveled
westward through the State of Michigan, arriving
in Chicago, Ill., that evening late and remained
in the cars until morning. .

Tuesday 24 July, at 10 a.m., another train
was placed at their disposal on which they traveled
through the state of Illinois, traveling the remainder
of that day and the next and arriving at Quincy on
the Mississippi River the morning of July 26th.
There a ferry boat took them over the river to
the state of Missouri, where they waited in the
forest on the bank of the river until 3 p.m, The
weather being very warm, a number of them took

advantage of the opportunity to bathe in the river,
which they thoroughly enjoyed; but a young man of
their company who, being a good swimmer, ven-
tured too far out in the swift river and was carried
away by the current and drowned.

At 4 p.m. they continued their journey through
the state of Missouri, the land where the Saints in
the early days of the church suffered so much per-
secution, In several of the larger towns through
which they passed the people acted very hostile
towards them and made several demonstrations
in the shape of insults and threats, The telegraph
had of course, previous to their arrival, brought
the news of a company of ''Mormons'' coming, and
thus the rough element had time to gather at the
different railroad stations to give them their atten-
tion when they arrived, and ''show their respects",
At various stations the "welcoming committees"!
were dressed as Indians in war paint and feathers
who, brandishing hatchets and knives, shouted
oaths at them and gestured meanacingly. Although
the majority of the emigrants could not understand
a fragment of the language of these ruffians, yet
they had little difficulty in interpreting their fierce
gesticulations and grimaces as they, being urged on
by the hilarious approval of the ribald crowds,
outdid themselves in giving all too realistic and
nerve-wracking performances, Some of the worst
men.in the crowds conveyed the idea, by their
appearance and actions, that they would like to
have treated them as they did their Prophet and
co-religionist years before, The engineer of their
train also appeared to be a bitter enemy. In
stopping and starting the train and in quickening
and lessening the speed he treated them to such
jerks and violent shocks as ordinarily are exper-
ienced only on freight trains, Fortunately none
of them were seriously hurt by those unpleasant
and unnecessary experiences, but some of their
more delicate women were threatened with nervous
breakdowns,

were delayed several hours, The supposition was
that the wicked engineer, in his endeavor to make
it as unpleasant as possible for them, had over-
taxed his engine and broken it before he could use
up its passengers, Nevertheless they arrived at
St. Joseph, on the banks of the Missouri River,
early in the afternoon, safe and well; and thus
terminated their railroad travel,*-which-had lasted
ten days and covered a distance of about 1; 700°
miles, The round-about way they took through
Canada cost $5, 00 less for each adult passenger
than any other route, On their arrival at St,
Joseph they were given only oné hour in which

to procure provisions for a two-day trip up the
Missouri River to. Wyoming, Nebraska, They
boarded the steamboat "Denver" and left St.
Joseph at 5p.m. The following night was a
sleepless one for most of them, In the first
place the weather was too sultry for anybody to -
rest, no place could be found for anyone to make
their beds, and in addition, ‘officers and. crew of
the boat seemed to be regular demons who
endeavored to annoy and vex them in every possible
way. The next day, July 28th, the steamboat
pulled slowly up the muddy Missouri River. The
day being extremely hot they were not able to
venture out from the coverings of the boat for
fear of being sunstruck,

On Sunday, - July 29th, ‘they. arrived safe and
well af the landing below Wyoming, Nebraska,

Wyoming they could spread out and inhale the fresh
air and drink the pure spring water as it gushed
from the hillside... (This was the forty-ninth birth-
day of the recently bereft widower Christen  ....
Christensen, lately of Kobberod in Jutland.) Later
some of their company were taken sick with fever,
a few very seriously. Some ofthis sickness came
upon the sufferers through disobeying the counsel
of the brethren in charge, who had advised the

emigrants not to drink too freely of the ice cold
water issuing from the springs but rather use the
river water after it had been filtered, At least
five of their company died the first week there,
three from the Vendsyssel, one from the Aalborg
and an old lady from the Copenhagen conference,

On Monday, July 30th, their baggage arrived
at the Wyoming landing and was partly carried by
hand and partly by teams to the campground on the
top of the hill, where they were permitted to pitch
their tents on any of the unoccupied land lying
adjacent to the village. Those of the emigrants
who had no tents made themselves temporary shelters
of brush and branches cut from trees in the neigh-
boring woods, While enjoying these conveniences
they spent several days busily engaged in washing
clothes and otherwise preparing for their journey
across the plains, On receiving their baggage at
Wyoming they found that many of the boxes had
been opened and robbed of their contents, and thus
some of the emigrants lost all their clothes and
traveling outfits. While there they could draw pro-
visions from the church storehouse which had been
erected on the campground,

Several of the Church trains sent from the
'Valley'' that year after the poor were encamped
near Wyoming when this company of emigrants
arrived, and had waited for them several days.
Between four and five hundred wagons, with three
or four yoke of oxen to each wagon, were sent that
year by the Church to the Missouri River after
emigrants, most of whom came expecting to cross
the plains with church teams. While the emigrants
were encamped near Wyoming, that little village
assumed an air of importance augmented by the
camps of tents and family boweries occupied by
those Scandinavian pilgrims. This was not the
first company of Scandinavian Saints that had
camped there that year, but several companies
of British emigrants had preceeded them and were
already well out on the plains when they arrived,
In fact, the total number of emigrating Saints
from Europe in 1866 was 3, 327, of whom I, 213

companies came by way of Wyoming and most of
them crossed the plains with church teams,

On Wednesday, August Ist, another company
of Scandinavian emigrants, consisting of about 300
souls, arrived in Wyoming. These were the ones
who had sailed on the ship 'Humboldt'' from Ham-
burg, Germany on June 2nd. The following day,
August 2nd, some of the ''Kenilworthe migrants"!
commenced their journey across the plains from
Wyoming in Capt. Joseph S, Rawlin's train. Aug.
Ath another group headed westward with Peter
Nebeker's church train. On Aug. 5th another
group, who were going with Capt. Andrew H,
Scott's train, moved their things to where the
church teams were camped near the church store
and were assigned their wagons. George M.
Brown, who had been in charge of the Saints on
the ''Humboldt'', was appointed spiritual leader
of this large group of British, Norwegian and
Danish emigrants who were to travel in 46 wagons,
young Andrew Jenson and his family being among
them, It was the intention that this company
should roll out of Wyoming on Aug. 7th, but a
terrible rain storm, accompanied by thunder and
lightning such as none of those from Scandinavia
had ever experienced, visited the area. The rain
poured down in torrents nearly all that day and the
following night until the ground was thoroughly
soaked with the downpour, While the storm was
at its worst the whole village seemed to be a
perfect lake. (Such storms occurred frequently
in this locality in July and August each"year.) The
day after this deluge, Aug. 8th.1866, Capt. Scott's
ox train left Wyoming to cross the plains. :

With'the departure of this company the vill
age of Wyoming was almost reduced. to its usual .

Saints across the plains, This ox train was known
as the Sanpete train, as most of the men and teams
in it were from Sanpete Valley in central Utah,

Among the waiting Saints were a number from
Jutland, Denmark, including Christen Christensen
and his family and some. others to whom he had
given financial assistance; Elder Lars Myrup
(Maren's husband); Sister Anne Jensen, who had
helped with the Christensen children since their
mother's illness and death on the ocean; Christian
Peter Lund, his wife and young family from
Sonderhaa; a few returning Elders to whom brother
Christensen had loaned funds, and Elder Morten.
Lund, former president of the Vendsyssel Con-
ference who was returning to his home in Fountain
Green, Sanpete Co,, Utah,

Christen Christensen and his party, having
lost their large trunks of clothing enroute, were
obliged to purchase more of the necessities at
Wyoming. Here, among other things, Christen
bought three cooking-stoves, one for himself and
one each for his two married children, Little by
little his reserve was being exhausted and it must
have now been necessary for him to fall back on
the gold pieces in the lining of his vest, He had
come to depend on the spinster Anne Jensen toa
great extent by now, in the absence of his dear
wife Karen, until she had grown to seem like a
regular member of his family. Anne herself had
become very fond of Christen and the little girls
and they of her, All, however, were very weary
and anxious to be on their way. It was just short
of four months since the Christensens had left
their home in Thy.

The Norwegian ship ''Cavour'!, for whose com-
pany they were waiting there had been long delayed
on account of headwinds, calm and fog, notwith-
standing the vessel had taken the shorter route by
way of the English Channel, It was July 31st before
the ship arrived at New York, The ''Cavour'' emi-
grants were at once conveyed over the same route
as the one previously taken by the 'Kenilworth"
company, The dreaded disease cholera, having
already broken out on shipboard in brother L.
Larsen's family (most of whom died later on the
trip), raged fiercely among the group as they
traveled by railroad towards the west, claiming
its victims one by one, The rough treatment these

emigrants received was in part responsible for the
heavy death rate, Just before their train arrived
in St. Joseph, Missouri, one of the passenger cars
took fire and it was with great exertion that the sick
were removed from it to escape being burned to
death, At St. Joseph a number of the sick and
dying had to be left in the hands of wicked people.
Their friends obtained no further knowledge as to
their fate, and never learned whether they were
buried alive or killed by force, for the people

with whom they were left were so hateful that they
seemingly thirsted for the blood of the Saints, On
the voyage by steamer up the Missouri River, nine
of the remaining emigrants died, four of them
being buried in the river one night and five the
next, This poor reduced ''Cavour'' company finally
arrived at the landing near Wyoming on Aug. Ilith
1866,

When these emigrants were taken into camp
at Wyoming, sick and weary, there was little time
for them to rest, Capt. Abner Lowry's train of
Church teams had already waited long for their
arrival and it was now so late in the season that.
the start across the plains could be postponed no
longer if they hoped to get across the mountains |
that year. Consequently, this cholera-infested
company had to get ready in the greatest haste for
the long and tedious journey. Two days after their
arrival at Wyoming, on Aug, 13th, these emigrants
left there, together with the Christensens and
others who had been waiting for them. Thus one
of the most pitiable treks of any of the Mormon
Pioneer companies began, This was.the tenth
and last Pioneer company to cross the plains that
year. oe

As had been the case with the other Church
trains, the emigrants had been assigned to their
wagons, ten or twelve persons to each wagon, and
moved their effects thereon, There were about
sixty ox-teams in all in charge of Capt, Abner
Lowry. (This was the last year that emigrants
traveled all the way from the Missouri River to
Salt Lake City with ox-teams, as the Union Pacific
Railroad was being built from Omaha westward
and the following year (1867) was opened for

several hundred miles west of that river.) It was
a sight for those who weren't used to it to see the
teamsters driving long strings of three or four
yoke of oxen to each heavily loaded wagon, without
reins or harnesses, using only long whips and the
three words, ''Gee" ''Haw'' and ''Whoa'" (which the
oxen, through serious lessons had learned to
understand),

2, TRAGEDY ON THE PLAINS

The teams pulled out slowly, traveling a few
miles out on the prairie, and encamped the first
night on the brow of a hill, A meeting was held at
which they were more fully organized for traveling
and the necessary officers of tens and fifties
appointed, as well as interpreters for the Scandin-
avians, Next day they traveled westward until
nearly noon and then stopped for several hours
while provisions were distributed to the passengers
for the first time. The rations allowed consisted
of 14 pounds of flour and one pound of bacon each
day for each adult, besides sugar, molasses, dried
fruit and other eatables, all of which they were to
prepare and cook themselves to suit their respective
tastes, Having never done the like before, some of
the emigrants found the baking of bread and cooking
of meals in the open air a difficult task; but after a
few days practice, most of them learned and life on
the plains soon became rather natural, especially
for those who were young and hearty. To the older
members of the company, and those who had large
families of children, the case was usually quite
different however, The task of walking as much as
possible was enjoined upon every young and able-
bodied person, in order to lighten the burden of
the animals, Only the old, weak and sickly were
privileged to ride to any great extent, and there
were plenty of those in this ill-fated company. At
noon and night, when camping, was their busiest
time, First, they pitched their tents, gathered
fuel and fetched water, then they made fires, baked
bread, cooked other food, and finally ate their meals
around the campfires, sitting on the grass or rocks,
Wood was sometimes very scarce along the way and
<span id="page-??"></span>
197 Tragedy

in such cases they resorted to the use of dry
manure, or ''buffalo chips'' as this was called.
Frequently they had to tramp long distances to

get water and sometimes they had to make ''dry
camp'' where there was no water, Often they had
to cook their meals while the rain poured down in
torrents and drenched them to the skin and put out
their fires, At other times the wind blew so hard,
lifting up the loose soil and enveloping all ina
cloud of dust, that their tents fell and their food
was spiced with sand, For these Scandinavians
from the land of short distances, this was indeed
a new life and at times their energies and patience
were taxed to the utmost, They had to learn that
there were unavoidable difficulties in crossing the
plains; besides, many of them had much more
serious things to grieve them for there were many
sick and dying among them,

In making their camp the usual "Mormon!"
method of forming two half-circles with the wagons
was observed, so that a corral was made into
which the oxen would be driven to be caught and
yoked up anew each morning. Their tents were
pitched outside the enclosure, each tent opposite
the wagon to which it belonged. The oxen and such
loose stock as they had were herded during the
night by special herdsmen who had been brought
along for that purpose, but the regular night watch
in the camp was taken in turn by the emigrating
brethren, Public prayer was offered in camp every
night, in which everybody was supposed to partici-
pate, After the prayer, the Captain or some other
leader generally made remarks of an encouraging
and instructive nature, the essence of which was
translated into Danish for the benefit of those who
didn't yet understand English,

Thus the Abner Lowry Pioneer Company >
traveled from Wyoming, across the prairies of
Nebraska, in a northwesterly direction to the
Platte River, following the so-called Oregon Trail
by way of Fort Kearney to a point near Fort
McPherson, From thence they crossed the high-
land from the South Platte to the North Platte,
reaching the latter stream at the mouth of Ash
Hollow. From here they went along the North
<span id="page-??"></span>
Tragedy 198

Platte by way of Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff
until they reached Fort Laramie, Leaving that
Fort they crossed hills and streams until they
came to the mouth of Deer Creek, a tributary of
the Platte, traveling westward from there to the
upper crossing of the Platte, where the Mormon
Pioneers of 1847 had built a ferry near the site of
the present city of Casper, Wyoming, They crossed
the river on a bridge which stood near the old ferry
and continued on in a northwesterly direction past
Independence Rock and Devils Gate, then followed
the Sweetwater River about seventy miles to the
Continental Divide. Near this point they left the
Oregon Trail and took the Mormon Pioneer trail,
until they came to what was known as the ''Three
Crossings of the Sweetwater",

At several points on the journey they had
come in contact with Indians, most of them friendly
contrary to what the emigrants had expected. They
saw only a few buffaloes, for many of. these noble
animals had been wantonly destroyed by white
hunters, thus wasting the food of the Indians, which
had made the red men very angry. But while the
Sioux Indians and other tribes showed hostilities
to travelers generally, they usually distinguished
between ''Mormon!'! caravans and others; and while
they would steal from most travelers they often
left the ''Mormon Pioneer Trains! alone, During
the early part of their trek the Lowry Company had
plenty of food and to spare, but on reaching the
mountain country the appetites of all but the sick
increased, and yet those in charge were forced to
cut down the rations owing to the fact that some of
the provisions that had been cached at different
points along the way to Wyoming to be used by the
company on their return, had been stolen by
Indians or renegade whites, Thus many of the
more hearty of them suffered for lack of sufficient
food and sometimes longed for good square meals
again.

They generally broke camp about 8 o'clock
each morning and traveled from 12 to 20 miles a
day, stopping about two hours at noon to cook and
feed themselves and animals, The day's journey
was somewhat monotonous at times and most were

when they could stop and rest their weary feet for
a spell, The young people, however, never
seemed to tire and were usually bent on having
their dancing and lively sports at the. day' s end,
-until the call of the horn summoned all together

their journey's end, it is unlikely that many in

this company were ever very gay at any time,
since the hand of death traveled with them all.

the way.

Shortly after the middle of £ September winter
caught up with them as they reached the higher
elevations, A terrific wind and snowstorm came
down upon them and'covered everything. It was
difficult to find fuel for their fires or feed for
their oxen, some of which became badly frozen,

a few almost to the point of disability. Some
mornings it was only with much difficulty that the
teamsters succeeded in getting the hungry and half
frozen animals hitched up and on their way. Capt.
Lowry and his associates knew that many more
storms like this in the Rockies would prove
treacherous, if not disasterous to the weary
animals as well as the sick and elderly of the
company, if not to all. So the captain sent a tele-
gram to the authorities in Salt Lake City asking
that relief be sent them if possible,

Abner Lowry company was lost in the dust of

there, or an incident is recalled of some who

came in that ill-fated wagon-caravan in 1866:
Dorthy Madsen of Manti tells of her great grand-
mother, Christena Roth Jensen of Holstein,
Germany, who came with her husband and children
on the ship "'Cavour'’". Her husband, Louis Jensen,
a Dane from Copenhagen, died as they followed
with the Lowry company along the Sweetwater
River in Wyoming Territory, 11 Sep. 1866, and
was buried there the next day. Feeling very alone
then and hardly knowing what to do, she knelt down
and prayed to her Heavenly Father for guidance as
to whether to eventually go back to her people in
the Old Country or to settle in Zion, At this mo-
ment, as she looked up into Heaven, she beheld a
bright star in the western sky. This immediately
struck her as being an answer to her prayers and
she knew then that she must settle in the west. So
this brave thirty-five year old mother took her
small fatherless children, from five years to nine
months old, including twins, and settled in Sanpete
Valley at Manti. Utah's last original pioneer, Hilde
Anderson Erickson, who passed away January 1968
at one hundred and eight years of age, came with
the Abner Lowry Company across the plains and
settled first in Sanpete. Perhaps one of the most
pathetic stories of members of the Abner Lowry
Company that has yet come to light is the one told
by a Swedish Saint who came on the ship ''Cavour".
This is how sixteen year old Charles Peter Warnick
told it:-- "I, together with my parents, Anders
Peter and Anna Helena Anderson Warnick, my two
brothers, John August and Anders Gustave, my
sister Anne Christine, two sisters-in-law and
three children, left our native land in the latter |
part of April 1866. We were thankful that we had
thus been blessed of the Lord that we were able to
go to Zion where we might live and worship with
those of our faith, without fear of mobs or ridicule,
But alas! How short sighted are we human beings!
We boarded the sailing vessel ''Cavour" at Hamburg,
June Ist 1866, for our trip across the great Atlantic.
The supply of water was very limited for such a
long journey, which lasted nine weeks. We were
allowed one quart of water per family per day. The
water itself was terribly bad, Other rations were
<span id="page-??"></span>
201 Tragedy

likewise limited and of poor quality. Sickness
broke out among the passengers, Iwas so sick
my mother worried as to whether I would be
allowed to land, But that part went all right and
we were glad once more to set foot on Mother
Earth and to enjoy the luxury of good cold water,
as the weather was warm,

"When we landed at New York we went
directly to Castle Garden and from there to
Montreal, Canada. When we saw the string of
cars into which we were being herded, our hearts
almost failed us. But what could we do about it?
We were on the road and must follow it through
even though we were treated like cattle, for that
was the kind of cars the train was made up of,

But those awful hard and dirty cars proved to be

a blessing in disguise, for we had not been long

on the train when cholera broke out in a very
serious form among the people. The poor stricken
souls couldn't have sat up, so with room to spread
their bedding down it was better for them, But oh
how they suffered with the jarring and bumping of
the cars, When we had traveled three days my
dear mother passed away, on the fifth of August,
she being one of the first to go. Her body was

left on the station platform at Marcella, Conditions
continued to get worse and when we reached St,
Joseph a few days later, my father and sister
Christine were left dying on the platform. When

I look back and think of that awful scene I wonder
how we could do it, and I can only think that we
saw so much suffering and death that our sense

of feeling and sympathy must have been paralyzed.
We thought that we were ali doomed and nothing
mattered - the sooner the better. :

"We met ox teams at Wyoming, Nebraska
and started for Salt Lake City on August 13th. The
company we traveled with was made up of teams .
and men from Sanpete County. Our Captain's name
was Abner Lowry and he was from Manti. But the
angel of death had not finished his work; many of
our companions were left in shallow graves by
the roadside, One noon, as we were camping, all
the men that were able were busy digging one large
grave in which seven bodies were buried. We had
<span id="page-??"></span>
Tragedy 202

not been out many days when my brother Anders
Gustave said to me, 'Let us pray for we don't know
how soon our turn will come.' How true he spoke,
for it was only two days later when he passed away
and it was only a few days after that when his
betrothed, Charlotte Bengsten, died; also one of
my brother August's children and a little girl of
my dead sister Christine. Before we reached our
journey's end another of August's children died,
making eight of our number who passed away on
this terrible journey. I remember especially one
whole family that died and in many instances there
were just one or two left of large families, This
was the darkest chapter in my life, but yet in this
great suffering and bereavement we knew they died
in the faith and in hopes of reaching a better land,
Our family was now just John, August and his wife,
Mary Bengsten Warnick, their little girl Caroline,
and myself, Their baby, born on the plains, was
numbered among the dead, Iwas then sixteen
years old,"

Of course it was not unusual for pioneers to
die on their way to the Valleys of the Mountains -
but whole families, how sad that was! In the three
companies of mostly Scandinavians that preceded
Capt. Abner Lowry's, numbers failed to reach
their destinations; ten persons having died in Capt,
Rawling's company, close to thirty in Capt. Nebeker's
and about the same in Capt, Scott's, But the toll
was much greater in this last of the Church trains
of 1866, The death rate, mostly from cholera, was
extremely high, the rough estimate is at least fifty,
but no one really knows just how many among this
ill-fated company battled for their lives with that
terrible malady - and lost,

Autumn's heat upon dry desert plains - parched

prickly thistles - torn, burning, blistered feet;

According to historian Jenson, this relief train
was the last of the Church trains sent out to bring
the poor to Zion that year of 1866. In all, these
were made up of some 10 captains, 456 teamsters,
49 mounted guards, 89 horses, 195 mules, 3,092
oxen and 459 wagons, the largest part of which
traveled all the way to Wyoming, Nebraska and
back. A church that cared this much for the lives
of these poor emigrants would not be inclined to
abandon them when they joined the body of the
Saints in their ''Promised Land",

Much heartened and their loads lightened, the
remaining emigrants continued their travels along
the Mormon Trail. Since they encountered more
severe snowstorms during some of the rest of the
journey, the mortality among them would likely
have been much higher had they not received this
aid from Captain Hinkley's relief train. At South
Pass this telegram was sent to the authorities in
Salt Lake City: ''South Pass, Oct. 3, We camped
here last night - all well - Ab Lowry". From there
the company crossed Little Sandy, Big Sandy, Green
River, Hams Fork, and Black Fork to Fort Bridger,
where the captain sent another telegram to the

brethren; -- 'Bridger, Wyo. Oct, 11 We camp
tonight on the Muddy - Ab Lowry". A well beaten
road led them from the Muddy River by way of
Bear River, Yellow Creek, etc., to the mouth of
Echo Canyon, thence up along the Weber River ten
miles via the present sites of Coalville, ,Hoyts-.
ville and Wanship, buffeting storms and cold most
of the way. Next their route led them through
Silver Creek Canyon, Parleys Park, and then over
the mountain and through Parleys Canyon, at the
mouth of which they entered Great Salt Lake Valley.
Here the mountains no longer came together to
close the view and by climbing up to a bluff, a
short distance above where the old Utah peniten-
tiary later stood, they could see Salt Lake City

in the distance, northwest, 'How beautiful - how
grand!'' was shouted back by those who ascended
to behold with rapture the ''City of the Saints!" --
the place they had all dreamed of, and prayed and
hoped so long to see, Ja, Ja; here it was at last -
their Zion - their Promised Land!

With mounting excitement the company con-
tinued down the mountain pass and on over the
area now called Sugar House; then crossing the
State road, they entered the Church farm where
they camped for the night. The next morning,
which was Mon, Oct, 22, 1866, all were eager
to fix themselves up before taking to the road
again, so it was approaching noon before they
had driven the additional four miles northward |
and entered the Church Tithing Office yard in the
heart of Great Salt Lake City. Here they were
expected, for word had gone ahead, and there
was quite a crowd of welcomers to greet them,

Tragedy 206

There must have been a number to welcome
the Christensens from Jutland - newly made friends
of the ''Kenilworth" - old friends who had come
before, Can we imagine the thrill of it, as long
lost friends embraced and passed on the news and
greetings from the Old Country in their harsh
Jutlandic Danish brogue? A great spirit of
brotherhood had grown up among these Latter-day
Saints; bonds of friendship had been forged which
were to last to the end of living - and who was there
to say they would not last for aye? Time moves
so quickly. It had been more than six months
since these friendly folks had left their home in
Kobberod, near the beautiful Limfjord; yet here
they were in Zion with snow-capped mountains
surrounded - all but the gentle Karen. Soon the
bitter heartbreak of the past would vanish like a
dream and they would begin to build new homes and
sink their roots in the valleys of the mountains,

Those of us living today who might have
driven up Emigration Canyon to the summit of the
present highway, then turned right and followed a
side road briefly to the top of Little Mountain, just
as a giant moon came looming over the Wasatch
peaks to the east, and turned to look down on
Parleys Canyon road, would have seen a queue of
lights from swiftly moving autos, twinkling like a
tiny chain of crystal stars, And then, if we had
turned around and gazed over the canyon's mountain
tops towards Salt Lake Valley, we would have seen
the night-glow of the great city which the Saints
planted there. None of us can imagine the work
and energy that went into the building of Salt Lake
City and its suburbs - or any other city, town or
village in Utah for that matter - without a sense
of awe and wonder, From the very first settlers
wearily trooping onto the hot, dry desert floor,
and the thousands following and building, the cost
in effort and sacrifice is immeasurable, There
was no easy road for our pioneer progenitors, No
one with values can think on these things from high
on top a mountain, where air and reason are clear
and cool, without sensing that people with outstand-
ing faith and great courage toiled to leave us this
marvelous legacy. These noble predecessors of
ours built a mighty empire because they themselves

were mighty - in brain and brawn - in courage,
valour and honesty! They cared little for what
lesser souls thought and said of them. We enjoy
the fruits of their building today and we ought to
be glad and thankful for it. President Heber J.
Grant once said, -- "Dream, young man - dream
nobly and manfully - and your dreams will be your
prophets'', We have been given a heritage bought
by noble dreams,

3, WAR WHOOPS AND DRUMS

After having made the decision to move to a
land uninhabited except by the American Indians,
the Mormon leaders admonished their people to
deal justly with them following a policy of friend-
ship and the "open hand", Though this proved
somewhat successful in the colonization of the
area the sensitivity and emotional makeup of the
Indian was such that a slight or often imagined
grievance was enough to start awar. Such seems
to have been the case in the ''Walker War''! that
had bled the new territory in 1853-54, although
frequent small irritations, and some not so small,
had been leading up to this explosion for some
years, As early as 1850 proud, haughty Chief
Walker (Walkara) had planned to massacre the:
people of Fort Utah (Provo) because Brigham
Young refused to send some of his settlers to aid
Walker in a battle against the Shoshones. For-
tunately, Chief Sowiette, the pioneers' friend,
interceded and calmed the fiery tempered Chief,

The Mormon leaders were soon made aware
that something more than food and friendship would
have to be used to cope with the Indians, Their
policy had been a noble one, but the frequent
infringements by the red brethren - their child-
like inability to refrain from petty thievery, as
well as other irresponsible behavior - placed a
great burden on the struggling settlers. As one
incident after another occurred, President Brig-
ham Young realized the need for some form of
military organization and thus determined to
reorganize the Nauvoo Legion, which had been
an integral part of the Church in Illinois. This
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 208

was done at a meeting held in Salt Lake City April
iz, 1852, where appointment of officers was made
and Daniel H, Wells chosen as Lieutenant General,
The defense of the people of Utah and the protection
of their property became the major concern of this
organization, Much vigilance and tact was called
for by the Legion members.

In spite of the subduing of Walker and his
warriors, who had vowed their war would last
until all the whites were exterminated, and in spite
of the peace treaty they had signed with Brigham
Young in May 1854, the stealing and killings went
on, causing much destruction of livestock and some
loss of human life. Indian attacks on travelers and
settlements usually came when least expected; for
example: June 4, 1858 - Jens Jorgensen and wife,
Jens Terkelsen and Christian E. Kjerulf were
massacred in Salt Creek Canyon while traveling
unarmed to Sanpete Valley; Oct, 15 - the remains
of Josiah Call and Samuel Brown of Fillmore were
found near Chicken Creek bridge in Juab County -
the mutilation of their bodies proved it was the
work of redmen; Mar. 22, 1860 - the Overland
mailcoach was attacked by Indians near Eight Mile
Station, Tooele County, with Henry Harper, the
driver, being killed and a passenger wounded;

May 28, inthe same county, Indians attacked the
mail station at Deep Creek, shot a man and stole
several horses; July 22, Smithfield, Cache County
was attacked by Indians and a fight ensued during
which John Reed and Ira Merrill and two Indians
were killed and several on both sides wounded;
Apr. 12, 1863 - a band of about fifty Indians, led
by Chief Little Soldier, attacked a group of soldiers
from Fort Douglas who were camped at Pleasant
Grove, Utah County, who frightened them away
with a small cannon but lost their horses, blankets
and supplies in the fray; June 10 - Wood Reynolds
and another unarmed man were killed when a stage-
coach was attacked by mounted Indians between
Fort Chittenden and the Jordan in Utah County.

The attacking Indians sometimes wore little cloth-
ing - a breech clout and moccasins being their
uniforms, Some painted their faces black on occa-
sions, but they always had guns, pistols or bows
and quivers of arrows, besides their knives or

tomahawks, These were but a few of the many
incidents leading up to the Black Hawk Indian War
which engulfed the settlers in this territory from
1866 to 1869, particularly those of Sanpete, Sevier
and other southern counties, becoming Utah's
bloodiest conflict of the last century.

The Black Hawk War is said to have officially
begun at Manti in Sanpete Valley Apr. 9, 1865.
Research seems to warrant the account presented
by Carlton Culmsee as probably the most logical
record of the event: -- ''Black Hawk sat in sacra-
ment meeting one peaceful Sunday in Manti. He
stared at the speakers as if absorbed in their
words, Perhaps he was. Perhaps, however, the
tall chief was thinking of a tribe of Utes not far
away, who were full of superstitious anger at these
white men, Those Utes were like dead leaves of
rabbit brush, like good timber. Ifa spark fell
among them --- ! But whatever reveries Black
Hawk had, he listened keenly to one part of the
meeting. Plans were announced for rounding up
the livestock in the district of the Indian farm at
Twelve Mile Creek, This was to be the customary
general spring roundup, Meeting ended. Black
Hawk went to the house of James Tooth, where he
customarily ate after the services,

"Meanwhile, an historic event was occurring
at Jerome Kempton's place in the same town.
Some leading Utes had met with prominent settlers
to discuss the recent outbreak of cattle stealing,
John Lowry and Archibald Buchanan acted as
interpreters, Inthe circle of onlookers were
Kempton, David Shand Sr., J, C. Madsen, Jens
Madsen, Arthur Vorhees, Louis Kjar and Peter
Munk, Matters appeared to be approaching an
amicable settlement in the hands of these frontier
diplomats, the interpreters, All that interfered
was an irreconcilable among the Indians - Jake
Arropeen, He was a young sub-chief whose father
had died of the smallpox which had attacked the
band the preceding winter, Jake believed the
whites had enlisted the aid of evil spirits and
murdered his father by supernatural means, so
he refused to be soothed, He rode about shouting
that he would''kill Mormons and eat Mormon beef",
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 210

John Lowry at length became exasperated, He
commanded the chief to be quiet. Suddenly some-
one cried 'Lowry, look out! He's going to shoot!'!
Before the Indian could draw his bow, Lowry
Sprang at him, He seized him by the shirt collar
and jerked him off his horse, He talked to him
sharply and then released him, Some accounts
have it that Lowry was drunk, that he insulted

the chief, infuriating the tribesmen. Thus the
guilt for starting the war is frequently laid upon
Lowry's shoulders, But Peter Munk, one of the
eyewitnesses, swears that version is false. He
declares Lowry, in all sobriety, simply acted
swiftly when warned of danger,"

Most of the settlers of this small community
of Manti were in meeting on this apparently peace-
ful Sunday morning. A few of the men had stayed
in front of the little store, talking, They had .
watched unconcernedly as Jake Arropeen rode into
the fort, They were entirely unprepared for the
swiftness with which the mood changed from one
of peace to blatant danger as John Lowry and
Chief Arropeen clashed in anger, Meanwhile,
Chief Black Hawk, sensing further trouble,
abruptly left the Manti fort and returned to the
Indian camp where he hurried the squaws, children
and old men, together with camp equipment, off to
the mountains, leaving the braves in support of
Arropeen, who subsequently also rode angrily away.

That afternoon the settlers called a meeting
to see how best to handle this unexpected crisis,
Realizing that their cattle which were roaming the
entire valley would be most vulnerable, they asked
for volunteers to start the next morning to round
them up. Thus, on the morning of April 10th, a
small party of unarmed men from Manti started
for the Indian farm at Twelve Mile Creek to gather
the stock, On the way they were attacked by
Indians, who killed young Peter Ludvigsen and put
the others to flight. They returned to the fort with
word about Ludvigsen and soon a party of armed
men on horseback, together with a team and wagon,
set out to recover the body, which they found face
down in a prickly-pear bush, According to Peter
Munk, 'All clothing except the sox had been
<span id="page-??"></span>

removed and the Indians had cut a strip of flesh
from the back, This they had roasted and each
taken a bite - a sure sign of war with the Indians,
The mutilated body was laid carefully: in the wagon
and brought back to Manti for burial... That:same
evening Elijah B. Ward and James Andersén were
killed and scalped by Indians in Salina Canyon, who
also drove away a number of cattle: belonging to
the settlers there,"

So a war was on and Black Hawk and ‘his
minions worked havoc, Raiding,. stealing, tortur-
ing, plundering and killing became the Indians'
pastime, Their war-whoops could be heard,
curdling the air as they swooped down unsuspectedly
on the often helpless settlers, They seemed to
specialize in the art of surprise and ambuscade,
This became a time of terror as the savages came
shooting their arrows and guns, killing and pilfer-
ing that which the Saints had built, It was a time
when farmers could not work in their fields or go
to the canyons for wood without the aid of armed
men,‘ Herds of stock needed guarding day and
night, Even in the settlements themselves no one
was safe, Asa result, entire counties were
abandoned by the frightened settlers and left to.
the redmen, The larger communities that had
no forts were advised to build them, and here the.
homeless ones gathered for protection, None felt
safe, .

It was fortunate for the people of Utah that
with customary foresight President Brigham Young
had ordered the re-activation of the Nauvoo Legion.
The machinery having therefore already been set
up to protect the people, it remained only to alert
every male resident of the territory as to his. duty
in-the common struggle; for although this war’was
initially contained in the two counties of. Sanpete a
and Sevier, it soon spread until nearly every area
of the State was more or less affected, Brigham
Young issued the following instructions in Aug, 1865;

"It is required by the laws of the Territory
of Utah of every male citizen from eighteen to
forty-five to be armed and equipped and ready
for any duty he may be called upon to perform as
‘one of the militia of the county; and if any refuse
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 212

to obey the laws of the land, I would try them
before their bishops for that as readily as I would
if they were to refuse to pay a just debt; and if
they would not repent I would sever them from

the Church and give them over to the laws of the
land, Ido not know that there is one person in the
Territory who would refuse to perform military
duty, there are strangers in our midst, but I very
much doubt if one could be found who would refuse
to do military duty. . .'!'

The history of the Black Hawk War is filled
with incidents of the killing of men, women and
children without warning or a chance to defend
themselves, During the first year alone it was
estimated that the Indians drove off as plunder
2,000 head of cattle and horses and killed between
30 and 40 whites, Manti became the center of
activities against the redmen, although they were
pursued and attacked in many different locations.
General Warren Stone Snow was given full com-
mand of the Sanpete military district in 1865 and
played a conspicuous part inthe war, Nauvoo
Legion cavalry companies from Davis, Salt Lake,
Utah and other northern counties made Manti their
headquarters on many occasions to assist him and
his men in their efforts to save the lives and pro-
perty of their fellow sufferers,

Oct. 17th of that year, Martin Pedersen
Kuhre and wife, Elizabeth Petersen, William
Thorpe, Soren N, Jespersen, Benj. J. Black
and William T. Hite were killed by Indians led by
Chief Black Hawk. This happened near the settle-
ment of Ephraim, Sanpete Co,, six miles north of
Manti. This was the last raid of the year in that
area, as the Indians there, well supplied with
"Mormon beef'' for the winter, withdrew to their
hideouts in the mountains, But the Indian War
continued in the warmer parts of southern Utah
and a number of the smaller settlements there
were abandoned by the settlers, The campaigns
of these cunning natives could not safely be mini-
mized, let alone be regarded with disdain or
contempt. Otherwise inefficient, these redmen
were dangerously proficient in their specialized
skill, the art of war. Their guerrilla tactics kept
<span id="page-??"></span>
213 War Whoops

the frontier settlements in hot water, to say the
least, and the militia on the jump.

The spring of 1866 had scarcely broken when
the redskins swooped down from their winter
retreats to carry on their devilish sport of plunder-
ing and killing again. Horror once more rode bare-
back through the valleys! The sound of big bass
drums boomed out over hamlet and village; men
grabbed their guns and headed for their horses and
women snatched up their little ones and ran to
shelter for their lives, All settlements south and
east of Salt Lake City were placed ina state of
defense and Nauvoo Legion troops were ordered
to the scenes of hostilities. Apr, 2 Joseph and
Robert Berry and the latter's wife were killed by
Indians near a ranch on Short Creek in Kane
county. .. Apr. 20 - The Indians attacked Salina,
Sevier county, drove off about two hundred head
of stock and killed two men who were guarding
them, Soon afterwards the settlers vacated Salina
and removed to Gunnison, Sanpete Co, No one
knew when or where the bloodthirsty redskins
would strike or who would be the next victim,

May Ist - President Brigham Young sent out
a proclamation instructing the people in Sanpete,
Piute and Sevier counties to collect themselves
together in bodies of not less than 150 men, arm
themselves well and protect their people and stock
from the Indians, Guns were scarce and many a
white brother traded a good steer for a poor rifle
during those treacherous times. The able-bodied
men of the communities were gathered together
into fighting groups and often spread out over the
country chasing the foe, sometimes leaving only
the women, children and elderly men in the thinly
settled areas, On such occasions the people
realized their helpless condition, especially when
the beat of the big drums warned them Indians
were coming, and they gathered in fright into the
small public squares with pitchforks and shotguns,
while whooping Indians could be seen driving their
herds away and shooting down their brothers and
sisters before their very eyes. Armed militia
were once again sent from the counties to the
north to help those in Sanpete and Sevier, while
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 214

the few remaining residents of Piute county moved
together into Circleville,

While the hostile redmen craftily avoided the
military on most occasions, yet they continued
their atrocities upon the settlers, as well as the
raids on their livestock, Striking sometimes
north, sometimes south, they drove the white
men's herds off into the mountains, killing anyone
who got in their way. By the late autumn of that
second year of this bloody war it was estimated
that, like the year before, over 2,000 head of
cattle and horses had been stolen, as well as
about fifty Indians and more than twenty whites
killed, It was further estimated that at least
2,500 men were under arms during that year of
1866, What a sacrifice in lives, time and means
for a poor, struggling territory to be forced to
endure!

In Salt Lake City that latter part of October,
the Abner Lowry company of Scandinavian emi-
grants and their escorts loaded up once again, in
preparation for the remainder of their journey,
and headed south towards Sanpete Valley. Capt.
Lowry and his associates were anxious to get to
their homes and families in the various settlements
there, The newly arrived Saints must surely have
been initiated into the threat of the Black Hawk
Indian war through numerous, frightening tales of
raids and killings in the area where they were
going. The guards and teamsters were well armed,
as was usual on such trips, and although the fear
of Indians was not as great or attacks as likely ©
when approaching winter spread its mantle, yet it
was always advisable now to be prepared and on
the lookout for dusky intruders; not knowing when
uninvited guests might come - with arrows and
tomahawks !

As the wagon train moved out of Salt Lake
Valley the Christensens from Thy were aboard,
Most everyone was allowed to ride on this trip,
since the loads had been considerably lightened,
Christen Christensen himself was very much
disturbed about something. During the excitement
and confusion of their arrival and welcome in Salt

Lake City - greetings from friends - passing on
the news and such from Old Denmark and all that -
Hans Jensen's orphans had disappeared! Someone
shad come to Tithing Office Square and taken them
away unbeknown to the Christensens, who had sub-
sequently been unable to find out who it was or
anything at all about their whereabouts, All ques-
tions and searching had failed to turn up one thing
on the matter, So, as they rode along south,
Christen fretted about this, perhaps more than he
did about Indians, He had fully intended to make
arrangements for the future care and keeping of
those children himself,

The ox-drawn wagons stopped at each settle-
ment of any consequence enroute to let off a few
passengers and their baggage, but the majority
were going to Sanpete. They could scarcely make
more than twenty miles in an average day, since
it was necessary for the animals and teamsters to
rest at intervals, particularly at nights. Also, —
night driving could prove extremely dangerous
with Indians on the warpath. Naturally the team-
sters made great effort to reach a settlement for
each evenings camping, since this was far less
risky and a heap more pleasant and comfortable |
with friends from these places around them,’ Some-
times merriment and entertainment were provided
specially, Pleasant Grove was selected for the
first nights rest, and here they bid farewell to
young Andrew Jenson, his brother and parents
who had joined them at Salt Lake, having left ‘the
Scott company there earlier, as well as what was
left of the Warnick family. Capt. Scott's train
had gone directly to Utah County where its wagons
had mostly come from, so the Lowry group were.
able to renew pleasantries with some,of their
former 'Kenilworth" friends in that place, as well
as in other Utah County settlements at which-they
stopped to rest, a eee Soa

As the emigrants from Little Denmark viewed
the patchwork of farms and stretches of sage along
their line of travel, they must have been impressed
with the vast amount of good, fertile land yet to be
tilled in Utah. It was not so inthe Old Country —
where they came from, Stopping at Nephi in Juab
County about their fourth night out, they undoubtedly
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 216

viewed that village with interest, since they had
heard of some of the Indian troubles that had taken
place in early spring of that very year, when many
Indians had been taken prisoners and jailed there,
including several Indian Chiefs, who were later
taken by General Snow and his men to Manti, where
they eventually broke jail. The travelers could
have heard here of a recent outrageous attack

(Oct. 23) on a family near Beaver, Utah, when
Indians surrounded their ranch house at daybreak,
set fire to the roof and tried with guns and pitch-
forks to exterminate the occupants - and would have,
save for the heroic flight for help of a young boy.
Such stories sent chills down most spines; and if
any of the Lowry company had put Indians out of
their minds at that point they must have been jerked
up to a state of renewed vigilance at hearing of
those details, .

Just east of Nephi lay Salt Creek Canyon
through which they had to pass, It had proved to
be a dangerous route for whites during any Indian
trouble. A number had been ambushed there that
very year. The road was narrow, rough, muddy
and snow patched then, winding through hills often
pressing close on both sides obstructing the view,
It was easy here for savages to swoop down on
unsuspecting travelers and be off again up a well
hidden canyon as fast as they came, As the Lowry
ox train picked its way through, we can be sure ©
that most of its passengers were on the lookout and
filled with apprehension, if not outright fear,

The end of this canyon marked the boundary
line between Juab and Sanpete counties, and beyond
that south six miles was Fountain Green, a small
settlement with a newly built rock fort, Located
on Uinta Creek, it was first called Uinta Springs
but later changed to Fountain Green because of the
water running from a spring in the mountains and
spreading over the beautiful green grass meadow
where the small village lay. This had become a
favorite camping place for settlers going to and
from Salt Lake to south Sanpete, Early that past
spring the people of Fountain Green had been
ordered to move to the Moroni Fort about seven
miles south, as a protection against Chief Black

Hawk's warriors, as their settlement had been
subject to several Indian raids, While living in
Moroni that summer of 1866, the Fountain Green
settlers had built a fort of their own and had just
moved back to the settlement to occupy it.

It had been decided beforehand that Christen
Christensen and his younger daughters, Pauline,
Petrine and Nielsene, as well as Anne Jensen,
would stop off at Fountain Green and spend the
winter with friends there and in Moroni, The
family things therefore had been sorted and
repacked in preparation for it, since Laurs and
Else, Maren and Lars Myrup were continuing
south to Manti, It had also been pretty well
decided that Christen and Anne would be wed soon
after they reached their destination, He desper-
ately needed a mother for his children and Anne
seemed just the one for the job. She had proved
to be well qualified for it and the little girls loved
her; besides she and Christen had become very
fond of each other, Elder Morten Lund, who had
come all the way from Aalborg in their company,
also dropped off at Fountain Green for this was
his home and here his wife and children awaited
him, It is quite possible that it was Elder Lund
who, nearly three weeks later (Nov. 17, 1866),
performed the marriage ceremony that made
Christen and Anne husband and wife.

The rock fort there had been constructed
much like other forts in the territory. Its inner
walls backed each dwelling and all doors opened
into it, On each corner was a bastion where
guards were on the lookout at all times. One
large gate provided the only outside entrance to
the fort, and all public gatherings were held in
its center, Drums were beaten to warn its inhabi-
tants of any approaching enemy. Into this fort
Christen, Anne and the girls moved, as well as
any other incoming emigrants of the Lowry com-
pany who had chosen to stay at Fountain Green.
Likely Christen had long since disposed of the
last of his vest lining gold pieces, for it has been
said that he spent his last change here to buy milk
for his young daughters. No matter, the settlers
there must have just moved-over-a-bit and taken

It was some twenty-eight miles south from
Fountain Green to the town of Manti, largest and
oldest permanent settlement in Sanpete Valley. It
was the first of November before the remainder of
the company reached there, Many had been dropped
along the way. Here the teams and passengers dis-
banded - it was the end of the line, It had now been
six-and-a-half months since the Christensens left
their home in Thy, but in the interim they had
crossed a mighty ocean and a vast continent - from
lowland seas to highest mountains - left all they had
to start other homes, It is hard for us of this jet
generation to comprehend the magnitude of it from
their point of view. Far more difficult than the
physical hardships, the partings, the tedium of
sailing ship and plodding ox team travel and all
that, was the putting behind them of old thinking,
language, habits, beliefs and old securities - to
face the unknown. As Laurs and Else Christensen
and Maren and Lars Myrup alighted in Manti, with
little ought but their meager baggage and each other,
they might have said to themselves in their mixed
up broken English, -- 'Ja, ''Ve'' are here but ''vot'!
now ?'!

Manti then was a seventeen year old settle-
ment, having been first occupied by Mormon pioneers
in November 1849. Many were the tales told of those
first struggling years - of rattlesnakes, grass-
hoppers, drought, hunger, Indians, massacres,
death - but then again of courage, steadfastness,
brotherhood, building, romance, miracles and
thanksgiving, The inhabitants had built a fort
around them during the Walker War (1854) as a
greater protection against destructive redmen,
Called the Big Fort, it consisted of a continuous
rock wall twelve feet high, three feet wide at the
bottom and two feet wide at the top, surrounding an

part, supplying plenty of water. Thus fortified,
the town itself had grown up mostly within this
wall, with dwellings of adobe, log, rock or even
dugout, as well as a few stores and businesses
situated here and there at intervals along its
streets, A square block in the central part of the
area was set aside as a public square and known
as the ''Tabernacle Block", On this block were
housed the two main points of community interest,
the ''Bowery'! and the ''Council House",

Every early Mormon settlement had its
"Bowery" and Manti was no exception. A huge
shed supported by logs and roofed with thick
layers of boughs and willows was erected where
the Manti High School was later located, This
open-air affair sheltered Conference goers and
- worshipers in summers and clement weather, It
accommodated the whole of the townspeople on
Fourth and Twenty-fourth of July celebrations
and such. Even after new quarters were built
for worship and celebrations, it became a play-
ground for school children in bad weather until it
collapsed one rainy day, suddenly and without
warning, catching a group of boys under its
sodden mass, Luckily none were killed, though
some were dazed or injured - but the whole town
was wild with excitement while it lasted,

The "Council House'"", a large two-story rock
building, had been erected in 1855-56 just east of
the Bowery on the site where the Manti Library
now stands, It served the people of the town well
for fifty years, Everyone went to church there, _
but it was the place of many other activities as.
well, since educational, social, civic and recrea-
tional functions of all kinds were held.there too,

It is surprising the variety and extent of such
things the people of Manti found time for in those
early days, with so much hard work to be done.
Concerts, dramas, musicals, rallies, dances’.
and celebrations of all kinds were held in’the’ -
Council House, for it seemed that the buoyant
spirit encouraged by the pioneer leaders, as a
balance against trials and hardships, waxed strong
in the bosoms of those early ''Sanpeters",

The upper story of the Council House was
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 220

approached by a narrow wood stairway climbing

an outside wall of the building, In the late '60s it
became necessary to strengthen the upper floor by
adding supports underneath. A stage and dressing
rooms were added to that second story at the same
time (1867) so that the home dramatic companies
who held forth there on various occasions could put
on better productions, Dances were also held on
the top floor and this was by far the most popular
of all forms of entertainment with most of these
early settlers. Dancing parties on this rough,
knotty-pine floor to the music of ''Fiddler Hansen",
as he taught new jigs and steps, were the constant
delight of anyone in Manti old enough or bold enough
to 'trip the light fantastic", Whatever one called
for - quadrilie, Mazurka, Schottische, Waltz-
quadrill, Heal-and-Toe Polka, French Four, etc, -
he had it!

It must in no way be assumed that entertain-
ment and jollity took precedence over worship in
early Manti, for indeed such was not the case.
Here nearly everyone went to church, for that is
what had brought them all west across wilderness
and oceans in the first place -- to be able to worship
how, when and where they chose, and in peace and
safety. It so happened that the first settlers of
Manti were mostly Yankees, in whose veins flowed
the blood of Pilgrims and Puritans, Theirs was a
heritage of worship, Scandinavian emigrants,
much humbled by persecution, sacrifice and priva-
tion, had later come in numbers and been added to
the fold. They were even more reverent in spirit,
if this were possible, having been well taught by
humble missionaries and having felt the hand of
the Almighty all the way in their travels to the
"Promised Land",

That very year of 1866, as an added protection
during the Black Hawk War, another rock wall had
been built within the Big Fort, enclosing the Taber-
nacle Block. A fence was built through the center
of this "Little Fort'', dividing the enclosure so that
one part could be used in case of Indian attack for
corralling the town's stock, If the big bass drums
sounded a warning, in from the surrounding farms
and fields the cattle and horses would be driven on
<span id="page-??"></span>

the run, while into the other side of the divided
area the women and children would flock for safety,

The only means of communication with the
outside world in the Utah Territory, outside of the
Great Salt Lake area, was by walking, or trips
made on horseback, or by horse, mule or ox-
drawn conveyances, This must have been a lonely
and even frightening situation to contemplate, espec-
ially in times of trouble, (In our age, when one can
witness and hear events all over the world with a
flick of a button, we can in no way imagine what
this would be like,) There must have been rejoicing
in the various areas involved then, when on Sat,
Dec, Ist, 1866, the Deseret telegraph line was
opened between Salt Lake City and Ogden; on Dec.
8th opened between there and Logan; and on Dec.
28th opened between Salt Lake City and Manti. (It
is difficult to evaluate the importance played by
the Deseret telegraph operators in Sanpete Valley
during the remaining years of the Black Hawk War,
as they took turns nights, sleeping on the floor of
the office in case word should come from neigh-
boring towns that the Indians were on the warpath.
If an attack were coming the people would then be
warned of the approaching danger by the rapid
beating of drums, )

Having been taken into the homes of Danish
friends for the time being, the two young emigrant
couples must have made themselves as comfortable
and useful as they could, The two brethren, Laurs
M. C. and Lars C, N, must, of course, have been
taken into the militia right away and given their
assigned work there as guards, minute men, armed
cattle herders, or whatever, Since it was now con-
sidered too late in the season for any large scale
Indian operation, they probably went into the moun-
tains with others to get out logs and rock for con-
templated dwellings of their own or the community,
as well as wood for ever-hungry fires, That they
toiled though we may be certain, for most every-
thing there then was on a cooperative basis and
all shared and shared alike,

Else and Maren as well must have had their
share of work, learning the new ''American' ways
of keeping house and concocting victuals ''a-la-mode's
<span id="page-??"></span>

knitting, weaving, spinning, seaming, mixing,
baking, churning - candle making, soap making,
soup making - there was never any end to it,
Undoubtedly they were able to teach the Yankee
settlers some things too; there must have been
quite a transplantation of Scandinavian culture to
Sanpete Valley. Trying to learn the new language
was a chore in itself; yet with so many Danes
around, it could scarcely have been considered
a pressing necessity to learn English, But Else
at least was determined in this and somehow she
seemed more apt at it than the others,

Being so friendly, healthy and young, they
must have found time for dancing in the Council
House and other entertainment and cultural events
also, If there were any sports in order, like
wrestling, horseshoes, handsprings and the like,
one was bound to find the two young Danish brethren,
Christensen and Myrup, there, Quilting and rug
bees doubtless attracted the girls; and if spelling
bees were ever held in the Danish language, one
would surely have found Else K, present, for she
took eagerly to things of that nature. She knew her
Danish! (But as long as she lived she never quite
got her English V's and W's straightened out, )

January 23, 1867 the Deseret News carried
a speech by President Brigham Young, from which
we quote excerpts: -- ''All our past experience with
the subtle Indians teaches us the force of the prin-
ciple 'Eternal vigilance is the price of safety',
There is no season of the year when those who are
exposed to the aggressions of the savages should
relax their guard. . . We know that brethren in
those regions have had much difficulty and hope
they will keep their stock well guarded and lives
and property preserved, Solitary individuals being
or moving about, where Indians are liable to pounce
upon them and kill them, manifest a degree of care-
lessness which is highly culpable. . . We earnestly
hope that the brethren south will adopt every means
in their power to guard against such dangers,"'

Early in 1867 it became plain to the settlers
in Sanpete and Sevier counties that they were in for
<span id="page-??"></span>
223 War Whoops

another year of trouble. Many rumors were heard
of depredations that were to be committed in the

spring, such as; -- ''When the snow is gone the
Indians are going to get mad, east, west, north
and south!"' Thus, having tormented the settlers

in the far south of the territory off and on all
winter, the redmen began moving north in early
spring, In large numbers they came from south
and east, filled with new vigor and determination
to massacre and mutilate the white settlers, - or
so it seemed, ''Tue. Mar. 19th 1867, an attack
was made upon Glenwood and the pioneer black-
smith, Merrit Staley, was killed and many of
their livestock were taken. While some believed
that the audacious Black Hawk was leading the
raiders here, most historians know it was the
daring Chief White Horse,"' -- "Mar. 21st, Early
in the morning Jens Peter Peterson and his wife,
Charlotte Amelia, with Mary Smith, a neighbor
girl, left Richfield with ox team to go to Glenwood
about five miles east to do some trading, having
left their 18-months old baby girl with Mary's
mother, Stores were few and Glenwood had one
of the largest, In order to obtain some needed
supplies, these people had ventured out, thinking
that by starting early there would be no danger;
though it was contrary to counsel for anyone to
travel between settlements without armed escort,
Because it was muddy they could not travel as fast
as they had expected, When they came to the so-.
called 'Black Ridge'> east of the Sevier River, -
Indians were gathering stock along the river’
bottom, The redmen immediately attacked and
killed Peterson and his wife. ._Mary Smith, shot
through the arm, jumped’ from the wagon and ran
down the hill; but as she got to the bottom an
Indian shot. her through the. back, The savages
scalped the man and’woman, mutilating their bodies
terribly, then leaped down the dugway to finish off
the girl, Finding she had curly hair they left her
scalp, as they were very superstitious of curly
hair, They filled her wounds with rabbit brush,
These atrocities were soon discovered and the
citizens of Glenwood took after the Indians and
gave battle, The Indians, however, were vic-
torious and also succeeded in getting away with
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 224

about one hundred more head of stock', Such
reports shocked all who heard them and Brigham
Young, much concerned, counseled the bedeviled
settlers to move north into older and stronger towns
for safety.

Thus nearly all settlements on the upper
Sevier and all in Kane and Piute counties were
deserted by their inhabitants, Teams were sent
from Manti, with a company of minutemen, to
assist in moving all the residents of Glenwood and
Richfield into Sanpete county. A policy was
inaugurated placing all the livestock of the occupied
settlements in Sanpete under strong guard both night
and day, for these animals meant life to the com-
munities in more ways than one, Companies of
militia were sent in from the north to assist in the
struggle, making their headquarters in Manti as _
they had the year before, General Snow was
released as head of the Sanpete military district,
which comprised all of southeast Utah, and General
W. B, Page took his place. A ''get tough" attitude
was taken against the warring Indians, for the
settlers were determined to have peace and safety
or the extermination of every Indian throughout the
land. The militia were authorized to kill every Indian
buck who came on their trail and to spare only the
squaws and papooses,

But if vigilance was relaxed in any degree,
neither the cattle guards nor the military were any
more safe than others, as was evidenced by the
following: -- "At Fountain Green it was customary
for a guard of at least ten men to be with the cow-
herd, On the morning of June Ist 1867, however,
only five men were with it, the others having been
detained in the settlement. As feed was plentiful
the herd was taken only a short distance from town
to graze. Two of the herders were stationed nearby
on a knoll below which their horses were feeding,
The other three were on the other side of the herd
in a hollow by a ditch, cleaning some rabbits they
had just killed. Those on the knoll saw ten persons
riding fast from the east hills towards the herd, but
thinking they were the additional herders, paid no
more attention until the oncoming riders began
shooting in their direction. The Indian group divided
<span id="page-??"></span>
225 War Whoops

as they drew near the outnumbered herders, six
of them riding toward the two on the knoll who,
having no time to warn their companions, rode
quickly away for help, The other six Indians came
upon the unsuspecting three in the hollow, shot
young Lewis Lund in the center of the forehead at
close range, wounded Jasper Robertson in the
thigh but missed the third man, Then they took
off with the herd. The body of Lund was later
found, his powder-burned face down in Water
Hollow ditch.'!' The very next day, June 2nd,
between Gunnison and Manti, at Twelve Mile
Creek, another melancholy incident occurred.
"Major John W. Vance, together with Capt. Miles,
Sergt. Heber Houtz and Pvt, Nathan Tanner Jr.,
were just returning to Gunnison from a military
drill in Manti. At dusk, while halting at the creek
to water their horses, they were fired upon by
ambushed Indians at close range, At the first fire
Maj. Vance and his horse fell dead and Sergt.
Houtz, with a groan, also fell from his horse as
the animal wheeled suddenly out of the creek,
Miles and Tanner, believing their companions to
be dead, headed back to Manti for help in recover-
ing the bodies, Later, Vance was found where he
fell, pierced with two bullets, but Houtz had evi-
dently recovered himself momentarily, after the
first fire; for his body, shot with two bullets and
seven arrows, was about five hundred yards from
the scene of ambush,'' The savages always gave
good measure when it came to shooting. If these
tales seem remote to us, like something out of
Cooper's novels, we should remember that these
Danish progenitors of ours were very near to
these things and perhaps more deeply involved in
them than we can imagine, It was only with great
fortitude that these people were able to save their
lives and homes from these savage intruders,

Winter being a good time to work at building,
it is likely that young Christensen and Myrup went
about building shelters of some sort for themselves
and their wives, on plots that had been alloted them
within the confines of the Big Fort. Whether these
were of rocks, logs, or merely dugout ones, is not
known by us, One-roomed log cabins with possibly
a lean-to each seems logical, They doubtless had
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 226

help from others of the established settlers and by
spring of 1867 were able to move into their own
quarters - their first real homes in the Valleys.
That spring as well, Christen, Anne and the three
girls came down from Moroni, where they had spent
most of the winter; traveling in a company escorted
by armed guards, as advised by the Prophet Brig-
ham Young. Quarters for them were needed too,
Perhaps they moved in temporarily with the two
couples, or it may have been with Danish friends,
while a house for them was erected,

Manti became a beehive of military activities
again that spring and summer, with the Legion
companies from the north marching and maneuver-
ing to the sound of fifes and drums, and sometimes
dashing off here and there on their mounts to the
aid of stricken settlers or quickly forming into
battle lines if the big talking-drums warned of
approaching danger to the Big Fort itself. And not
to be outdone, the local brethren, who were organ-
ized into various companies called the "Silver Grays",
gathered each morning onthe Tabernacle Block for
early drill, summoned forth by the call of bugles,
Individual assignments for each day followed as
some were detailed as picket-guards for the town,
others as members of scouting groups to search
hills and cedars for signs of skulking 'Injuns",

Still others were charged to guard those who worked
in the fields, or in the hills at logging, while others
acted as minutemen, whose duty it was to be off and
fighting at a moments notice should the bass drums
call, Then there were always those sent to guard
the town herd. At a given time each morning dur-
ing the growing season, all the town cows would be
brought by their owners to the stock enclosure on
Tabernacle Block where well-armed guards would
take them to pasture for the day's feeding.

Laurs Christensen and Lars Myrup both
served with the Sanpete militia, first under
General Warren Stone Snow and later under
General Page. Christen Christensen himself also
served in the Black Hawk Indian War, even though
he was well past forty-five when men could be
released from that military duty. (Nearly twenty
years after his death his wife Anne received a pension
<span id="page-??"></span>
227 War Whoops

settlement for his service in that war,) Knowing
the caliber of these Danes we can be pretty certain —
they never shirked any duty as sagebrush-soldiers,
As they filled their various assignments each day,
little could they have known that years and years
later one of the sons of Laurs would wed a grand-
daughter of this same General Snow.

Laurs was a private in Captain John H,
Tuttle's co,, Utah Militia Infantry, One day he
was one of a number of guards detailed to take the
town herd to graze near Warm Springs, south of
Manti, for here the grass grew lush and green
from early spring to late fall. On this particular
day the horse Laurs was riding became frightened,
jumped sideways and reared up, throwing him off,
while one of his feet still remained caught fast in
the stirrup, The horse then started out on a run
and it looked as if he were to be dragged to death,
when suddenly his shoe gave way and he was
released, bruised and scratched to be sure - but
safe! On another occasion Laurs was sent to
drive a team of horses and covered wagon carrying
some supplies from Manti to the settlement of
Ephraim, some six or more miles north. As far
as we know he was alone on this trip, When he
came within a mile or so of his destination his
attention was drawn to the foothills on his right.
where he could see some horsemen approaching
ina cloud of dust. It wasn't a moment until the
wild whooping of the riders struck him with stark
fright - "Injuns!'' -- there was no mistake.
Quickly he tied the lines to the wagon box or seat
somehow and slipped down onto the wagon tongue
between the then thoroughly frightened horses,
trying to calm them and yet urging them on faster
and faster in almost one and the same. breath, ;
Soon the Indians came within range, pulled their.
bows and let fly in his direction, piercing the
wagon box cover and drivers seat over and over
in a rhythmic tattoo of arrows, From his hidden,
awkward position Laurs could also hear the arrows
whizzing over the backs of the animals above his
head, A merciful heaven must have been on guard
that day for he and the team reached the outskirts
of Ephraim and safety, unscathed by the redmen's
darts,. Although Laurs was cramped, lame and in
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 228

a state of shock, he recovered and was soon
returned to his home and family again, safe and
sound inthe main, If Else fussed and worried
over him and his narrow escapes he probably
passed it off in such a manner, -- ''There's no
need to be afraid my dear! Haven't I told you
time and again that no Injun buck will ever wear
my curly-haired scalp?"

There were sometimes things more to be
dreaded than Indians, In July of that year, just
when the new crops began looking most promising,
grasshoppers came in clouds so thick as to darken
the air. They ate everything green and growing in
their paths, They were particularly bad in Sanpete
Valley for a period of two or three weeks, Men,
women and children were called out every day en
masse to fight with shovels, brooms, switches, |
aprons - anything they could wield to try and kill
them or drive them away. When the 'hoppers were
finally gone there was little left of the crops, A
food shortage was bound to follow. But pigweeds
grew profusely near Temple Hill and dandelions
too - both made tasty nourishing greens, Young
milkweed stalks seemed as good creamed as
asparagus, Dainty Sego Lillies, called ''Lanterns
of the Fairies'' by the pioneers, grew quite
abundantly on the foothills near Manti. Their
bulbs could be dug up and eaten raw, cooked, or
ground into meal for bread making, All these
helped out many a dire food situation in those
early days,

If Else was worried, fretful, and not quite
her sweet, courageous self that summer and fall
of 1867, she had some reason to be for she was
expecting a little one. Anne was expecting also
and both were hoping for sons, as were their
respective husbands, Christen especially wanted
a son, which was quite understandable with so
many girls in his household already. The two
women spun and sewed and made little quilts and
garments together and talked of their coming con-
finements; neither knowing which would be first.
Anne, though older, was as unaccustomed to child-
birth as Else; to both of them it was a mystery

fathomed only by the experienced, As their times
drew nearer a midwife was approached and spoken
for. In the meantime the fathers-to-be doubtless
fashioned small wooden cradles and dreamed be-
times of their unborn sons, Maren had consented
to do the cooking and extras for the two households
besides looking after her three young sisters,
while Anne was lying-in, although she and Lars
Myrup had hoped to go north with the Conference
goers that October to see the magnificent new
Tabernacle in which the meetings were to be held
for the first time. It was to be a glorious occa-.
sion, Everyone said the new structure, 250 feet
long, 150 feet wide and 68 feet from floor to
ceiling, with its immense roof arched without a
pillar, and its great pipe organ, was one of the
wonders of the world,

Sat, 28 Sept, 1867, Christen and Anne's
child was born, a healthy baby girl whom they
decided to name Caroline, This was Christen's ©
eleventh child and seventh daughter but only Anne's
first, Six days later, 4th of Oct., in another one-
roomed log cabin within the confines of the Big
Fort in Manti, Else presented Laurs with a curly-
haired son. Why Laurs got the son and his father
another daughter ‘tis hard to tell. Perhaps he
remembered to sleep with an ax under his bed
while Christen forgot, It should be comparatively
easy to remember the date of the little boy's birth,
since it was just two days before the October Gen-
eral Conference convened in Salt Lake City, at
which time the new Tabernacle was dedicated,: 6
Oct, 1867, Laurs and Else decided to name their
boy Christian, Baby Christian was undoubtedly
given his name and blessing on Fast Sunday in
November at a meeting in the Council House on
the Tabernacle Block. Petrine Christensen was
likely. confirmed there also following her baptism,
since she turned eight in Manti that year of 1867.

Ed

At General Conference in Salt Lake City
that October, other business besides the dedica-
tion of the new Tabernacle was taken care of: 163
missionaries were called to strengthen the settle-
ments in southern Utah, and all the Saints in Zion
were called upon to assist liberally the following
<span id="page-??"></span>

year towards emigrating all the poor Saints from
Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, No
church teams had been sent to the Missouri River
for the poor that year, because of the Indian trouble,
in consequence of which the immigration of members
to Zion was comparatively small, Anne was anxious
to send money to her sister in Denmark so that she
might come, and Christen promised to get around

to it as soon as he got his feet on his own ground,
Lars Myrup too was eager to have his father and
step-mother and their children come; but it turned
out to be many years before this was accomplished,
Else's thoughts must also have turned to her people
in Jutland, But it was useless to think of them in
connection with the church, or any other way now
for that matter. Not until she could tell of some-
thing besides poverty and hardships would she even
bother to write them, for she was proud and they
would be slow to understand such things, Yet the
call of home reached out to her in voices unstilled
by time and space,

It was known that Chief Black Hawk, who had
gained for himself the title of the ''Red Marauder",
had been gravely wounded at the battle of Gravelly
Ford in June 1866 but it was rumored that more
recently he had contracted tuberculosis and in his
weakened condition was loath to continue the hard
life he had been pursuing. In the fall of 1867 he
indicated he wanted to make peace, At a meeting
with Colonel Head, Superintendent of Indian Affairs
at the Uintah Indian reservation, he unbosomed him-
self, again expressed a desire for peace and asked
Superintendent Head to cut his hair for him in token
of his abandonment of the warpath, and promised to
induce as many as possible of his adherents to join
him in peace, Preliminaries having been accom-
plished, the proud Chieftain seemed anxious to
make amends to the people of Utah before death
overtook him,

Thus, on April 5, 1868, believing Indian
hostilities were over and that it was safe to return
to their deserted homes, a company of 22 men, 4
boys and 15 wagons started on their way to re-open
the settlement of Monroe in Sevier County. They
had been cautioned against possible Indian attacks
<span id="page-??"></span>
231 War Whoops

however, Early in the afternoon they found they
were being followed by Indians, so immediately
corraled their animals to prevent a stampede and
prepared for the worst, The Indians dismounted
and took to the cedars which formed a kind of
horseshoe bend around the place. From this point
they fired upon the company, killing Lars A.
Justesen, a Danish emigrant, After two hours of
fighting the Indians returned to the hillside, Riders
were sent out to Gunnison and Richfield for help
but the Indians pursued them and succeeded in
severely wounding Adolph Thomson, When word
reached Gunnison a party of twenty-nine men went
immediately to their assistance, They also came
upon the body of Charles Wilson, who had been
murdered by the Indians near the scene of the
other attack,

'So in spite of Black Hawk the war continued,
although the renegade Indians who kept at it in
Sanpete and Sevier did not make as nw ny attacks
as the previous years, The energy and vigilance
of the militia had their effects upon these wily
foe and they saw their prospects of raids in safety
and success fading, But accustomed as they were
by now to feasting on the cattle of the settlers,
many grew fretful at having to stay within the safe
limits of their strongholds subsisting on crickets,
grasshoppers and an occasional game animal, So
some continued their raids - safe or not. Espec-
ially the young chiefs and sub- chieftains were
rebellious and defiant and boasted not a little of.
their prowess and deeds of blood, These young’
warriors were loath to "bury the tomahawk" or
eat humble pie by creeping back into. the good
graces of Uncle Sam and the settlers as Chief -
Black Hawk had done, Also, in the south, north ~
and east, the Shiberetch, Capotah and ‘Elk Mountain
Indian bands, as well as the turbulent, Navajos, .
were still on the warpath and troops were kept on
scouting expeditions against them, ~All in all the”
Indians continued to make things sufficiently dis-
tressing for the settlers most of the year 1868,

It was a strange paradox that while the
settlers continued their war against the redmen
on the one hand, they were earnestly laboring to
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 232

make peace with them on the other. Treaties
were signed with various Indian leaders here and
there, even though they continued to be broken by
the redmen and perhaps some whites, Yet pro-
gress towards peace in the valleys was being made
notwithstanding, One of the most important treaty
meetings for the people of Sanpete, save the one
with Chief Black Hawk the year before, was held
in Strawberry Valley, Uinta Co, in August 1868,
Here Superintendent F. H. Head again met with
Black Hawk, but this time the Chief had a number
of his sub-chiefs with him, They had a "heap big
talk" which lasted nearly all one day. The talk
ended in the signing of a peace treaty by the whites
and Chiefs Augavorum (the White Horse Chief)
Tamarita and Sowahpoint and a few others, urged
on by Black Hawk.

In Sanpete at Ephraim a few days later, nego-
tiations were continued and details of the peace
worked out, In attendance in the town's bowery
were the above named chieftains as well as Black
Hawk, numerous young Indian braves and quite a
group of white settlers, The fact that some of the
redmen came with their faces painted black, war
clubs slung on their wrists and pistols hidden under
their blankets lent a rather eerie effect to the scene.
Apostle Orson Hyde, an emmissary of peace for
the Church, presided and the boastful, insolent
White Horse Chief acted as spokesman for his red
brethren. In eloquent defiance and with much dis-
dain he made his accusations and demands, often
with contemptuous gestures, but the whites refused
to be ruffled. At length their cool diplomacy,
together with Black Hawk's encouragement, over-
came the resistance of the assembled Indians, At
last the party moved to a nearby lawn where the
Indians seated themselves in a circle and passed
around the pipe of peace, Hundreds of dollars
worth of blankets, gay calico, tobacco, trinkets
and other articles were distributed to the eager
Utes as the price of peace, Thus the treaty was
concluded and comparative quiet settled upon the
valley.
<span id="page-??"></span>

The Christensens had been looking forward
to October General Conference that year, It was
to be quite an occasion for Christen and Anne as
they planned to have their endowments and be
sealed to one another for time and eternity in the
Salt Lake Endowment House while in the city.
Maren and Lars Myrup had been thinking about
it also, but again they were deprived of going
because they had a tiny daughter of their own and
were loath to leave her in another's care, The
little girl had been born five weeks following her
mother's nineteenth birthday, 22 Mar. 1868, in
the Myrup's log cabin in the Big Fort. They had
taken her to Fast Meeting in the Council House
for her blessing and given her the name of Mary,
the American name for Maren, It is doubtful if
Laurs and Else went along that year either, with
young Christen just a year old and crawling into
everything. They must have cared for little
Caroline also, to leave Anne and Christen free,
and probably helped with the girls too, since
Maren must have had her hands full with little
Mary.

Christen and Anne went to Salt Lake by
covered wagon, along with a company of other
Conference-goers, You may be sure they had an
armed escort along, as skirmishes, stock thefts
and even killings continued, even after the treaties
were signed. Though there was supposed to: be
peace, no wise settlers ever traveled about unpro-
tected; it didn't pay to take the chance. The com-
pany left Manti early since it still took almost a
week to get from there to Salt Lake City. On Sat.
Oct. 5th, in the Endowment House, Christen and
Anne were given their endowments ‘and sealed to
each other. The gentle Karen, Christen's first
wife, was also sealed to him for etérnity, although
her endowments had to be postponed’ until a temple
was erected in Zion in which to do work for the
dead. General Conference convened next-day,
Oct. 6th, in the new Tabernacle and lasted three
days. It was the first time a full quorum of ~
Apostles was ever present at a Conference in
Utah, Apostles Franklin D, Richards and Charles
W. Penrose having just arrived in Salt Lake from
their foreign missions, It is likely that Brother

Penrose's hymn 'O Ye Mountains High" was fea-
tured at this Conference,

If April Conference the following year, 1869,
was considered by Laurs and Else, the idea came
to nothing since Else was expecting again and too
near the time to take a chance on so long a journey.
On June 6 that year she gave birth to another fine
son, He too was born in their log cabin home in
the Big Fort at Manti; for though some people were
now moving out of the fort and building homes on
their own adjoining farms, yet a number of the
Scandinavians planned to move on farther south as
soon as Indian troubles became a bit more settled,
and among these were the Christensens, So they
remained on in the Big Fort for awhile longer,
This baby must also have been christened in the
Council House at Manti. He was given the name
of Andrew, American for Anders, after Else's
father. Can't we just see Else cuddling the wee
one, as twenty-months-old Christian clung to her
skirts, vying for attention?

Andrew was born just twenty-one days follow-
ing the laying of the last rail and driving of the last
spike (gold) that joined the Union Pacific and Central
Pacific railroads, completing the Great Pacific
Railroad into Utah. This long hoped for event took
place at Promontory Point near Ogden, 10 May
1869. No more were church wagon trains sent
east to the big rivers to bring in the immigrating
Saints since they could now come all-the-way-to-
Zion-in-comfort (or so 'twas advertised), Right
away ground was broken for the start of the Utah
Central Railway, a branch road to be built from
Ogden to Salt Lake City. Later on other railway
systems, including the Utah Southern Railroad,
Denver and Rio Grande, etc., were built to other
parts ofthe Territory. Numbers of the settlers
were given employment on these projects as time
went on, helping them to supplement their incomes
and giving them other means with which to barter
and trade, besides their livestock and farm pro-
duce. Thus the coming of the railroad to Utah
brought prosperity along with it, and 'business
began to boom",

Yet things were anything but ''booming" for
<span id="page-??"></span>
235 War Whoops

the Christensens, Myrups and some others of the
Scandinavian immigrants then living in Manti, for
they had not yet become firmly settled in Zion.
These were still waiting for the cessation of
Indian troubles, or at least for the time when they
themselves could feel safe in moving farther south
and taking up land, Skirmishes, stock thefts, and
even killings had gone on. Even as late as 26 Sept.
1872,- when Daniel Miller was killed and his son
Dan Jr, wounded near Bernard Snow's mill not far
from Spring City, Sanpete County, where the two
had gone for lumber, were the Indians still to be
feared, Though this incident was conside red by
some to be the finale of the Black Hawk Indian
War, it was well nigh impossible to tell just when
this war.really ended. __ :

It had been a costly one for the young Terri-
tory. It was estimated that, counting the loss of
livestock, expense of military supplies and ser-
vices, as well as the breaking up and ré-establish-
ing of numerous settlements, the cost had run to
more than one-and-a-half million dollars during
the four years 1865-1869, Looking back on it,
some concluded that a bale of blankets and a few
sacks of flour here and there, distributed to.the
redmen inthe proper season, might have accom-
plished more than their weight in gold expended
in military operations, Would the people then
never learn about the ways of peace and war?
However, these early settlers learned teamwork
and cooperation through it all. There were many
fine examples of sacrificial giving which helped
to unite these people in a bond of brotherhood
and common ideals.

The last incidents of this destructive war
were carried out by rénegade Indians and in no
way involved Chief Black Hawk. When he signed:
the peace treaty and persuaded his sub-chiefs and

‘braves to do likewise, he was determined to have
no more to do with war and the killing of whites,
and he stuck to it. To prove this he decided to
visit every town and settlement where his warriors
had caused trouble or raided, in an effort to |
'make peace with the people", So he obtained
permission from the proper authorities to-do this.
<span id="page-??"></span>
War Whoops 236

Thus, sometime before his death, with a few of
his warriors and a military escort, the notorious
Black Hawk visited every town and village from
Cedar City on the south to Payson on the north,
in an attempt to make peace with the whites and
win their forgiveness. A revealing account has
been given of his visit to Fillmore, in Millard
County, the latter part of April 1870, when he
appeared at a Sunday meeting before a highly
expectant audience;

"With head erect and dignified steps, as
unperturbed as a white General, Black Hawk,
preceeded by the Bishop, marched to the platform
and was seated, After preliminary exercises he
was introduced and the object of his presence
stated, Personified dignity in every movement
and gesture, the Pah-Ute Chief deliberately arose
and, avoiding the pulpit, stood on the side of the
platform near his interpreter and spoke exclusively
in Pah-Ute, although he could speak English quite
well, The slowly dying chieftain rapidly rehearsed
the story of his early grievances:--how the white
invaders had taken possession of the hunting and
fishing grounds of his ancestors; of the insolence
of some of the white men and of the whipping and
occasional killing of some of his warriors, The
speaker seemed to have few regrets for his raids
in Sanpete and Sevier, He denied complicity in
some of the murders of which he had been accused
and expressed sorrow over others, saying that the
raids were forced by the starvation of his people
and that, had he been so inclined, every white man,
woman and child could have been massacred. He
concluded his speech with a not too repentant plea
for forgiveness,

'The Bishop then moved a vote of forgiveness
of their late enemy, who was preparing to meet the
'Great Spirit', and requested that the audience
express their views, On the stand was the father-
in-law of Samuel Brown who, together with Bishop
Josiah Call, had been murdered in the late '50's by
Indians, He broke the suspense by speaking
briefly against the motion, Then suddenly, turning
on the redman, he shouted, 'You black murderer,
you killed Bishop Call, the best friend the Indians
<span id="page-??"></span>
237 War Whoops

ever had, and you murdered Sam Brown for the
money he was carrying - you black devil! I will
NOT forgive you,' But to this the once dreaded
Chieftain never 'batted an eye', A voice vote was
then taken - one grim 'NO' and the Chieftain once
known as 'The Red Marauder' was absolved from
mortal responsibility for his active belief in the
ancient law ' an eye for an eye and:a tooth for a
tooth", L

It has been said that at his best Black Hawk
was a fine looking Chief, his appearance being
different from that of the other chiefs, He was
tall and wore long feathers, His nose was long
and he wore a small moustache and looked as if
he had Jewish blood in him. He also had three
nice looking squaws. But Black Hawk was not at
his best physically during the last years of his
life. It must be remembered that he had been
wounded in battle in 1866 and that tuberculosis
had set in sometime after and was taking its toll.
He knew that it wouldn't be too long before he
would be going home to die, and before the end
came he desired to be at peace with the pale
faces, The proud Black Hawk's repentance may
have been brought about by his weakening condi-
tion, but:on the other hand it may have .been forced
by mental anguish. As he began losing his health
and strength, the once powerful Indian must have
recalled again and again a long-gone meeting with
the ''Great White Chief" Brigham Young, to which
he had been summoned in an attempt to get him to
walk the ways of peace, In surly contempt he had
paid the Mormon leader no heed, even after he had
leveled his finger at him and uttered these prophetic
words;-- "If you continue to shed the blood of
Mormons you shall wither and die!"

‘No one can tell the exact date that Black
Hawk went home to his wigwam and gave up. his:
life to join his fathers and the Great Spirit ina.
better land, Nor can anyone now living tell just .
when he was buried in his Spring Lake Villa south
of Payson in Utah County. But before he died he
became a living skeleton, having wasted away to
almost nothing. He knew it was because he had
killed the white men. That he was a red man of

some courage cannot be denied, and begging for-
giveness of the whites, or ''eating humble pie" as
the Indians called it, undoubtedly took as much
courage as all the battles he had ever fought put
together, Lightly flint-tipped arrows, heavily
feathered for long range shooting, heavily-tipped,
lightly feathered ones for short’ range, and some-
times poisoned arrows tipped with venom from
the fangs of the rattlesnake, were among Chief
Black Hawk's earthly weapons; but in the land of

the ''Happy Hunting Ground"! -- who knows, .. .?
Kk ok ok Ok

As the year 1869 drew to a close in Manti the
big drums seldom beat out warnings anymore and
the Indian warwhoops had mostly ceased; but the
sensations connected with those beating drums and
blood-curdling yells must have lived with the
settlers the remainder of their lives, For the
majority of the Utah pioneers the 1, 100 mile trek
from the Missouri River had not been too unplea-
sant, with some exceptions such as the Abner
Lowry Company. Solving the problems of settle-
ment and establishing home in an unconquered
wilderness was the really great challenge - the
supreme test of their ability and integrity. To stop
in the middle of settling and fight an Indian war had
been demanding. Three thousand young men had
been on call for military duty and served without
pay. Those who stayed at home had furnished food,
weapons, ammunition, horses, saddles and other
equipment, Muster rolls and other expenditures
had been compiled, for it was expected that the
national government would reimburse the settlers
for the time and money spent, but it did not. The
one-and-a-half million dollar cost of the war was
largely met by individual sacrifice. Even the
smaller settlements were allotted their share of
the expense plus what they suffered in loss of
cattle and horses, Thus for some time many were
in an impoverished condition, The need for sharing
worldly goods was not over until well after the war,

The Christensens and Myrups, intent upon
moving to a less crowded area, had their hearts.
set on Gunnison, approximately fifteen miles
southwest of Manti. Some of their Danish friends
<span id="page-??"></span>
239 Gunnison Valley

were already settled there and prospects for them
taking up land in that settlement were said to be
very good, It was virtually believed that Indian
raiding and killing were over, at least while the
winter snow barricaded the canyons, keeping the
redmen out of the valleys. Preparations were
gotten underway in their various households: but
there was one thing more that they were awaiting
before they left Manti, This event took place on
the eve of Christmas, 24 Dec. 1869,. when Anne
presented Christen with a long-awaited son, It
was quite natural that they should choose the name
of Christen for this new child, in honor of his
father but perhaps also in memory ofthe other .
son Christen who had stayed behind in Old Denmark,

4, SINKING ROOTS IN GUNNISON VALLEY

Whether it was the forepart of January 1870,
as soon as Anne and the new baby were able, or
later on that year, when the three families hoisted
their belongings into their white-topped wagons and
headed south we cannot be quite certain, Early
Gunnison Ward records give the following:-- 'Lars
(Laurs) M. C. Christensen, son of Christen
Christensen and Karen Lauritzen, born 22 July
1847 in Kobberod, Tyland (Thyland) Denmark;
bapt. 8 May 1865 by Lars. N. Myrup; confirmed |
same day by same; received Gunnison. Ist month
1870,"' But Laurs and Else, with their two sons,
are recorded as still living in Manti at the taking
of the U. S. Census there 25 June 1870. It is”
possible that Christen and Lars Myrup and their
families went along in the early partiof the year
and Laurs and his family came later-on in 1870. ..:
Whenever they went that year, however, it was:
likely with a cow tied to each ox-drawn wagon,
and penned up inside somehow some chickens and
perhaps a pig, with a few sheep being driven along-
side, Picture our Danish kinsfolk as they traveled
along thus, varying in ages from 52 year old
Christen and 31 yea old Anne, to two year old
Caroline and a few weeks old Christen, .Lars
Myrup was pressing 25 and Maren, expecting
again soon, was almost 21, while small Mary
<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 240

was a year and ten months, Laurs 223 and Else,
just short of 23, had two year old Christian and
seven month old Anders to keep contented. Then
there were the three girls who were growing up
indeed, for Pauline was a young lady of nearly 15,
Petrine almost 11 and Nielsine (Sena) 7$.

_ From Manti around the Red Point and past
Warm Springs to Six Mile, then on to Nine Mile,
from thence they continued south, turning west
before reaching the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek
where it joined the Sanpitch River, Then they
wended their way across the meadow road follow-
ing the course of the Sanpitch as it ran to meet the
Sevier River west of Gunnison. Long chains of
high hills watched in the distance, craggy crimson
peaks jutting sharply at intervals, To the east,
towering above the nearby White Hills, were the
majestic Wasatch Mountains. Far to the west,
lofty blue mountains made a backdrop for grey
hills while nearby, a little to the south, stood
Chalk Hill with its varying shades of beige, buff
and yellow. On all sides were expanses of sage
and rabbit brush, denoting the fertility of the soil.
So the Christensens and Myrups came to the little
town of Gunnison prepared to sink their roots in
the valley and make the most of their inheritance
in their 'Promised Land",

Gunnison, first settled in 1859, was named
in memory of’a wonderful friend of the Mormons,
Captain John William Gunnison, U. S, topographi-
cal engineer, who was killed by Indians near the
Sevier Lake in 1853, Captain Gunnison once wrote
his observations of the Great Basin and its inhabi-
tants in expressions such as the following: -- ''In
these contiguous vales are the gardens of the moun-
tains, located in that remarkable depression styled
the Great Basin - out of which no water flows...
The atmosphere is light and breathing is a real

luxury. From the kanyons the breezes at night
_ are ever fresh and strong. . . The cheerful,
happy faces and the strains of music pouring
forth from merry hearts, give an impression of a
happy society. , . The ascending sun salutes, and
descending bids a short farewell each day, kissing
the snow-capt brow of the lofty peeks that look so

serenely down upon these vales filled with happy
homes of peaceful industry. . . The dignity of

labor is held sacred by the Saints, they teach by
example what they preach on the Sabboth. , .'"' .

The very first group of settlers coming into
Gunnison Valley had settled south of the Sanpitch
River where it curved abruptly to the west around
Chalk Hill point, The second group who came
some months later saw the luxuriant, grassy
bottoms between the Sanpitch and the Sevier and
so, north and west of the other group, they began
a new. settlement below a long curve in the San-
pitch and south of little white hill ledge, They
called this ''Kearns Camp'), ''Sevier City Rocky
Point" and 'Hogwallow''in turn, Their fields
were laid out in eighty acre blocks with roads
four rods wide between them, These blocks
were then divided into ten acre lots and each
settler was allotted his share according to the
size of his family. The first temporary shelters
were dugouts, usually 12 by 16 feet, made deep
‘in warm mother earth and covered with willows
and sagebrush plastered with mud, A fireplace
witha chimney sticking tall above the ground was
built in one end of each and in the other end a
ramp or steps led down to the door or entrance.
Nearly all the cooking was done from pots sus-
pended from fireplaces fed by fat pine wood, whose
light was a fine substitute for candles, Furniture
was made of slabs, poles, split-logs or broken
wagonboxes; Clothing was sometimes made from
tents, sacks or bed ticks, and making over from
large to smaller was a common task, Rawhide
or buckskin, secured from the Indians, was used
for making harnesses, shoes, bed cords. and even
fences, For rhending, | leather was used for almost
everything including broken wagons. cand machinery.
The work to be done was accomplished coope ratively.
Making ditches, planting and harvesting crops, —

making roads ‘and building bridges,” cutting and
hauling wood and logs for houses were some ‘of
the major jobs to begin with, Soon log cabins were
built and then the dugouts became milk cellars and
storage pits, The children worked at picking
berries, digging sego roots, or gathering succulent
weeds to cook as greens, The women sometimes
<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 242

sheared the sheep and carded, spun and wove the
wool or knitted stockings from it. They made
nearly all the family clothing from cloth of their
own making, '"Do it yourself" projects were the
only kind in those days in early Gunnison.

In the spring of 1861, Elder Orson Hyde,
who was presiding over that area, advised the
two groups of settlers to move together, Those
from Chalk Hill agreed to move to the lower site.
During the winter of 1861-1862 a great amount of
snow fell in the mountains and when it melted in
the spring the streams and rivers were swollen
by it and overflowed their banks in many places,
The settlers "turned out en masse and built a
dam!'! to divert the water away from their homes
and keep it from swallowing up the colony. Never-
theless the ground became soaked and soggy,
cellars filled with water, chimneys fell down, and
the whole place became nothing much but a "'hog-
wallow". When President Brigham Young and his
company came through there by ox-train that
September, he was shocked by the condition of the
land and advised the Saints to move east onto the
bench and there build a permanent city to be called
"Gunnison, '!

Without delay the new townsite was laid out
in eight acre oblong blocks, with wide roads be-
tween - 24 regular blocks and 54 fractions. Main
Street (now Center Street) ran east to above town
and west to Second West, then North. Before
winter set in some families had already moved to
the new location and by the summer of 1863 all
fifty families of which the place boasted had taken
up their new residences, All public buildings from
"the hollow'' were moved onto the bench, including
the meeting and school house which had been dedi-
cated on Christmas Day 1861. Built of logs which
had been sawed through at Lewis Bunce's mill, and
whitewashed on the inside with clay from Chalk
Hill, this 20 by 40 ft. room, with a door between
two windows on one side, spacious rock chimneys
at each end, a floor of boards, together with
benches of slabs and a pine wood table, not only
served for church and school in its new location,
but dancing and festivals as well,
<span id="page-??"></span>
243 Gunnison Valley

In May or June 1866 word was sent from
Brigham Young for the Gunnison settlers to move
their cabins in line for outside walls of a fort, No
sooner said than begun. Four blocks, numbers 13,
14, 20 and 21 (with the: middle intersection at .
todays 2nd West-on Center Street) were enclosed,.
Walls between the cabins were rocked up toa.
height. of. seven feet with peepholes. near the: top.

At each corner circular structures with many.
.peepholes served as lookouts for the watchmen..
There was.a substantial gate on each side in line
with the cross streets, A standing guard.was
maintained night and day. West, on Rocky Point,
a great pile of straw was heaped up ready for |
firing as a warning should any redmen be sighted,
Boys too young to stand ‘guard | ran errands and.
carried food and water to the men on duty.

“In the spring of 1867, when the Indians °°
renewed their sho cking brutality, all of the settle-
ments on the’ Sevier River ‘south of Gunnison had ©
been evacuated and many’of the evacuees were
welcomed to Fort Gunnison, — though some ‘cho se-
other settlements farther north.’ The people frovn
the area of Fayette to the north moved their log”
cabin homes into Gunnison Fort also, “At this’ >.
time President Brigham Young advised the ‘build-
ing of a more substantial fortification at Gunnison.
Militiamen at once commenced work on what was
_ designed to be a splendid structure, : ‘surrounding
the fort and enclosing twelve city blocks, ‘The —
two-story northeast tower of rock; circular in
form, reached a height of about thirteen feet,
the tapering walls of’ which, four feet thick at the
base, had small openings to shoot through.; This
fortification was never finished,: for. the need.for
it subsided before it could be. fully: accomplished.

Settlers came frorn’ both’ north and south to:
Fort Gunnison and as® ‘they came they were wele-<
comed and room provided for them, even house's?
built, Many of the military from ‘thé north were=
stationed there from time to time. A féw stories
that have come down to us from life in Gunnison’
Fort would not be amiss-here.' "After a few weeks
living within its walls, a letter was sent to Presi-
dent Wells (head' ‘Bf the Mormon ‘Battalion in | Utah)

ar

<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 244

asking permission to have the 'Kraals', Pig Stys
and sheep pens outside the fort to keep it from
becoming disagreeably unsanitary", which was
granted we suppose. Albert Tollestrup's diary
contains these excerpts: 'We children would go
through the big gate down to Sanpitch River just
one block away. With pin hooks and thread lines
we fished for minnows, We brought some home to
fry but we also ate some raw Injun fashion, ‘'Sun-
flower Hole' and 'Big Roundy' were swimming holes
close by and a mile west of Rocky Point was 'Izen
Glass Hole' where we caught water snakes and blue
racers. Ina puddle nearby there was good clay ©
out of which we made horsemen and Indians and
put them on the rocks to dry, It was fun to climb
to the top of 'picket guard' on Rocky Point. We
could see the Sevier River, the White Hills, and
all over town and away to Fayette, Willow Creek
and Salina.'' ''When Hans C, Hansen-was a small
child he was playing alone outside the fort walls
one day. An Indian picked him up and took him to
his lodge. Hans' mother saw the Indian take him
and followed anxiously after them. When she
reached the wickiup the Indian was giving Hans a
pair of moccasins, Luckily the Indian was a
friendly one and she was able to take the boy and
hurry home. Hans liked the moccasins and was
‘allowed to keep them.'"' Sometimes people were
not so fortunate. White children were occasionally
stolen and never found; at other times they were
kidnapped by the Indians and redeemed after a
lapse of time in payment for food, blankets and»
anything the minds of the redmen could think up.

In the early spring of 1869 the Gunnison
people moved their cabins out of the fort and onto
their own city lots, set out fruit trees, planted
gardens and started many improvements in an
effort to beautify their abodes, In April they
decided to start a co-op store in the settlement.
ZC MIin Salt Lake City had merchandise avail-
able for such projects, so Bishop Horne went
north to get a load of goods. When he returned
there was much excitement in the town, but the
little house or store wasn't ready for the wares
so they were sold from the wagon. In two days
the store building was ready but the goods had all
<span id="page-??"></span>
245 Gunnison Valley

been sold, so the Bishop went to Salt Lake for
another load, Other peacetime projects were
planned and a committee worked out the following
seven point program: '!(1) Division of the wire
grass bottoms, a lot to each family; (2) A system
of irrigation where needed and drainage for flag-
grass areas; (3) A schedule of labor to accom-—
plish the work; (4) Burning of old grass; (5) Survey
of lots and leveling of ditches; (6) Fencing; (7) Sow-
ing of improved red-top seed,"'

Upon taking up their residence in Gunnison,
Laurs and Else and their two small children were
eventually assigned a lot on what is now (1969)
about the end of Third West on First South, Soon
a small adobe house facing south was erected
there and later plastered white on the outside,

(It is still standing today.) Laurs must have also
been given some grazing land in the ''bottoms'' for
his stock, as well as some farming land somewhere
on which to begin planting. Assignments of labor
for him in that cooperative society, however, were
definitely not relegated to the days ahead but must
have been given right away and started as soon as
his family had been made reasonably comfortable.
It is supposed that the grubbing of brush and clear-
ing of his own acres was not long delayed either,
There is indication that Christen Christensen and
Lars Myrup were given lots in east Gunnison.

Thus these and other Scandinavian immigrants,
who in general had been reckoned to be rather
poor pioneers, settled down to become fine grass-
root settlers in the valleys of the mountains,

-In.the summer of 1870 Hans Thunnison,
postmaster of Gunnison, sent the following report
to the Deseret News in Salt Lake City: -- 'We have
but a small settlement of 90 families. The grass-
hoppers preyed heavily upon us the last years.
The losses sustained from them and the burdens
we have had to endure during the Black Hawk War
were equally severe - but we are improving, Our
fields at present look barren and desolate except
about 250 acres planted mostly with late wheat ©
which looks very promising and will, we hope,
suffice to feed the inhabitants of this place for the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 246

coming year, with the addition of peas, potatoes,
corn, etc., all of which appear to be doing well,
A new rock schoolhouse 24 x 24 feet wiil soon be
finished, With the good road now made up Twelve
Mile Canyon we expect a good supply of lumber,
The people seem to be well generally, the weather
is fine and as soon as the grasshoppers get wings
they take their fight to other parts,"

Time and events must have passed swiftly
for the Christensens and Myrups in Gunnison the
next few years, for when people are well and
working busily towards desired goals and succeed-
ing to some extent it is hard to keep track of the
minutes as they fly. Additions to the three families
seemed to have come along as fast as anything. On
1 Mar. 1870 Maren gave birth to her first son, He
was a tiny little fellow and they named him Lars
Christian Myrup after his father. (Later they
changed his name to Louis), A little more than a
year later, 7 Mar. 1871, Else presented Laurs
with his third son and they named him for the
Prophet Joseph, His hair was curly like his
father's and grandfather's and also like his brother
Christian's, though he was lighter complexioned
than Christian. Mar. 29, 1872 Maren had another
son whom they named Niels Christian Myrup, also
for his father whose full name was Lars Christian
Nielsen Myrup. Not to be outdone, Anne presented
Christen with another sonon 26 Apr, 1872. They
gave him the name of John Taylor Christensen in
honor of the Apostle.

In the late autumn of 1871, Laurs and Else
made their first trip back to Salt Lake City. It
must have taken at least a week each way, for
although Gunnison was only 149$ miles from Sait
Lake at the time, travel, with roads like they
were, was pretty slow even with a good team of
horses, Too, they had to stop along the way to
camp at nights, as well as other times to rest,
water and feed their animals, carrying that feed
along with them, and to prepare their own victuals
or ''grub!'', the makings of which they also took
along stowed away in grub boxes likely under the
seat of the wagon. Did they take along their sons

four months, and seven month old Joseph? 'Tis
most likely that they did and also that they were
accompanied by a number of other wagon loads

of Saints, since it was still not considered entirely
safe to travel alone or ina small group, for fear
of Indians,

The main purpose of this trip, as far as
Laurs and Else were concerned, was to enjoy the
great privilege of going to the Salt Lake Endowment
House and being sealed as man and wife for time
and all eternity... This sacred event took place —
30 Oct. 1871. There in Salt Lake City just prior
to this, or on 28 Oct,, Laurs was ordained an
Elder in the LDS Church, No sealings of children
to parents could be rightly performed until temples
were prepared in Utah to take care of those and
other holy ordinances, After having been sealed
in the Endowment House Else and Laurs, if they
remained true to the covenants made at that time,
would be considered worthy to partake of other
blessings in the House of the Lord, when one
should be provided, such as having their three
first born sealed to them for all eternity and also
to have the holy ordinances of baptism, endowment
and sealing done for their dead relatives,

Else must have been forcefully reminded of
this latter obligation when she received word of
her mother's death sometime after it occurred,
Mette Kirstine Christensdatter (Hvid) died Il
July 1872 in Norhaa, Thisted, Denmark at the.
age of 61 yrs. 3 mo. and 8 days. However, there
is some indication that correspondence and com-
munication between her and her loved ones in the
old country was not carried on regularly, in fact
hardly at all, until many years after her mother's
passing, Else's heart must have yearned to see’
her father and comfort him then, but she was
helpless to go. Surely though she wrote her
family words of love and consolation - and wept ©
betimes in longing to be near them in their
mutual sorrow,

In that year of 1872 another uprising of
Indians threatened, particularly in Sanpete.
Several Utah Indian Chieftains were taken to
Washington, D. C, to meet with United States
<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 248

President Ulysses Simpson Grant, where they
must have promised that the uprisings would
cease, for they did, in Utah at least, from then on,
Yet notwithstanding the possible danger from red-
men, and doubtless leaving their two small sons
with Else or Anne, Lars and Maren Myrup left
Gunnison that midsummer and traveled to Salt
Lake City by team and wagon. There in the Salt
Lake Endowment House, 15 July 1872, they had
their endowments and were sealed together for
time and eternity, These holy ordinances were
so important to the majority of the early Saints
that they were willing to sacrifice a great deal to
have them accomplished, Lars Myrup was fast
becoming a man of some consequence in the com-
munity of Gunnison, He had a way with people,
especially the Scandinavian brothers and sisters
who looked to him for leadership,

On Friday, 13 Dec. 1872, Else Christensen
gave birth to her fourth son. He was the first of
their children to be born under the covenant and
their first and only 'winter'' baby. He and Joseph
were each born in the small adobe house on First
South, Third West. They had this fourth son,
Albert Christen Christensen, blessed and named
by Bishop Joseph S, Horne 2 Jan, 1873,

Christen's eighteen year old daughter,
Pauline, was wed to Andrew Andersen of Gunnison,
also a native of Denmark, 12 May 1873, Their
endowments were had and their marriage consum-
ated in the Salt Lake Endowment House, He was
nearly seven-and-a-half years older than she,
That same year railroad building in Utah took a
spurt. By 25 Nov, the Utah Southern Railroad had
reached as far south as Provo, where a great
celebration was held that day. A railroad ina
town ended its semi-isolation and made easy con-
tact with the outside world available--thus there
was cause for rejoicing. Railroad building was
also a boon to the settlers in other ways, increas-
ing their incomes through contracts getting out
lumber for ties, etc., as well as for opportunities
to labor on the projects outright,

Else Kathrine always had an intense love for
education which is indicated in her son Albert's
<span id="page-??"></span>

account of her given in his autobiography, from
which we quote: ', , . As soon as arriving in the
United States she set about to learn to read English,
and while it was difficult to learn the language she
succeeded in being able to read and understand it
in avery short time, Needless to say, she was
exceedingly energetic in assuming the household
responsibilities, but aside from that she always
took an independent interest in public matters,

and especially in the health of the people in the
community and in the education of her children,
The two older boys were taught early to read so
that when they first attended school they were able
to commence in what was then called 'the third
reader', After her general housework was done
she usually engaged in carding and spinning, and
each day the children took their turns at the side
of the spinning wheel and had their lessons in
reading, While she was unable at first to pro-
nounce the words so that in that way she was not
only the teacher, but was also taught the pronuncia-
tion of English words, This love of education and
improvement was one of her outstanding charac-
teristics,'' The women all helped each other
according to their special talents, Cheerful co-
operation made the many working bees - sewing,
quilting, rug-making, apple drying, squash drying,
corn husking, etc,, - into social events. Else was
an excellent mixer for she was always sympathetic
and willing to ''go the extra mile".

The Christensen family clothing was mostly
fashioned from cloth of her own making or that
exchanged for sick duty and such, Excellent —
trousers for little boys could be made from seam-
less sacks and straw hats by picking out the finest
straw, soaking it in water until it could be braided
and then shaped over a pot or bowl to dry. Most
small children were scantily dressed in summers
and ran without shoes. Hand-loomed and ‘hand-
sewn clothing lasted a long time and could. be -..
passed down, or made over, sometimes for: gen-
erations, Women's shoes were often made from.
any coarse Cloth that they could find. Some were
fortunate enough to procure leather moccasins
from friendly Indians for a bit of wheat or flour.
Brigham Young once told the early settlers that if
<span id="page-??"></span>
Gunnison Valley 250

they would wear wooden-soled shoes most would
be free from rheumatics, or 'rheumatiz",

When Laurs first came to the valley he had
gotten down to nothing but white shirts and had
been forced to wear them to work in until more
practical ones could be made him, Thus he gained
for himself the title ''Chris of the White Shirt", He
was a hard worker, steadfast, dependable and so
very honest, Though naturally a somewhat quiet
man, he possessed a happy disposition and a
natural wit and sense of humor that helped to pull
his family over many rough places along the way.
He was extremely unselfish and gentle and kind -
oh so kind! He never struck one of his children
in anger and gave them but very little unnecessary
advice. He was immaculate in his personal habits.
He had a fine mind and was conservative and delib-
erate in his decisions and very practical, though at
times he may have seemed a little slow in making
up his mind. Indeed, Laurs was a splendid balance
for a wife such as Else who was sometimes impet-
uous, impractical and determined - yet withal
gifted with great vision, faith and dreams by
which she oft was guided, )

The year 1874 was full of experiences both
good and bad for the families in Gunnison and the
church in general. On 16 July Anne gave Christen
another son whom they named Andrew, the same
as Laurs' and Else's second, 24 Aug, Maren had
her third son and they named him Adolph Marinus
Myrup. So now Anne and Maren each had one
daughter followed by three sons, while Else had
four sons but no daughters, That she longed for
a girl child is easy to believe. July was remark-
able for much lightning, thunder and rainstorms,
Winds of hurricane proportions belted the area
causing much damage and some severe fires,

There was increased anti-Mormon and anti-
polygamy movements in Zion and an anti-Mormon
weekly newspaper, ''Utah Scandinav'"' began publica-
tion in the Danish-Norwegian language that October
but was forced to discontinue after three years run,
There were numerous excommunications from the
church. But, on the other hand, many Indians
were converted and baptized into the church that

year - whole tribes in fact, On July 24th a grand
"Juvenile Jubilee'' in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake
City where 4,000 young musicians and singers
participated to celebrate the pioneers’ entrance
into the valley some twenty-seven years before,
Work on Utah's first temple was pushed forth with
vigor in St. George, One of the most far-reaching
and important events of the year, however, was
the introduction and organization of the ''United
Order" principle which took place at the 44th
Annual Conference of the church in Salt Lake City
the forepart of April.

5, THE UNITED ORDER EXPERIMENT

In Gunnison the United Order was organized
April 3, 1874. Advice, rules and regulations
printed in circular form were sent out by the
church presidency and apostles, The Order was
reorganized in September and incorporated accord-
ing to law. About 300 persons, men, women and
children in Gunnison, mutually agreed to honestly
and diligently labor for the building up of the King-
dom of God and for the salvation of mankind,
"Their object was to create a higher standard of
living, lessen women's labor, better educate the
youth, adopt the best methods of farming agreeable
to location and circumstances, produce as econ-
omically as possible and assist and divide with
each other until all had plenty of this world's
goods,'' Committees were appointed for farming,
herding, butchering, merchandising, building,
lumbering, salt boiling, wood hauling, railroad
grading, and shoe, boot and harness making.
Provisions were made for education, music and .
singing. There was a special ways-and-means
committee and one for streets and ditches, Winter
work was threshing grain, logging, lime burning,
rock quarrying and freighting, along with other
pursuits of home industry," — .

Lars Myrup and his family joined the United
Order in Gunnison and were numbered among the
members there who consecrated their property, -
time and means for the benefit of all concerned.
Evidently Christen and Laurs Christensen and

their families were not among this group who
organized there in September 1874, Whether
they were slow in making up their minds or had.
some other reason we do not know, However, by
the end of the year, their problems were apparently
resolved in favor of 'The Order" and they were
ready to join forces with that noble experiment -—
but not in Gunnison, for they had decided to move
elsewhere, Thus, after five years of pioneering ©
in Gunnison, Laurs ‘and Else with their four small
sons, together with Christen, Anne, their three :
daughters and their three sons, pulled up their
roots and moved again,

As we know, the first inhabitants of Utah
were the so-called ''Children of Pride'', the dark
skinned people belonging to the mighty Ute Indian
or 'Eutaw'' nation, from which this state received
its name, The Ute nation was divided into numbers
of powerful tribes, each headed by a chief and
assigned a designated territory or hunting ground
over which it presided, Tribes were often divided
-into various Indian bands headed by sub-chieftains,
These Utes were athletic, hardy, impudent and
haughty, exhibiting in their makeup some of the
best and some of the worst traits of character
known to man, Their uncanny skill and courage
made them the best warriors in the west and
between tribes there were always conflict and
wars, It was traditional with them to love and
hate with vigor and so when the whites got in
their way they often took revenge,

When the pioneers first came to the valleys,
"Yakarah", anglicized to Walker, was Chief of
the main Ute tribe in the Territory and one of
many brothers, all said to be of noble birth, Two
of these brothers were Chiefs Sanpitch and Arapeen,
Chief Walker's favorite domain in general was the
Sevier River System, which included the extensive
five county region through which that river flowed;
but he traveled far and wide east and west, hunting
buffalo on the Great Plains, stealing horses by the
hundreds from ranches and Spanish Missions in .
California and New Mexico, as well as taking
scalps and prisoners and engaging in slave trade
<span id="page-??"></span>

as he went along extending his power and dominion,
His band of followers, numbering from 500 to 700
braves, were considered the aristocrats of the

Ute Nation and known far and wide for their
excellent horsemanship and their dexterity in
handling firearms, The reputation of Walker
himself excited a variety of opinions, It could

not be agreed as to whether he was good or bad,
though all pronounced him clever, A contemporary
of Brigham Young and much influenced by him in
the long run, Walker joined the Mormon Church

in March 1850 and later was made an Elder, He
eventually signed over much of his territory to -the
church, Though he and his braves fought and bled
the settlers in 1853-1854 in what was called. ''The
Walker War", he repented, we might say, ''on his
death bed'', Plagued with blindness for three days
before he died, Jan. 25, 1855, he pleaded with his
followers to keep peace with the whites, -

Walker's brother, Chief Arapeen, had pre-
viously laid claim to most of Sanpete Valley, from
Thistle on the north to Salina on the south, but
when Walker died, succeeded him as chief over
all his territory, Arapeen (Siegnerouch) hada _
special spot in Sanpete Valley that he loved above
all others and here he made his summer camp,
This beautiful, secluded area, surrounded by hills
and mountains, came to be known as Arapeen
Valley. It was an ideal setting for an Indian vill-
age and here Arapeen and his band came year
after year in summer, just as his ancestors of
many generations had done before him, Indian
folklore and tradition claim this to have been a
place of "ancient fortifications" -- who knows?

Zig-zagging westward through this valley,
headed for its rendezvous with the Sanpitch River,
ran Twelve Mile Creek, which the Indians knew as_
Aw wan ah voo. On the brink of a hill to the south,
overlooking the creek bottom, Arapeen pitched his
wickiup, below which his people cultivated and
made an "Indian Farm", Here, fed by mountain
and canyon streams, the land provided much to
sustain them besides farm products -- fruit, fish
and game. These Indians jerked meat to preserve
it, and tanned skins of animals with a high degree
<span id="page-??"></span>

of excellence, from which they made their wigwams
and clothing, Arapeen was as devoted to his people
as Chief Walker had been to his and had their wel-
fare at heart; thus often bitterly resenting the
encroachment of the whites on the streams and
lands of their fathers,

On the other hand, Arapeen was sometimes
very friendly and looked to the whites for help and
welcomed their assistance. We find him in such
a mood soon after he took over Walker's chiefship.
In May, 1855, he appeared at Manti and said he
believed there was room for all people in the area,
both Indians and whites, Feeling that he was the
rightful owner, as Chief of the Utes, of all the
land of the region, he deeded Sanpete County and
its water, timber and other assets, to Brigham
Young as trustee-in-trust for the Mormon Church,
-- ',,.for and in consideration of the good will I
have to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, . .'' The original and complete copy of this
deed, signed by Arapeen (Siegnerouch) with an 'X"',
and witnessed by George Snow (a son of Gen, Snow),
R, William Glen and John Patten, can be found
today at the Manti City courthouse, Notwithstanding,
Arapeen still claimed ownership at times of different
places in Sanpete, such as Warm Spring and the
grassy meadow near the site of Fayette, which he
bartered off to the first Bartholomews and Mellors
who came there to settle, They gave him two fat
oxen for the spring and some calves for the meadow,
or so we are told,

In a warm-hearted effort to cement peace
with the red brethren, Brigham Young, as Superin-
tendent of Indian Affairs as well as President in
Utah, set aside various parcels of lands as 'Indian
Reservations", where they could hunt and fish and
also cultivate and improve farming land to provide
them a better living. One of the most prosperous
of these reservations was a twelve mile square
area established around and including the well
watered and timbered Arapeen Valley. A number
of young men from Manti, including Moroni Voor-
hees, a brother-in-law of Gen, Snow, were sent
to live with the Indians on Twelve Mile. Here
they learned the Indian language, helped build
<span id="page-??"></span>
255 United Order

fences and bridges and taught Arapeen's people
"white man's ways'' with the land. One hundred
and ninety-five acres of land was under cultivation
at the Indian Farm there in 1858, which produced
about twelve hundred bushels of wheat besides
corn and potatoes that year,

Chief Arapeen died of smallpox on the moun-
tains between Sevier and Grass Valleys, as he was
returning from a good-will trip to the Navaho coun-
try, and not long afterwards the Indian Black Hawk
took over as the main Chief of the Utes in his area,
It was only a few years after that the Indians were
at war with the whites again, and as we should
recall, this so-called Black Hawk War was some-
what triggered by the bad temper of former Chief
Arapeen's son, Jake Arapeen. After the Black
Hawk War began, in the spring of 1865, the Indians
never came back to live in Arapeen Valley, though
some came back often enough to steal and kill.
During the war the deserted Indian village and
farm on Twelve Mile became a military camp and
a number of different cavalry and scouting com-
panies were stationed there off and on for three
summers, under the overall supervision of General
Daniel H. Wells. After hostilities were considered
over, the settlers once again began visiting Arapeen
Valley.

In the month of May 1870 Simon Hansen, Mads
Peter Sorenson and Carl Olsen drove their ox teams
from Gunnison to Twelve Mile canyon to cut timber
for homes and fences, They took the dirt road on
the north side of Sanpitch River going southeast
and crossed over below Chalk Hill, then followed
along the east side of the river to Twelve Mile
crossing (Christenburg) up past. the.''red hills"
around the lake to Arapeen Valley, , Lush Spring-
fed meadows lay to the north, The. ‘canyon stream
cut a well-willowed path through. the wide creek |
bottom. As they pulled up onto the south side of
the bench above the bottoms, a magic circle of
earth and sky, bordered by a panorama of hills
and mountains, surrounded them. Te the east
was Musinia (Mary's Nipple) and the Wasatch
Plateau, to the south the Glenwood mountain, to
the west, above and beyond the low hills,
<span id="page-??"></span>

Mt, Carharine and the Pahvants, and to the north
the Sanpitch mountains, visible as far as Thistle
Valley, Beneath their feet the fertile brush
covered soil was dotted with spring flowers,

White, yellow-flecked sego lilies, red Indian paint-
brush, blue flax, pink sweet williams, lavender
Sweetpeas, pastel sugarbalils, and vicid blossoms
of the prickly pear and many unnamed blooms of
golden hue vied for attention. This indeed looked
like the 'land of promise" to these young men in
their prime and they picked out their homestead

- sites on the north side of the creek, for the land
had just been opened up for homesteading by the
national government, When they returned enthused
to Gunnison and talked about the land, others were
impressed and planned to join them. When they
mentioned their intentions to move to Bishop Horne
and asked if he had any objections, he said he had
no real ones but hated to see them go for there was
much to be done in Gunnison,

The spring of 1871 the three men and ten
others formed a co-op and began farming at Twelve
Mile. They cut the meadow hay with scythes and
divided it equally. The next year they began
digging a canal and cut a ditch to bring water from
the creek to bring irrigation water to their land on
the north and west, Bounteous crops, hand weeded,
were harvested that fall and before winter had set
in some temporary log cabins were started, But
they had trouble off and on with the Indians, who
managed to steal their horses when they were
turned out to graze unguarded on the hills, Soon
they knew enough to tie them up to their wagons at
nights. A Conference was being held in Gunnison
just before the middle of June 1872, and being eager
to attend, the men left 15-year old Niels Heiselt to
watch their horses, When they returned next day
they found Niels dead, shot by Indians as he sat by
the wagon eating his supper, and their horses gone,
This shooting occurred 14 June.

In the early spring of 1873 the three men,
Hansen, Sorenson and Olsen, brought their wives
and small children to Arapeen to live. They were
soon joined by other families, The ditch was
extended on the north division and more land was
<span id="page-??"></span>
257 United Order

broken up to meet the needs of the growing settle-
ment, On the bend of the creek the trees, shrubs
and turf were cleared of dead branches and in the
delightful nook a bowery was built. Meetings and
socials were held there and picnics and games
were enjoyed in the shade of the tall cottonwoods,
The "old swimming hole'', screened by squaw
berries and birch, provided pleasure on hot sum-
mer days, and here the family water barrels,
mounted on two wheeled carts in summer and
bobsleds in winter, were filled as needed from
the creek,

For the next few years, beginning on Sep-
tember 14, 1874, most of the families living there
on the north side mutually agreed to live by the
rules of the United Order ., to reverence Deity .,
pray with families and in secret ., keep the Word
of Wisdom... treat families with kindness and
affection ., set an example worthy of imitation .,
observe personal cleanliness ., observe moral
cleanliness in speech and action ,, keep the
Sabbath day holy .. to not appropriate for use
that which belonged to others ., return all that is
borrowed .. cancel indebtedness as soon as
possible ., patronize the Order and combine
labor for mutual benefit,

When the U. O. Articles of Association was
recorded at the Sanpete County Courthouse in
Manti that mid-September day, it was necessary
to select a name for the new settlement, Harking
back to the beauty of the place during the month of
May they called it Mayfield, The Articles also _
insured ''a twenty-five year contract for mining, —
manufacturing, commercial and other industrial
pursuits -- building wagon roads, irrigation |
ditches, colonizing and improvement of lands,
establishing and maintaining schools, churches, ,
libraries and any other benevolent, charitable or.
scientific associations consistent with the Consti-
tution of the United States and the laws of the...
Territory. '' Officers were to consist of a presi-_
dent, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, |
appraisers and directors, Each monthly meeting
of the membership was to be conducted by a chair-
man selected from those present,
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 258

The United Order in general had been set up
as a reform movement within the Church and
inaugurated by President Brigham Young. He
preached about it at General Conference and at all
the settlements through which he traveled, The
qualification for membership was not the amount
of property possessed by the individual, but his
standing in the Church and general good conduct.
No one was admitted except those who put all they
had into the association, The question of capacity
to render valuable service to the group was not
considered; the Gospel theory and practice of ''the
strong aiding the weak'"' was recognized and carried
out, that the whole community might rise together,
In most places the initiations of the ''Order'' were
accomplished by a renewal of the covenant of bap-
tism; Brigham Young and his counselors setting
the example at Ephraim, Utah July 17, 1875, The
original "Law of Consecration'' as introduced in
Missouri by Joseph Smith the Prophet in 1831-34,
was not strictly followed in any instance,

In Sevier Stake, of which Gunnison and May-
field were than a part, the organization of the Order
came nearest to the original and proved the most
successful, First set up there right after April
conference in 1874 under the direction of Brigham
Young's oldest son, Joseph A, Young, who presided
over that Stake, it grew in popularity until eight
settlements in the Stake were involved and two-
thirds of the membership steadily working in it.
Most kinds of work was done by contract, based
on cash prices, and the surplus credits occurring
from a man's labor, over what he drew for the
sustenance of himself and family, added to his
stock in the organization. When a member wanted
a house built and hadn't quite enough stock or credit
to pay for it, the Order built it for him and when
his credits increased he paid the balance back.
Besides the general stock, the members had
"stewardships" which were separate and which
included their homes, city lots, domestic animals,
etc,, which by industry and tact they could put to
good use in procuring extras, the substantials
being furnished from the Order's source of supply.
Thus the system was considered one of the best
mutual associations in existence,
<span id="page-??"></span>
259 United Order

In Else K. Christensen's journal she wrote: --
'We were baptized into the United Order in 1875,"
It must have been the very first part of 1875 how-
ever, that our two Christensen families from
Gunnison moved to the settlement in North May-
field and joined the Order there, for inthe minutes
of that Association for January 1875 we read --
"Resolved that we employ Elsie (Mrs, Lauritz)
Christensen and Marie C, Erickson to superintend
the milking of the cows in the company herd, and
divide the milk according to the members of each
family... etc.'' The minutes for February 1875
included the following: -- 'A township, 640 acres,
is being located on the south side of Twelve Mile
Creek, . . Resolved to ask President Joseph A,
Young to counsel us in regard to moving our
improvements to this location (they did not move)
. . » Considered letters from those asking for
membership in the Order. . . It was decided to ©
trade some horses for cattle. . . Resolved to
buy a Wood's Self-rake reaper", These are typical
U. O, minutes, the originals are now in possession
of a Mr, Hansen of North Mayfield, a grandson of
Peter H, Hansen, then secretary of the organization,

Most of those early North Mayfield homes
were built of logs. The Christensens' first homes
there may have been temporary willow-covered
extensions to their wagon boxes until log cabins.
could be built for them, But the families must
have been safely settled before long that mid-winter
in acceptable, though modest, quarters, since all
were to share alike in the Order, at least as far =
as the essentials were concerned, They had: .:.:
brought ali they owned with them, which must have
been little enough, and consecrated it to the Order,
having disposed of what they could not, bring. » On,
the other hand the spiritual gifts they brought > --
along must have been great, for they were people.
of strong faith and deep humility in the main. :
Their spiritual blessing must have been increased
many-fold there, especially for those of them who
sincerely sought to consecrate their very lives,
as well, in an all-out effort to keep:the divine laws,

In the Mayfield Order land was divided into
fifteen acre pieces, considered then to be worth
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 260

between 4 and 5 dollars per acre, with water enough
to water it being brought in ditches from Twelve
Mile Creek, Each man labored for himself after
spending so much time for the Order. He was paid
or credited in the organization for all time spent
over and above that which was required. The
amount of wages was decided by the directors,

with most men receiving full time pay and a few
not quite so much. Women were given three full
days pay for every six worked, and children were
also recompensed for their efforts. A fifteen year
old boy received a house and lot in the Order. Sloth
was considered a deadly sin. Oxen were used for
farming purposes, as Brigham Young advised, be-
cause they were about 50% less expensive to keep
than horses, (It was estimated at the time that it
took 200 bu. of oats per span of horses yearly and
$6.00 to keep them shod,) Oxen were also con-
sidered better than horses for working in the
timber, The skins on their legs were tougher,
they were less excitable in precarious situations
common to the logging business and they handled
better on long trips up and down the canyon or over
the steep rough terrain of the timber country,

Else's longing for a girl baby was satisfied
two-fold when on Monday 8 Mar, 1875 twin girls
came to bless the Christensens in their small log
cabin home in North Mayfield. The babies were
frail and Laurs called in W. N. Tofte to assist
him in giving them names and blessings right ~
away. Brother Tofte named the first one, Elsie
Kathrine, for her mother and she lived, Laurs
named the second Mary Karen, in memory of his
mother, but she died that same day. They always
called her ''Karrie' when they spoke of her after-
wards, Laurs undoubtedly fashioned a small
casket of wood, which they lined with softest
homespun, and laying the wee corpse gently
inside, buried it in the freshly dug earth behind
their cabin. Anne was probably called to assist
with the other little girl and with Else, while
Laurs looked after the four boys as best he could.
And though they grieved for small Karrie and what
might have been, yet they must have been comforted
in the belief that she had gone to join the gentle
Karen in Paradise,

261 United Order

That spring some twenty-one families moved
from the northern town of Ephraim and settled on
the new townsite south of Twelve Mile Creek,

This place was at first jokingly called ''New
London!" for one of the English-born women in the
group but was actually South Mayfield. The
families here did not belong to the Order, but
living conditions in the two settlements were
much the same, The homes at first were mostly
small log cabins with rough lumber shanties in
the rear, later used for granaries, In addition

to caring for her family and helping with the hard
work of building new settlements from scratch,
each pioneer mother there waged a constant war
on the lizards, snakes and rodents that would
share her dwelling in spite of all she could do,
South Mayfield grew rapidly and though there was
much competition between the two settlements,
they also cooperated in building mills, roads,
ditches and other mutually helpful improvements,
as well as buying large machinery together for

the benefit of both. It is said those on the south
side called those on the north ''the Orderites",
while those on the north called the south folks

"the Skinnykites'', When one left to cross over the
Indian Farm and Twelve Mile Creek from one part
of Mayfield to the other he likely would be heard to
say, "I'm going over to the other side",

About the first of July that year the proud
old Dane, Christen Christensen, had endured about
all he could take of ''the Order". So he pulled out
and took his family back to Gunnison, He had put
all he owned into that experiment, which had been
little enough - a few horses, cows, pigs, chickens,
a wagon and perhaps some small machinery - not
many who joined had more to give. But he took.
much less than that out, the sum total of nothing
except his family's personal belongings - not even
one cow to furnish milk for his children,

Lars Myrup furnished them with an adobe -
dwelling not far from his own in East Gunnison
and most likely with sustenance as well, until
Christen could get to producing again. It was a
blow to the older man's pride to have to depend
entirely on others, even for milk for his family;
<span id="page-??"></span>

he having been so long successful and independent
and one to whom others looked for aid. A story is
told of Christen at that time by his granddaughter,
Florence C, Hougaard:-- ''One morning the family
was seated at breakfast when they heard the mooing
of a cow close by. They had no cow - so they went
outside to see, Behold it was one of their own cows
they had been forced to leave behind in "the Order",
Old Bossy had followed them back to Gunnison,
They were overjoyed and Christen locked her up

in their corral right away. Speaking of it later the
old Dane said, ''I don't know for sure if I did right
or not - but I felt the hand of the Lord was in it!"

Though some left the ''Order'' from time to
time, others moved in, If Laurs had been tempted
to pull out at the end of six months, when his father
did, something restrained him, Perhaps it was the
courageous, determined Else, Needless to say,
they stayed on there and continued to labor hard
to provide for their growing family as well as to
contribute their share and more in building the
organization, Homes were plastered on the inside
with sand and lime. Ceilings were made of cheap
factory and were whitewashed along with the walls,
either with lime or with chalk from Chalk Hill.

Men made their furniture or obtained it from the
Order, whose carpenters were always busy,
Tables, benches, chests, shelves, cradles and
beds were made from logs hauled from the moun-
tains and milled at the lumber mill. Bedsprings
were made mostly from rope. Mattresses were
straw ticks or feather beds. Home spun blankets
and quilts made from worn clothing kept the family
warm, Pine and cedar from the surrounding moun-
tains kept the wood-burning stoves fed, Wool from
the sheep was used for making blankets and clothing.

So life went.on, and in the Order much that
went on was mapped out in the various monthly
meetings of the association, from whose minutes
we again quote: July 1875, 'Met in the Bowery.
P, C, Christensen appointed to keep order in the
company yards and corrals... Resolved to
instruct those who attend the chickens to prepare
the eggs for shipment (by freight wagon). .

"Resolved to put floors in the houses, one room

in each house first. . . Resolved that we subscribe
for two copies of the Deseret News semi-weekly

- » « etc, , , etc, . .'' There was so much plan-
ning to do in the Order that monthly business
meetings sometimes lasted from early evenings
until 3 o'clock in the mornings,

Brigham Young was a great colonizer, an-
inspired leader and an outstanding personality;
in truth he was one of the world's great benefactors
and is so considered by many today. A few of the
untold number of helps instigated by him for the
benefit of his people were the Immigration Fund,
lasting peace with the redmen, railroad building,
the United Order, and University and Temple
building. The Church grew and flourished under
his leadership, as he went from city to city and
settlement to settlement meeting with and instruct-
ing the Saints, The last few years of his life there
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 264

were a number of things took place that particularly
affected the people of central Utah and Sanpete
County. Besides the final settlement of the Black
Hawk War in 1872 and the establishment of the
United Order 1874-75, there was the completion

of the Southern railroad to near the north border

of Sanpete, as far as York, Juab Co, 18 Feb. 1875;
the founding of the Brigham Young Academy at
Provo, Utah Co., 16 Oct, 1876; and the breaking

of ground for the temple at Manti, April 25, 1877.
Numerous Stakes and Wards all over the church
were reorganized and new ones formed in 1877
under his direction, Mayfield was made a Ward
and taken from Sevier Stake into the newly formed
Sanpete Stake, 4 July 1877, both the north and south
sides being included in the new Ward.

The last minutes of the United Order in May-
field to which we have had access are the following:
January 20, 1877. "Special meeting called. .
the President laid before the stockholders the
following: If they would be in favor of selling our
farms and remove as a company to Arizona. . .
Resolved to let the question rest until we get more
information in regard to it, . . Minutes read and
accepted, Benediction Hans N, Tuft, Adjourned
sine die. Secretary Peter H. Hansen.'' These
may have been the last minutes kept by that organ-
ization in North Mayfield, for it wasn't long before
the Order broke up there. Numbers drew out their
stock, gave up their stewardships and moved, some
to New London or South Mayfield and some else-
where, Still some continued to live on in "the
Order", as North Mayfield was called, although
the organization was abandoned as such, and some
of the descendants of these still live there today.
The United Order movement generally did not get
a fair start. Several factors contributed to its
early abandonment: first, membership in it was
voluntary and numbers in each area were not
willing or not considered worthy to enter the Order,
thus two classes were created in the Church, which
was undesirable; second, there was lack of uni-
formity in the movement as well as the vigorous
leadership which was withdrawn when the Prophet
Brigham Young's health began failing; third, the
great influx of non-Mormons into the territory and
<span id="page-??"></span>
265 United Order

the increasing complexity of community life,
which produced friction, By the time of Brigham
Young's death, 29 Aug. 1877, the majority of the
Stakes and settlements had given up the United
Order, including North Mayfield, but the Stakes
and Wards of the church continued to grow and
flourish and railroad, college and temple building
went on.

Laurs and Else Christensen and their family
were among those who went over to the other side,
By some means, Laurs procured a lot on the south
side of Mayfield, or in New London as it was then
called, The property was located some east and
south of the public square there, Whether he
home steaded it, or purchased it from the govern-
ment, we are unable to say, Nevertheless he
became the first recorded private owner of that
lot, for we saw an abstract of the deed, Though
it was not recorded as belonging to him until Jan,
5th 1880 (when it was all paid for or other terms
of the contract with the government had been fully
complied with) we know he moved onto the property
at least two-and-a-half years before that,

A three-room adobe house, facing west, was
soon built on the premises and before Sunday, 8
July 1877, the Christensen family had moved in.
On that particular day Else gave birth to a fine
black-haired baby girl. They selected the name
Emma Eliza for this little one but it wasn't until
4 Oct, 1877 that they took her to the church there
and had her blessed, Bishop Ole C. Olsen of
Mayfield Ward blessed and named her, On that
particular day also, the baptisms of Christen and
Andrew were taken care of by the Bishop's coun-
selor, Henry Jensen, Christen had just passed
his tenth birthday (Oct. 4) and Andrew was four.
months past eight. The baptisms were undoubtedly
held in the waters of Twelve Mile Creek and it is
a good guess that their mother Else was not present,

Laurs also secured a small farm in the fields
near town. His credit in the Order likely supplied
him with little more than a wagon and team of oxen,
a milch cow or two, perhaps a horse, along witha
few tools and possibly a plough; his stewardship of
cabin and lot, etc,, having gone with the Order,
<span id="page-??"></span>

With the few chickens, pigs or sheep the family
may have accumulated, plus their meager furniture,
bedding and personal belongings, their total poss-
essions then must have been scant indeed, The son
Albert, in his recollections which are included in
"The Hard Rich Soil" had this to say on the subject:
"After leaving the Order and settling in South May-
field, the family had to do without all of what were
considered the luxuries, and at times some of the
necessities of life, With a large and growing
family it became a struggle to make ends meet,"

Laurs labored on his small farm to raise
what he could. He planted, ad looked at the sky
for signs of rain, for there were dry years when
water was scarce as well as wet years when the
floods came, There were years when the snows
came early, before the crops were ready to harvest,
and there were years when summer came late and
planting was delayed or when early crops were
nipped by frost, Laurs worked at other things
too - herding sheep, hauling logs and timber, rail-
roading, ditch digging, road grading, freighting,
odd jobs - anything he could do to bring in a little
extra pay in produce, script or cash - but cash
was scarce, Sometimes he worked on shares,

His skin was tanned and weather-beaten as he
labored in all kinds of outdoor weather to provide
for his family. He worked for the benefit of the
Church as well, dedicating time and.effort in lieu
of money, getting out timber from Twelve Mile
Canyon for the building of the Manti temple, build-
ing roads over which the timber could be brought,
or any other thing that his toil could supply for the
raising of that holy structure, Temple buiiding in
Zion was a cooperative undertaking and all good
Saints were loyal to the cause. Working for the
Lord and one's self and family was a joy. It
wasn't work that wore a man down - but the worry
and fear of failing.

Else did her share, She was vigorous, cap-
able and determined, for she had many dreams for
her children, She, with others of the pioneer
women there, sheared the sheep, carded the wool,
spun the thread and wove and dyed the cloth. With
her wool-cards, spinning wheel, knitting needles
<span id="page-??"></span>
267 United Order

and loom, she made and sewed by hand most of
the clothing worn by her family, as well as her
own, Dyes found in berries, brush, bark and dog-
wood could add a variety of color to the handmade
articles so, together with her young children, she
went into the field and hills gathering rabbit brush
for yellow and bark and berries for a variety of
browns and reds, She made rugs to cover her
floor from rags or wornout clothing, torn into
narrow strips then sewed together and woven on

a loom. . .

When she needed soap to help keep the family
and the home clean, she saved wood ashes ina
large barrel, poured water over them and caught
the drippings, added these to scraps of fat she had
hoarded and boiled them up together. Then after
much stirring and many skimmings over the hot
fire, she set the mixture by to cool and harden,
to be cut up into bars of soap afterwards. Water
with which to clean and wash, as.wellas drink and
cook, had to be carried mostly from the irrigation
ditch that ran near by. (They.caught soft water in
rain barrels under the eaves.) Washing of clothes
was done by hand with homemade soap and plenty
of hard scrubbing on the washboard, The ironing
was done with stove irons, with a special fluting
iron for ruffles on skirts and bonnets, Their
clothing differed greatly from our present day
scanties; for though boys' summer clothes might
have come under that category to some extent,
female clothing in particular bore very little.
resemblance to that of the present, Long full
skirts, dragging the.ground, tight long mutton
sleeved waists, warm-shawls, petite bonnets tied
under the’ chin, and high button’shoes were high
style for women in those days - but not all could
afford to be in fashion, Clothes had to last a long
time and be durable as well as fashionable, Hand-
me-downs and made-overs were much in style also
in early Mayfield and Gunnison days.

The boys of the Christensen family had much
“worth remembering in those South Mayfield days,
for though poor in worldly goods perhaps, they
were rich in the association of "caring parents"
and each other and the developing experiences of

childhood, Again we draw from the rememberings
of Albert: -- 'In our home in those years we had
family prayer mornings and evenings, Our mother
was a great person, She seemed to be able to tell
our thoughts. She always knew just what to do if
_we got sick or hurt and somehow she didn't seem
like other women, ... Our father was the most
patient and kindest of fathers and never throughout
his lifetime touched a child of his in anger. A
happy childhood home and the memories of that
home are worthwhile companions for a young

boy. . . Our home was always a place of love and
peace, Contention or quarreling was uncommon,

"One of my early recollections concerns a
momentous event in the life of any boy in this
western country, Father bought us a pony. It
was an experience of ownership in common, Many
delightful hours were spent in riding this most
precious possession in the world, In the beginning,
-the great thrill was riding behind one of my older
brothers, it being deemed unsafe for me to ride
alone, This limitation at least at first was accepted
without protest. To feel the exhilaration of a gallop
up the road into the mouth of Twelve Mile Canyon,
to see the willows and trees passing behind us as
we surged ahead over the lively feet of this wonder-
ful horse, was a great thrill.

"The Black Hawk War was over before my
time (the year of his birth actually), but it was
very much in the minds of all of us, Tales of the
Indian depredations often were the entertainment
of both children and adults. Frequently the older
children would 'play Indian'. Sometimes I had

-troubled dreams, One evening about sundown I
was out in the yard with some other boys. Some
Indian stories were being rehearsed by one of the
older boys. While I was between the house and the
boys one of them yelled, "There they come!" I
was immediately stricken with the most violent
fear and ran into the house screaming and sobbing,
Despite the reassurance of my mother as she held
me on her lap, I could not be calmed. For years
afterwards in the dark, especially in the mountains,
I frequently had to overcome the same feeling.

"One day later on I was ‘riding double' behind
<span id="page-??"></span>
269 United Order

my brother, It was a beautiful day in early sum-
mer when the air was balmy and laden with the
smell of pinon pine, cedar and flowers along the
way. But the joy of riding soon vanished. Immed-
iately ahead there came toward us a band of
Indians, swinging their blankets and ‘whooping it
up' in regular Indian style, We turned the pony
and sped towards home, I clung to my brother in
terrible fright. Soon the Indians were upon us.
Further efforts to escape were useless, We
slowed our pace and, numb with fear, awaited
what it seemed would be an inevitable doom. To
our great surprise the Indians passed by and as
they did so one of their number said in a rather
pleasant voice, 'Hello bub, did you get scared?!
After recovering from the excitement I found that
one shoe of my only pair had been lost, Notwith-
standing its great value, we had no immediate
desire to go back to find it, Later efforts to locate
the shoe failed, For the rest of the summer I went
barefoot, which was the custom in Mayfield among
the children generally. The lack of shoes did not
deter us from freely roaming through the fields
and along the foothills,

‘When I was a little older, Indians became
more familiar. Considerable numbers camped a
short distance south of the village. Often in the
groups of Indians were boys of my own age - 60r
7 years old, From time to time, with other boys,
I visited the camp and engaged in playing, and at
times wrestling, with Indian boys my size, The.
grown-up Indians took great delight in the sport,
especially when an Indian boy would throw one of
us, At such times they would yell and applaud, .
but would become silent and detached when an
Indian boy was thrown, (After Mayfield was
settled, Indians often came, spending a week or
two in town gathering food such as flour, pork and
eggs, They often brought dried venison to trade. }

"Later when I could ride alone I learned that
a boy makes a poor hitching post. My father and
some of the older boys were working on a 15-acre
farm about a mile east of Mayfield. They were.
ploughing with old Tom and Jerry, a yoke of oxen,
I rode the pony up to the farm. As the sun warmed
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 270

the earth and air, I got sleepy. I decided to take
a nap onthe warm land. Itied the rope that held
the pony around my waist to make sure he would
stay with me. However, my peaceful slumbers
were abruptly ended as I found myself sailing over
the ploughed ground at the end of the rope, with the
pony running hard and as frightened as I, The
chase ended without serious consequences, Ido
not remember what, if anything, my father said
to me about the matter, Knowing his life-habit

of never volunteering needless advice, I am sure
he said little or nothing. He probably knew that
the experience had made sufficient impression,

"One fine day in late summer or early
autumn, the four of us brothers, Chris, Andrew,
Joseph and I, who often roamed the foothills and
fields together, were roaming the fields and acci-
dentally ran across a watermelon patch, The sun
was warm and the field was dry as far as water
was concerned, The temptation was strong to
satisfy our thirst with a fine watermelon, which
we did. We were sitting there so engaged when
Jim Whitlock rode by and saw us eating the water-
melon, He evidently knew whose patch it was as
he promptly notified our mother that we were
raiding the Bishop's watermelon patch. When we
came home in the afternoon we were confronted
with the charge of stealing the Bishop's water-
melons (Bishop Ole C, Olsen), Our mother was
a firm believer in not letting wrongs remain long
unsettled, so as might have been expected under
the circumstances, she told us we must go down
to the Bishop's place, about two blocks away, and
'make it right with him,' A vigorous demurrer
was interposed against this, but we were very
firmly told not to expect anything to eat until we
had made it right with the Bishop. None of us
was hungry, and at the time it seemed to matter
very little whether we got any dinner or not, (We
were still full of watermelon!) But we soon learned
that melon fullness does not last long. We went
about our play, but when the sun was beginning to
reach the west hills we thought about our supper,
Knowing that mother meant what she said, we
called a council of war. It was unanimously
decided to go and see the Bishop.
<span id="page-??"></span>
271 United Order

"We started down across the public square,
then covered with sagebrush, proceeding in Indian
style, Chris leading the way, Andrew next, then
Joseph, and I toddling along in the rear, I suppose
I felt most secure as I was the last one in order to
meet the wronged Bishop, However, we arrived
at the log home of Hannah, second wife of the
Bishop, Chris knocked rather lightly and, as we
feared he would, the Bishop answered the door,
We were invited in and he asked us what he could
do for us, The truth was hesitantly told and we
all joined in giving assurance that we didn't know
it was his patch, that we wouldn't do it again and
that we hoped he would forgive us, Breathlessly
we awaited his response, We didn't have long to
wait for he exclaimed, 'God bless you boys!' And
then he called, 'Hannah, go down to the cellar
and get these boys some melons, ' Hannah did so
promptly, bringing up four large melons, The
Bishop patted us on the heads and blessed us as
though we were real heroes, We went home happy
and really grateful to the Bishop and to our mother,
We had our supper that night with a satisfied con-
science, but as I recall we ate no more water-.
melon that day, :

"There was another experience that we
enjoyed at serviceberry time. In the fall of the
year when these berries were ripe, the women
and children of the village went up into the hills
east of Mayfield, where the bushes were numerous
and generally loaded with fruit. This was the prin-
‘cipal fruit available there at that time, Usually,
kettles and cans and all manner of other containers
would be taken along, Sheets and canvas were
spread on the ground, The branches from the
bushes would be broken off or cut down, then
shaken over the sheets and canvas, Whenthe _
containers were filled with berries, it would be
a tired but happy group that would return to town,
Generally, the winter supply of fruit was obtained
from this source, supplemented by chokecherries,
which were also plentiful inthe hills and lower
slopes of the mountains,

"In the summer of 1878 there came into my
life an experience which impressed me with the
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 272

fact that we are not wholly alone, and that there
are some things inexplicable about dreams.
Through this and other experiences I have come

to believe without doubt that warnings are some-
times given to people through dreams, One
morning at breakfast time mother told us that she
had had a dream about me and the big irrigation
ditch that ran past our home on the north, with a
foot-bridge across it, She told us that she dreamed
that she was standing on that bridge looking at the
water in the ditch as it flowed rapidly westward
and under the bridge. All of a sudden, upstream a
little way, she saw my hat come floating. She
hurridly stooped down from the bridge to pick it

up and when she did so, there was my face under
the hat. She said that she then awoke and was so
worried about the dream that she couldn't go back
to sleep. She was afraid that something would
happen to me if I didn't stay away from the water,
Of course, I promised that I would be careful. A
few days afterwards mother told us that she had
had another dream about the same as the first
except that she was standing on the bridge across
Twelve Mile Creek, which people crossed enroute
to North Mayfield. As she was looking at the
stream she saw my hat floating down toward the
bridge about as she had seen it a few nights before,
She rushed down to get the hat and as she picked it
up, my face was under it, That morning she
appeared more worried than ever and told us all,
and especially me, not to go near the ''creek", as
it was called. . . Very soon after the two dreams,
mother told us of another dream which she had in
which she was again on the bridge which spanned
this same creek, She again saw my hat and under
it my face, as she had seen it before in her dreams.
We all promised to be careful around the water and
not go near the creek, After a time however, as
nothing unfavorable happened, the excitement about
the dreams was more or less forgotten,

‘Before this it had been common for my
brothers and me, with other boys, to go fishing on
the creek with our string lines and pin hooks, The
'Big White Hole' was especially popular. Here
the water entered the hole rapidly and the white
foam would often cover its surface in different
<span id="page-??"></span>
273 United Order

sized patches as clouds occasionally cover the
blue sky. . One day, some time after the dreams,
Jim Paulson, Jim Whitlock and my oldest brother
Chris came to the place and it was there decided
to go down to the creek for a swim, Chris was

the oldest and I was the youngest of the four boys
present at the time. It was Chris' job generally
to take care of me, so I toddled along with the
other boys over the 'Indian Farmland', We ended
up at.the swimming hole. The three other boys
were good swimmers, It didn't take long for them
to slip off their clothes - whether or not they had
shoes on has escaped my memory; probably not.
For some reason the three went upstream for
seventy-five to a hundred yards to another hole.

In the meantime, I decided to paddle around in the
water but I had difficulty in getting my shirt off as
it buttoned down the back; try as I could I couldn't
get it unbuttoned, It appeared that the button was
larger than the buttonhole! I decided to go to
Chris for help. As the bank of the creek was
smoother on the north side, I determined to cross
over. The water didn't seem deep just above the
swimming hole where the water flowed rapidly.
About all I remembered was that I slipped and fell
and in an instant was in deep water, Everything
went black and then I had a faint feeling of floating
in the air, The next thing I knew I was on the sand
bank on the other side of the swimming hole with
my brother and the other two boys. They were
working my arms and legs and moving me around,
It seemed a long time before I could walk. Then

I learned what had happened, When the three had
come back to the swimming hole they couldn't see
me and they called, Receiving no answer, they
looked frantically about and finally saw my white
hair in the middle of the whirlpool, Jim had leaped
into the pool and dragged me out, As soon as I felt
better I was carried over to where our clothes
were, When we were dressed we proceeded toward
home, Chris holding one of my arms and one of the
other boys the other, As we walked along my
strength returned and by the time we got home
Iwas all right. We decided not to tell of this
experience as we knew it would worry especially
mother," (And Chris, Albert and Jim Whitlock

never did. However, years later, during the con-
struction of the Denver and Rio Grande railroad
through Utah, when the project was proceeding
across the desert east of Price, Utah, Jim Paulson
gave the long-kept secret away. He was working
on the railroad there with Albert's father, Laurs,
and one evening around the campfire asked the
older man what ever happened to his son Albert
who was nearly drowned in Twelve Mile Creek.
When Laurs showed great surprise, the whole
story was divulged to him and later through him
to Else. )

Education in those early days in Utah was not
compulsory. Citizens in each city, town or village
handled the problem of educating their children in
their own way. Education of their children, how-
ever, was one of the first interests of most pioneer
parents, With Else Christensen this was particu-
larly true, and she taught her own children herself
at her knee until other schooling was available -
ahd even afterwards, Her deep interest in the
culture and training of the mind carried over into
the lives of most of her sons and daughters. It
wasn't until the family joined the Order and moved
to North Mayfield that Christian and Andrew started
school. However, both had been so well taught by
Else in the home that when they were ready for
school they were in their ''advanced readers",
Martha Hansen, wife of Simon, took the Order-
children into her home and gave them their first
school there, It wasn't until after the United
Order was abandoned that the teaching of children
was held other than in private homes in Mayfield.
Joseph must have started school first in New
London (or South Mayfield) the fall of 1877, also
in a private home, for it wasn't until 1878 that a
rock building 35 x 23 feet was erected there on the
northwest corner of the public square for school,
church and all public gatherings. Albert told of
his first educational training outside the home
thus:-- 'I started District school in Mayfield in
the fall of 1878, when five years old. (He turned
six in December.) My first teacher was Gus M.,
Clark and school was held in the meeting house."
<span id="page-??"></span>
275 United Order

As far as we can determine this all-purpose rock
building was one block west and one north from the
Christensen home in South Mayfield. This settle-
ment had a school board of its own by then, which
hired and paid the teachers, The first teachers
were paid so much per pupil, often in produce or
script, since cash was scarce. Later on, three
one-room rock schools were maintained in May-
field with pupils of many ages and grades meeting
together under a single teacher, One of these was
in North Mayfield and two were on the south, where
the younger grades were separated from the older
ones, Long after the Christensens had left that
settlement, the last of the nineteenth century, a
consolidation of schools took place and a new
public school building was planned to house child- _
ren from the beginners to the eighth grade. The
spot selected for the résulting two-story brick
school house was the historic site of Chief Ara-
peen's summer home and a favorite camping
ground for his ancestors in days of long ago.

It must have taken months before word. came
to Else of her father's death. Anders Christian
Christensen died in Norhaa 10 May 1878 and was.
buried in the Parish churchyard there beside his
wife Mette, 15 May 1878, Else's sister Karen
Skaarup later wrote her about it. As Else knew,
her people believed with other Lutherans that if
one died in full belief of the Trinity and had not
denied the faith they would be saved. To her the
gaining of a glorious salvation was not nearly so
easy. She herself had given so much and suffered
so much for the gospel's sake to this point, and:
yet she must have felt much more would yet be
required before she could hope for the best
reward in Heaven. The status of her deceased
parents in the next world must have troubled her,
but the thought of her father's passing must have
brought heartache and memories flooding back to.

twenty and keeping company with a fine young man
by the name of Jens Mikkelsen, Christen and Anne
had another son, born 10 Jan. 1877 whom they
named Joseph, Lars: Myrup and Maren, keeping
pace, had a dainty little daughter born 4 June 1877,
whom they named Karen Laurine. Pauline had

1876.. They had named her Annie Lenora, after
Anne (the American spelling was Annie). The news
in Gunnison that had them all talking, however, was
Lars Myrup's goinginto "polygamy" and taking two
more wives besides Maren, —

Plural marriage was not a general law for
the entire church and was never, at any time,
practiced by over 2 percent of the eligible adult
male population. Those who were permitted to |
practice it officially were chosen for their unques-
tionable integrity and good standing, and undoubtedly
believed plural marriage to be a doctrine of divine
origin. The majority of men and women who
embraced it were among the most moral people
the world has ever known, Through this social
order the great surplus of female Saints in the
church were given protection and absorbed into
useful family life. That some of the finest people
of the church and of the world came from such
plural households is an undeniable fact. But
despite all the social reasons that may be advanced
in its favor, it must be admitted that it was directly
contrary to the tradition of the people, both in and
out of the church,

Perhaps no doctrine of the early church so
caused dissention within or without the organization
as did this so-called "polygamy". | It is a fact, sad
to say, that a number within the church abused this
law. From them and ever-malicious Mormon-
haters, rumors flew on the tongue of gossip and
were multiplied and enlarged, causing abuse, _
ridicule and slander of the church and its people
to such an extent and created such a stir among
its enemies and the press, that the United States
Congress was inveigled into passing a number of
“anti-bigamy'" laws, one after the other, the last
<span id="page-??"></span>
277 United Order

and most infamous being the ''Edmund Tucker Act,"
With these laws the bitter anti-Mormons not only
intended to crush the practice of polygamy but
crush the church as well, How near they came to
succeeding can only be touched on here. For some
thirty years the bitter campaign of persecutions
raged against the church and its people. At its
height Utah, besides being denied statehood, was
actually deprived of the rights of self-government.
The property of the church was confiscated and it
was even taxed outrageously for the use of its
offices, buildings and temple block. During this
period the church was under heavy financial stress
and its credit so depleted it could not borrow a
dollar. Only the faithful payment of tithes enabled
it to weather the storm,

Members of the church for a time were not
allowed to vote or hold office. Federal officers
were sent to govern the Territory; many if not
most of them anti-Mormons who put every
stumbling block they could in the way of the
General Authorities and other church leaders who
practiced plural marriage, Most of these were
hunted down unmercifully, fined, imprisoned, or
both, or forced into exile, Some took their fam-
ilies and fled to Canada or Mexico, but most
stayed and faced the music, Hundreds of homes
were broken up, husbands and fathers sent to the
penitentiary and even wives and mothers jailed
for "contempt of court''’, The Prophet Brigham |
Young, who had many wives, was punished with
the rest and had his health weakened and his life
shortened due to the rigid treatment he was put.
under at that time. His successor in the church,
President John Taylor, died in exile. It was not
until his successor, President Wilford Woodruff,
under divine inspiration, issued his famous
'mmanifesto'' declaring an end to plural marriage
in this dispensation that the persecutions began
to subside, It was a number of years after that,
however, before there was peace again and church
and personal property in the Territory was re-
stored to its rightful owners,

In this atmosphere our Danish progenitors
lived and breathed, for though they themselves
<span id="page-??"></span>

never embraced polygamy (one wife at a time was
enough for Christen and Laurs. Christensen), yet
many of their General, Stake and Ward leaders
and their friends and associates did, For them
they were concerned, Among these of course
were Bishop Ole C. Olsen of Mayfield and their
highly esteemed kinsman, Lars Myrup. Just how
these and other of the polygamist brethren in
Gunnison handled their particular problems in
this regard, we know little. They and their
families were undoubtedly 'made to pay" in some
way or another, since the wary federal authorities
were like bloodhounds - fierce on the trail and
never at rest when on the scent of an offender!
Unexpected knocks on doors of polygamist homes
during those trying times must have struck fear
to the hearts of occupants, young and old.
Searches, raids, arrests, trials and disfran-
chisements were numerous and grievous to bear.
There was usually a hidden trapdoor to a cellar
or attic through which the head ofa household
could be hustled at such times as it was breath-
lessly announced, -- 'U. S, Deputy Marshals are
in town!"

Aside from their run-ins with the law, these
families often had internal problems because of
this plurality of wives, Lois Myrup Anderson, a
granddaughter of Lars and Maren, has given us a
"peek" into the Lars C. N, Myrup home during
this period:-- 'Maren agreed to his second mar-
riage to Josephine Marie Jensen, a very young
Danish immigrant girl, My father (Niels Christian
Myrup) remembered seeing this girl for the first
time one evening when he and the other boys were
in bed. She came into their home and threw her-
self down on the floor in front of Maren and begged
to be allowed to come and live with them. She
was not quite sixteen years old at the time and
hand't been in this country very long, Father said
her family was very poor, Lars used to visit these
new Danish immigrant families to help them get
settled in this country, and Maren often went with
him. (They had doubtless met Danish Marie on
one of these visits.) Later Lars married this
girl (17 Jan, 1876). It was not generally known
that she and Lars were married for she worked

for Maren as a sort of a mother's helper, She
adored Maren and the feeling was mutual between
them, When Maren died suddenly, Marie also died
a few months later, people said 'of a broken heart',
Lars married his third wife, another Danish girl
named Mary Ann Jensen, in St. George, 15 Feb.
1877. When she moved in, the kind and gentle
Maren was very much grieved when her young boys
had to give up their bedroom and sleep in the gran-
ary. Many times the wife Mary Ann put on men's
pants and went out to work in the fields if Lars

was short-handed, Father said that after Maren's
death your grandmother, Else Christensen, came
to their house many times to see how Maren's
children were getting along with their 'hot-
tempered’ stepmother,'"'

6. THE BROWN KIT

The lack of resident doctor's services was
sorely felt at times. Fear and compassion were
mingled when epidemics of contagion spread from
home to home, and feelings of helplessness were
present when new babies were coming, The health
of their families was one of the major concerns of
most pioneer mothers, In rural areas like Gunni-
son Valley, folks had to depend upon old and simple
home made remedies and the blessings of the
Elders of the church to carry them through trials
of sickness, Senna tea was used as a laxative,
sagebrush tea or sulphur-and-molasses made a
good spring tonic. Often a few herbs administered
-with faith brought about wonderful results, From
fall until spring it was the custom for most child-
ren to wear an asafetida.bag apiece, tied ona
string around their necks, to prevent them from >
catching diseases or colds, Even midwives were
scarce and somewhat poorly trained at best. In
Mayfield, Else K, Christensen, Sena Larson,
Margaret Voorhees Whitlock and Anna Carlson
were the ladies credited as having assisted greatly
in the care of the sick during the latter 1870's.
Many hours were spent by them nursing back to
health men, women and children.

There had been sickness in the Laurs M. C.,
<span id="page-??"></span>
United Order 280

Christensen home, the latest being the illness of
the oldest son Christian, or Chris as he was called.
Somehow he had contracted a most serious eye
infection which had progressed to the point that the
sight of the right eye at least was despaired of. In
all the region there was not a doctor or nurse to
whom they could turn for help. Else poulticed,
salved and prayed. -Laurs did what he could, and
the Elders were called in to assist him in adminis-
tering to the afflicted youngster. His grandfather
Christen was:sent for and traveled back and forth
from-Gunnison to advise and help, having had
excellent success in curing ailing animals from
time to time. The struggle. seemed long and at
times most discouraging, but with the kind bless-
ings of the Lord, together with all the special care
and treatment his loved ones could give him, young
Chris grew back to health and strength again and
his sight was preserved, . The infection neverthe-
less had damaged the tear duct of his right eye,
thus allowing an occasional tear to fall on his
cheek regardless of whether he was glad or sad.
This "falling of tears'' continued throughout the
lifetime of this pleasant-natured fellow, His
.family called them "happy tears",

This experience brought more forcefully to
Else's mind something she had been thinking about
for quite awhile, Why couldn't she herself be
trained in the médical skills? The urge to act in
that direction had come to her from time to time
as she worked with the sick, but now the necessity
_of it almost overwhelmed her. In vain she had
‘tried to force the thoughts of such a possibility ©
from her mind, The promptings of the ''still small
voice'' became so strong, however, that she could
ignore them no longer. Laurs also realized the
great responsibility of trying to raise a family with
so little knowledge of diseases, etc., and no avail-
able doctors. He agreed that she should be given
the opportunity to seek medical training, but how?

There were so many drawbacks! Else's
family needed her. Small Emma was not yet two
and little Elsie, with a mind of her own, was
scarcely four. Laurs had his hands full making
ends meet without having the full care of two little

girls and four active boys besides, Then there
was the problem of money -- of this they had little
and none at all to spare for the various expenses
that would have to be met if she went away to study,
even for a short period. But Else was a woman of
unusual faith. She had made difficult moves and >
decisions before in her life and she knew that if
this course was important to their future the way
would be opened for her to accomplish it. She
sought help in prayer.

Then word came of the tragedy that had
struck the Myrups in Gunnison, Again we quote
from the rememberings of Lois M, Anderson:--
"My father was 9 years old. He had been told to
watch his baby sister, Karen Laurine, who was
less than two years old, (Her cousin Emma's
age.) Like most little boys he got interested in
something else and forgot the little sister and she
fell into a cistern or barrel of water and was
drowned,"' (Niels Christian Myrup grieved about
this the rest of his life and never got over feeling
that he was responsible.) Maren was well along
with her sixth child at the time and this was hard
on her indeed, That Laurs and Else drove to
Gunnison to offer aid and comfort can well be
imagined, for this was a close-knit family. And
that Else at the time had grave misgivings at the
thoughts of leaving her own baby Emma and her
other children, can also be readily believed, Her
dreams must have been troubled as she went on
with her planning and preparation to leave her
family for awhile. She wished before leaving,
however, to see Maren safely through her delivery.

On 10 May 1879, just two months following
the sad death of her baby girl, Maren gave birth >
to her fourth son, Joseph Henry Myrup. The very
next day Else left home to take the train to Salt
Lake City, where medical training was available.
Laurs drove her in the wagon to the railroad
terminal at York, just over the Sanpete County
line into Juab. Here she took the train headed
for Salt Lake City. She had borrowed money for
her ticket and a little extra from a friend, She
had arranged also for a Sister Anderson to look
after things at home in her absence. No doubt
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 282

this lady had been duly cautioned to "keep the little
ones from the water!'' The children must have
been a handfull for Sister Anderson at best. In
Elsie C, Bartholomew's history she tells something
of her reaction at being left at home:-- ''At the age
of four I became tired of home life, mother having
gone to Salt Lake City to study how to take care of
the sick. Sister Anderson, who was caring for the
family in mother's absence, did not please me; so

I took my belongings and went through our garden

to the next lot where the Mortensons lived, They
were grandma and grandpa to me, When I got there
I had lost one of my hand knit stockings, I retraced
my steps back to our garden and there it was, hang-
ing on a gooseberry bush,"

Else K. Christensen must have had a great
deal of confidence in her own capacity, or a great
deal of determination, or both. Though she had
made no prearrangements and had arrived at the
railroad station in Salt Lake City that llth of May
1879, practically a stranger, she seemed to know
exactly where she was going. Whether it was shown
her in a dream (as some have said) or had come to
her through inquiry or in some other manner, we
cannot say. Truly she was gifted with dreams and
great spiritual insight - who are we to say how she
knew her way then? Be that as it may, she went
directly to the home of an aged woman doctor of
medicine originally from Denmark, knocked on
the door, introduced herself, stated her mission
and, after only a moments hesitation, was admitted
by the elderly doctor herself, for she lived alone.
Else was without sufficient money for board and
room for any length of time at all, let alone any to
pay for medical instruction; yet here she was in
the home of this talented lady asking for these
very services,

Nicolene Olsen, Doctress and Midwife, was
suffering from an ailment of long-standing and had
discontinued her practice years before. She had
taken female students into her home from time to
time since then however, to train them in the art
of children's diseases, obstetrics and general
medicine, in which she had specialized, This she
now had also ceased to do, vowing to teach no more
<span id="page-??"></span>
283 Brown Kit

and turning a number away who had sought her
assistance, But there was something about Else
K. Christensen that so impressed her that she
could not say her nay (nej), Somehow the favored
Else came to an agreement with Sister Olsen and
it is quite probable that she was allowed to work
for the aged woman in return for her lodgings and
training. On the flyleaf of a medium sized hard
backed journal the next day, Else wrote, with
scratch pen and purple ink, the following in
Danish (translated):--''Beginning the 12 May with
my understudying from Sister N, Olsen. Salt Lake
City 1879,"'

Else stayed at the home of Mrs, Olsen, who
spent practically all of her available time for the
next month training this eager and capable woman
in medical skills. They had no language problem,
as each was well versed in Danish, nor were there
any personality or other problems to stand in the
way of learning. Else had remarkable power to
grasp and remember the things she heard; thus
she gained rapidly a comprehensive knowledge of
obstetrics and the general practice of medicine.
Furthermore, Sister Olsen gave her a number of
her medical books and dictated various methods
and treatments, remedy recipes and directions
which Else copied neatly into her journal in Danish.
Her training also included some practical exper-
ience, for she delivered at least one child in the |
process, This item was written in hér journal: --
"Br, Smith, S, L. C. en datter den 9 June 1879,"!
(From then on for the next fourteen years she
recorded the father's name, and sex and date of.
birth of hundreds of other babies’she ushered into
the world. )

When the generous Danish lady had taught.
her student all she herself had learned in her
medical studies in Copenhagen, besides much she
had acquired throughout years of. practice, the
period of intensive training was ended and Else
was ready to return home to her husband and
children, as well as to begin her new career,

But first she purchased some tools-of-the-trade
as it were, which included, among other smaller
items, a blood-letting knife, Likely some whiskey
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 284

(she wrote it 'Hvisky'') was also included since
this was called for in various of the treatments
she had studied. She also purchased a middle-
sized brown satchel or kit, in which to carry her
professional equipment, Upon her leaving, the
gracious teacher bid her a tearful farewell, for
they had grown to be staunch friends, and gave her
the following letter of recommendation (translated
from the Danish):-- "Salt Lake City, June 14, 1879 -
It is Sister Christensen's wish to live to be an
excellent midwife and to bring help and happiness
to suffering humanity so that she may be an honor
to God and a blessing to his people. I myself felt
that I didn't want to give any more instruction in
this work, because of my weakness and long lasting
ailment I have had to fight, But when Sister |
Christensen stepped to my door there was an
unexplainable spirit that attended her and it was
impossible for me to refuse her. As I became
acquainted with her I realized that she was a most
worthy person, and she has proved in every way to
be superior to anyone I have ever trained in my
home in this work - this dear, unforgettable
daughter of God. And because of this, with
willingness and in all sincerity, I give her the
very best recommendation to anyone who under
any condition may need the sincere help of Sister
Christensen, She will attend them and care for
and protect them as a mother of Israel, with love
and wisdom and with sympathy and patience. This
is my full conviction. Wherefore I am satisfied to
leave her in the hands of God, and anyone who
needs her help, with my very best recommendation,
And may the Lord of Israel bless her entrance into
and exit from every home is my prayer, in Jesus'
name - Amen. Nicolene Olsen, Midwife and
Doctress,'!

When Else returned to Mayfield she was at
once called into service. The nearest regular
doctors were at Manti and Ephraim and so her
help was greatly needed, not only in her own town
but in all of South Sanpete, She had only been home
a day or two when she was called to deliver a new
baby, recorded thus in her medical journal:--
<span id="page-??"></span>
285 Brown Kit

"Lars Greekkersen (prob. Gregersen) en datter
den 17 June 1879." It wasn't long before her
ability became known in the towns neighboring on
Mayfield, from Salina on the south to Pettyville
(Sterling) on the north. Else made her work one
of mercy and love. With her brown kit in one hand
and a bowl of Danish soup in the other, she went
forth serving the sick and the needy. Members of
her family soon became accustomed to the sound
of heavy wagons rattling up the street and stopping
at their place any time of night or day. Then Else
would be off on her missions of mercy, for she
was usually prepared to leave at almost a-moments
notice.

Whether she assisted at the birth of Christen
and Anne's last child and fifth son, George Ludvig
Christensen, 20 Aug. 1879, was not recorded in
her journal, (This child only lived one-and-a-half
years, passing away 11 Feb. 1881), But surely
Else must have been summoned to the same home
and the bedside of Christen and Karen's twenty
year old daughter Petrine, some two weeks later.
We have no details of the cause of Petrine's death,
only that she succumbed 8 Sept. 1879 in Gunnison.
This lovely girl was engaged to be married at the
time to Jens Mikkelsen (later of Manti). Her loss
must have been a cause of much sorrow to her
loved ones and friends. Death is sad at any time
but when one is in the full bloom of youth with so
many plans and hopes for the future, it can seem
sadder, (She was not soon forgotten by Jens
Mikkelsen, for 26 Mar. 1903 he and his wife then
went to the Manti temple where he was sealed to
Petrine Christensen for eternity, and his wife _
stood for her.} Caskets of wood for the deceased
were made locally then by one James Hansen of
Centerfield, In those days they were covered
with a black material and it was not until about
1886 that white covered coffins were first used
in the area,

But there were happy times too, especially
for the children. Christmastime was always cele-
brated with much gaiety in the Christensen house-
hold, with the traditional Danish ways of holding
Yule mingled with pioneer customs, Christmas
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 286

Eve was the important family gathering time when
one and all mingled their voices in laughter and
song and, holding hands, danced around the candle
lighted Christmas tree. Then the ''Yule Missen",
"Christmas Elves", 'Santa's Brownies'', or what-
ever they chanced to call them then, would be
expected and the children would be rushed off to
bed after hanging up their stockings and putting

out a dish of rice mush or pudding on the doorstep
to feed the night visitors. (This Christmas Eve
family evening became so firmly established in the
L.M.C. Christensen home that it has endured
among some of his descendants for three genera-
tions.) Presents for the children's Christmas would
be mostly homemade things: perhaps marbles made
from clay, berry stained red-cheeked rag dolls,
dolls carved from wood with hair of black sheep's
wool or modest corncob dolls; molasses or honey
candy and pinenuts and pine and spruce gum
gathered from the mountains, Ifa feast could not
be spread at any other time of the year, Else would
at least manage one for Christmas Day - stuffed
goose, pork or sausage, sweet soup made with sego,
dried currants, prunes and cinnamon-stick, coffee
cake and a kettle of fragrant Danish soup steaming
around plump islands of Danish dumplings for
accompaniment. The last day of each year was the
traditional time for a community party for the
children there, On New Year's Eve in Mayfield,
that year of 1879, ''the meeting house, bedecked
with evergreen banners and rosettes, was turned
into a fairy bower, Santa Claus, standing between
two giant Christmas trees illuminated with scores
of candles, gave a welcome to all. Each of the 120
children present drew prizes from the trees,'' Itis
quite certain that at least the five older children of
Laurs and Else Christensen were among those
there to draw prizes as well as to enjoy the excite-
ment of the festivities.

In spite of the unprecedented cold weather in
the spring and early summer of 1879, when sugar
cane froze three times in June and the maize twice
in July, the crops had been about normal, The
acorn crop in the mountains, however, had been
particularly abundant, which, according to Indian
legend, foretold a hard winter ahead. Two
<span id="page-??"></span>
287 Brown Kit

venturesome gentlemen decided to profit by this
acorn crop and thus turned a large number of
hungry hogs loose in Twelve Mile Canyon to feed
on them. But the two ''gentlemen" quarreled and
the project was apparently abandoned. By the late
fall the pigs refused to live on the acorns any
longer and came out of the mountains and down
into the fields around Mayfield by the hundreds,
Some of them were penned by the people, as no
one seemed to own them. Laurs and his boys cap-
tured a couple of the roaming hogs, as others were
doing, and penned them up in their back yard. It
seems none were prepared for the exceptionally
severe winter that followed. Snow fell to an
abnormal depth early in the season, piled up high
during the winter, and kept up so late in the spring
of 1880 that animals of all kinds could not find any-
thing to eat in the fields or on the range,

In his recollections Albert tells of the tragedy
that was suffered by the Laurs Christensen family
at that time:-- ''Soon all of the feed at home was
gone and our animals were kept alive only by eating
the straw from the straw sheds, Father had a yoke
of oxen, 'Tom!'" and ''Jim'', one old milch cow,
"Bluebell" and a heifer "Lillie", that would calve
in the spring or summer. These were the hope
and pride of the family. With careful feeding,
father managed to winter his oxen, cow and heifer,
The hogs were butchered. As soon as vegetation
commenced to grow in the spring, he turned our
oxen and the young heifer out to forage on the foot-
hills east of Mayfield with the hope that they could
get food sufficient to survive. We kept track of
them and at first they seemed to be doing well.

"One day, however, my brother Joseph and
I were hiking about in those east hills barefoot. ©
We first found Lillie in a hollow, dead, She was
swelled up with her legs sticking up in the air.
Then we went in search of Tom and Jim. We
found Tom all right up on a side hill south of |
whe re we had located Lillie's body. We found
Jim further up on the hill; his back was downhill,
his legs were in the air - he was dead. Doubtless
the two had eaten poison weeds, Now we just had
the old cow Bluebell, who was dry, and the ox Tom.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 288

This was indeed bad news for the family."' These
crushing losses. during such hard times made a
vivid impression on seven-and-a-half year old
Albert at the time.

For Laurs himself this catastrophe, coupled
with the hardships and emotional strain of the past
few years plus the economic uncertainty and anxiety
of the present, seemed like a last straw. He be-
came despondent and discouraged and his health
and courage began to break, In this unhappy con-
‘dition he seemed, at least momentarily, to have
blamed the Bishop and even the Church itself for |
this misfortune; having, in a quandary to know what
to do with his starving animals that desperate spring,
asked the advice of the Bishop and taken it. Echoing
far off down the musty corridors of time we hear
the words of a somewhat tense domestic drama,
similar to one which reportedly took place in May-
field that spring of 1880... The despairing voice
of Laurs:-- "Let's give it all up and go back to
Denmark where we belong! I'm sick and tired of
the never-ending struggle of it all. Ever since we
left the Old Country we have had little else but
grief, worry, toil and failure!''. . . Then the
answering voice of the oft outspoken Else, weary
with the burden of her tenth child, yet unborn:--

"T gave up my family, home, friends, all that I
then held dear for the sake of the Gospel. I risked
my life with you on the angry sea; I walked by your
side over vast plains and rugged mountains, in the
scorch of sun -- the beat of wind and rain - the
chill of snow; I held my ears to shut out the shrieks
of murdering Indians and pounding of drums, as I
bore your first sons; I have feared for my life and
at times gone hungry; I have slaved and toiled with
you, and born your many children - Ihave buried
one of our own flesh and blood, Now if you think I
am going to 'give it all up', as you suggest, and
take our sons and daughters far away from the
influence and strength and blessings of Zion to
raise, because of an old dead cow, you are not

the man I thought you to be! You may go - but

you will go alone", . . and that ended it.

Discouragement can weaken body and mind
and cause even the spirit to falter at times. Laurs
<span id="page-??"></span>
289 Brown Kit

too was a thoroughbred in every sense of the word.
He also had given up much for the Gospel and
almost everything for his wife and children. He
had not only done his own work, trying to build

and provide for his family, but had of course

taken a great deal of the responsibility of the

home while Else had been in training, and con-
tinued to do so while she was acting as nurse

and doctor. While he could not do the heavy house-
work, he did more than his share in caring for the
children, He had provided them with a fairly com-
fortable three- roomed adobe house there in South
Mayfield, with a log granary, cow sheds, pigpen,
chicken coup, outhouse and other needed additions
in back, (These were well built for most of them
are still standing.) He was faithful to the Church
and his Priesthood, honest in his dealings with
man and God, a kind, helpful and devoted husband
and a wonderfully patient, understanding and loving
father. Hard-working as his strength would allow,
he was also dependable as the coming of night after
day. He seldom complained and cast off most of
his troubles with a shrug of his shoulders and a
witty remark,

Can one think of Grandma Else without
Grandpa Laurs? Nej, nej, for they belonged
together, The thorns and thistles in our paths of
life may retard our progress briefly. It is no dis-
grace to stumble o'er them, The important thing
is that we rise again and go forward, even though
' bruised and torn, fighting our way along, Itis |
not what one has to contend with along the way of
life but what one is able to endure and overcome
that signals success,

Laurs squared his shoulders again, yoked
Tom up with the neighbor's ox, put his -hand to the
plough and went forward with his farm work, Then
Else gave birth to their tenth child, Lars Peter
Christensen (later changed to Louis D.) Saturday
20 Mar, 1880, there in their home in Mayfield,
According to the record in her journal she took
care of the delivery herself, though she likely
leaned heavily on her husband for help at the time.
This, their fifth son, must have been a good sized
baby for he grew to be the largest of their children,
<span id="page-??"></span>

They had this infant named and blessed at the
church 3rd June by Bishop Ole C, Olsen. He was
a fair child with curly blonde hair, a mischievous
smile and a powerful pair of lungs. It soon became
apparent that he would make his voice heard in the
world,

Else's work with the sick now took her to all
parts of Gunnison Valley. If it was as a midwife
she went her fee not only included delivering the
baby but taking care of it and the mother as well,
during her confinement or "lying in" period, which
lasted on the average of two weeks, She also did
some of the housework and the washing for her
patients, She was often paid in other than money;
for example:-- (From her journal) 'Mrs, King
came and paid. . . peaches .60, butter . 60,
wheat $1.60, hat .25 = $3,05 - owe $11. 80;
Frandsen came the 6 Jan. . . wood $2.00, 2 dolly
$2.00 - paid $15, . etc.'' But whether she was
paid in cash or produce her earnings must have
helped a great deal to give a lift to the sagging
economy of the hard-pressed family, proving to
be a blessing.

An increasing number of Else's patients
were now coming from the town of Gunnison, which
was more central and held by far the larger part of
the valley's population. It was decided that it would
be much more convenient for the family if they
would pick up and leave Mayfield and move back to
Gunnison, Else could look in on her loved ones
more often while working there and educational
opportunities for the children would be better also,
So Laurs found a buyer for his home and small
farm, one Lars P, Jensen from Pleasant Grove,
Utah County. As a down payment Brother Jensen
gave Laurs a wagon and team of horses, we are
not aware of what else, It appears that the deal
was made sometime around the fore part of July
1880, but the property was not completely paid for
until 10 Apr. 1906, at which date it was deeded by
Laurs to the other party.

Their brother-in-law, Lars Myrup, made
one of his two homes in Gunnison available to them
and their brood of seven that early summer, As
far as we can ascertain this small adobe house was
<span id="page-??"></span>
291 Brown Kit

in the eastern part of town about a half mile west
of where Christen, Anne and their family were
settled, It appears that Myrup's other Gunnison
home was in the southern part of town just east
of the main street which led south to "the Field"
or South Gunnison; for here, it has been said, he
owned about a city block of land. He also owned
an extensive farm near the sugar factory in those
south fields and was building a new home in that
area, Though a number of families were already
living on their farms there, inthe early 1880s
settlers moved out into South Gunnison in great
numbers, including the families of Laurs Myrup
and Andrew and Pauline Andersen, Many new
homes were built, some of adobe, some of logs.

Soon after moving back to Gunnison, Laurs
Christensen leased a farm in Christenburg, about
three or four miles from where they then lived,
from a large landowner and stockraiser by the
name of Julius H. Christensen (no relation), Mr.
Christensen and his two brothers, Theodore and
Titus, owned a great deal of the land in that desir-
able location midway between Gunnison and May-
field, In fact, they had been the first to take up
land and move their families there, and it was
after them that this sprawling, scattered farming
area of Christenburg had been named. The early
spring of the next year (1881) Laurs and Else and
their children moved from the Myrup home in East
Gunnison to a rented house in North Christenburg,
known as Antelope Valley, to be nearer their
leased farm, The earliest homes there were
three-room ranch type dwellings with walls of
adobe. ''Wild flowers and grass, seeded by the
wind and watered by the rain, covered the thick
sod on each roof in their time and season,'' Here
to this choice farming land lying east and north
of Chalk Hill and bordering the Sanpitch River,
Laurs brought his family 1 to live for the next three
or four summers,

In the meantime he purchased an acre of .
ground in the northwest part of Gunnison on which
stood a small adobe house with two rooms, facing
south and standing back a considerable distance
from the street. In this his family lived during
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 292

the winters, Soon a larger house was erected
just south and west of the old one and both places
were used to house the large Christensen family
in winters for a year or so until the new house
could be completed. This house was built mostly
of.rock hauled from the quarry north of Gunnison
cemetery. Eventually the new house boasted three
good sized rooms besides a kitchen and pantry on
the ground floor plus one large unfinished and two
small finished rooms in the attic upstairs, used
for sleeping, .Whether the new rock house was
sufficiently completed in time to welcome Laurs'
and Else's second pair of twins is not known, but
that they were born in one or the other of those
two houses on the corner of first north and second
west in Gunnison is a certainty,

These second twins, a boy anda girl, were
born at 4 o'clock in the morning, Wed, 19 July:
1882, and according to Else's journal.she had no~
attending midwife other than herself, The little
ones were feeble however, and help was sent for
to give them names and blessings, Grandfather
Christen Christensen came and blessed the first
child,. a boy, giving him the name Arthur Marinus
Christensen, Brother John Wasden, a neighbor
from across the street, gave the little girl a bless-
ing and the name Martine Lauriette, the second
name for Laurs, but she died about 12 noon that
same day. And so another little spirit went to join
her sister and others of her departed kin in Para-
dise. The boy Arthur lived and, under the tender
and expert care of his fond mother, grew in health
and strength and wisdom. It was not until Feb. l,
1883, however, that they took him to church for
his official christening,

It is a great thing to deliver ones own twin
babies; but when we consider that Else delivered
at least twenty-six babies in 1882, one of them a
daughter for Hans Jensen just six days before her
twins came, another a daughter for Lars Myrup
nineteen days after, the picture becomes far more
involved, and we are led to feel nothing but amaze-
ment at the accomplishments of this remarkable
woman. We are not forgetting for a moment either
that when possible she did much of the housework
<span id="page-??"></span>
293 Brown Kit

and took care of the mothers and babies she
brought, until the mothers were up and around
again. Of course she had the help of her family,
as well as a hired girl in the home much of the
time, but nevertheless she was simply marvelous
during those crowded years of her medical service.
Her brown kit was always ready, standing by the
side of her bedroom door, and there were many
sick that she attended, aside from her duties as
midwife, for folks came to her from all.over the
valley and she answered their calls willingly and
promptly. It will always be a mystery how Else

K. continued her work of love and mercy for others
without neglecting her own family, but the health
and education of her children was one of her chief
concerns and was always taken care of in the best
possible manner. She was also concerned with the
health of her husband and tried to keep him in top
physical condition. We have been told that one of
the methods she used on Laurs for this purpose
was to thin his blood every spring with her blood-
letting knife. As a spring tonic for her children,
however, she used the less severe treatment of
sulphur and molasses or a big dose of epsom salts,

When Maren Myrup's seventh child was born,
10 May 1881, Else was at the delivery bed of her
beloved sister-in-law. Little Sarahann Myrup,
however, only lived about sixteen months and then
passed away (Sept. 1882), It was about this time
that an incident happened involving Maren and her
second son Niels, and told as follows by Lois M,
Anderson:-- 'My father told me one. story that I
shall always remember, When he was about ten
years old he was sent to help his grandfather, ©
Christen Christensen, doing odd jobs around the
yard, One morning when he arrived his grandpa:
accused him of taking some of his tools. Father.
denied this but his grandpa apparently didn't believe
him and gave him a good 'cuffing' to force him to
tell the truth. When young Niels got away he ran
home and told his mother, the lovely, ladylike
little Maren, who promptly ordered the boys to...
hitch up the buggy and taking her son Niels along-
side on the seat, and with the buggy whip in her.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 294

hand, set out to confront her father, Niels said
later that sitting there looking at his irate little
mother with the whip in her hand, he began to fear
for his grandfather. Maren was convinced that her
son was telling the truth. When they arrived at her
father's place, Christen apologized to them both.

I cannot remember whether the tools were found

or not but I don't suppose Maren sent her young
son to work for his grandfather again, at least not
that year, I think our great-grandfather Christen-
sen was a rather stern man, at any rate for our
day.''

Nearly nine months following the death of
Maren's little Sarahann, Else was called into ©
deliver another baby for her. Manda May Myrup,
born in Gunnison 24 May 1883, was Maren's eighth
and last child, for this young thirty-four-and-a-
half year old mother was not permitted to watch
over the lives of her children in mortality much
longer. When tiny Manda lacked eleven days of
being two months old, Maren died very suddenly
(13 July 1883) of what was later believed to be
appendicitis, although it was not known by that
name then, Lars Myrup's second wife, Marie,
took little Manda to care for but the small child
only outlived her mother less than a month, dying
in August that same year. Thus the plucky little
Danish emigrant pioneer and mother, Maren, came
to her life's end and her body rested at length be-
side those of her three infant daughters in the
Gunnison cemetery. Her oldest daughter Mary and
four sons, Lars or Lewis C., Niels C., Adolph M.,
and Joseph Henry survived her and lived to marry
and bring a sizable posterity into the world to honor
the memory of Maren Christensen Myrup.

Else K, felt concern for her sister-in-law's
children and after their mother's death looked in
on them often to see how they were getting along
with their 'hot-tempered stepmother', Maren's
boys were’ still sleeping in the granary at the
Myrup place when they all took measles and had
them very bad. Else went out time and again to
help doctor them, They all thought a great deal
of their Aunt Else, A little later on the son Niels
developed the nervous disorder, St. Vitus' Dance,
<span id="page-??"></span>
295 Brown Kit

and Else again traveled back and forth to Center-
field to doctor him, She gave him some nerve
medicine which helped him sleep at nights, The
treatments must have been effective for the malady
didn't stay long with him.

Those summers in the early 1880s when the
Laurs Christensen family moved out into Antelope
Valley (North Christenburg) must have been looked
forward to especially by the children, Though the
older ones helped their father on the farm there or
herded sheep or cattle, there was always time to
roam barefoot through the meadows, play hide-
and-go-seek, pomp-pomp-pull-away or such with
the children of Ole and Inger Larsen, who lived
neighbors, or go swimming with them in the ''Big
Hole", a bend in the Sanpitch River back of the
Larsen's barn, It was while swimming here in
the Big Hole that little Elizabeth Larsen, about
four years old, had been drowned, They found
her small body one mile down stream,

Else K, was of course still going out from
here on her missions of mercy. One of the older
Larsen children, Caroline, remembered that one
evening when Sister Christensen had just returned
from one of her longer periods of doctoring, her
son Albert ran out to greet her with these words,
"Mother we are having clabber milk and lettuce
for supper !'' Perhaps Caroline thought this a very
strange meal, but no doubt young Albert knew how

“much his mother enjoyed clabber-milk. In her
memoirs Caroline Larsen recalled other things
about the Christensens. She remembered Albert
as being a very spiritual child; for sometimes,
‘when the children were all playing there together,
Albert would come up missing, When they hunted
they would often find him in some thick bushes or
trees - praying. So then they would all tiptoe
away very quietly and wait, never saying a word
to him about it afterwards, Though Caroline was
nearer Joseph's and Albert's age she was drawn
to their eldest brother Christian, Later there in
Christenburg she and Christian became childhood
sweethearts,

Not far north from the Christensen and Larsen
homes there was a sheep-shearing corral, which
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 296

had been maintained from the early years of
Christenburg's settlement, As many as 40, 000
head of sheep on their way from the desert to the
summer range were sheared there annually by
experts, some of them from Antelope Valley. We
have been told that Else K. Christensen sheared
many sheep at this corral in those early days and
that she could outshear many of the men. When
the sheep came in for shearing in the early spring,
small hills of wool-filled sacks would pile up at
the corral. It was great sport for the children who
lived nearby, and others who came in with owners
of the herds, to clamber up and jump down or chase
each other back and forth over and around these
huge piles of filled wool-sacks, Sometimes whole
families would come induring sheep shearing time
and make a days picnic of it, This shearing corral
was kept up well into the twentieth century. The
Larsen and Christensen children enjoyed this fun
year after year in those early Christenburg days,
as some of their children and even their grand-
children did after them,

At one time in Christenburg a heart-rending
experience happened in the Christensen household.
One cool evening, perhaps in early spring or late
fall, a hot log fire was ablaze in the fireplace of
their dwelling, to warm things, Young Louis,
about four years old, had been snuggled into one
of his father's old coats and was standing near the
open fire to make doubly sure of getting warmed up.
The coat almost dragged the floor and its sleeves
hung well down over his chubby hands, In an
unguarded moment the small boy reached out his
arms towards the dancing flames and at that instant
the right sleeve of the coat caught fire and before
the pain-stricken, screaming child could be given
the necessary help by his distracted parents, the
four finge rs of his right hand were so terribly
burned, down to the very knuckles, that they could
not be saved. All of his mother's medical powers
and the spiritual strength of the entire family was
brought to bear in an effort to heal the seared flesh
of suffering little ''Lou'"", Proud flesh set in and it
was with much difficulty that Else was able to save
the hand proper, She often told of how she worked,
wept, and prayed to save that hand! Nobs grew on
<span id="page-??"></span>

the stumps but the fingers never grew in again,
but with the help of the Lord the main part of the
hand was preserved and became useful again; for
Louis learned to use this maimed hand with great
dexterity in the years that followed.

It was there in Christenburg, 10 July 1884,
that a church Patriarch by the name of K. H,
Brown, along with his Danish scribe Antone C.
Sorensen, came to the Christensen home by appoint-
ment to give blessings of counsel and encourage-
ment to various members of the family. Laurs
and Else had blessings at that time, as well as
Albert, Elsie and even little Louis, and perhaps
mo st of the other family members who were at
home at the time. Since the mother Else's bless-
ing had so much influence on her later life, as
perhaps was true of the others also, we wish to
quote parts of it here:-- ". . . If you will listen to
your husband's advice and to the voice of the 'still
small spirit' the Lord shall give you holy visions
by day and holy dreams at night, clothe you with
power from on high so that you shall have wisdom
to manage your house, be a comfort and support
to your husband, and a good mother to your child-
ren, . , You shall be known of the Lord and your
seed shall be blessed by him. . . You shall have
wisdom to do much good among your brothers and
sisters in Zion and the Lord shall bless you with
faith. . . the works of your hands shall be blessed,
Your pantry shall always be full and your children
never lack for the good things of life. . . Your
posterity shall be blessed and shall be a star in
your crown and a comfort in your old age... .
You were chosen to come forth here on the earth
in order to accomplish a great mission, along
with your husband and family, for your father's
and mother's lineage, those who are now dead and
in prison waiting to be freed by you and your
family. . . Because of your obedience to the
Gospel and your faithfulness throughout trials you
shall live to see, while still inthe flesh, your
children and grandchildren receive possessions
in the Stakes of Zion and the Spirit of the Lord
rest upon them,'' It was through this blessing
that summer's day in Christenburg, that the
"Spirit of Elijah" or the seed of genealogy was,

if not planted, at least caused to sprout and grow
in the mind and heart of Else K, Christensen. Her
beloved parents and her ancient kinsmen in an
eternal prison - could it be? Was it her destiny

to free them? Such thoughts may have been
mingled with her thinking as she was seized with

a feeling of the necessity of her searching out the
records of her dead ancestors, and from that day
she began to plan for it.

There were no stores or businesses in
Christenburg, or any 'meeting house!! - just
stretches of farms, orchards and meadows, with
a few farm dwellings and barns, etc., with the
Sanpitch River winding its way between. The
Christensens, Larsens, and the few other families
there, were obliged to travel to Gunnison to attend
religious services, When their elders went along
they usually rode, but otherwise the children
walked back and forth to Sunday schools, Primaries,
and Religion classes, each wearing his or her only
good pair of shoes, thus called Sunday shoes, It
was here in Christenburg that the older Christensen
children learned early in life the value of work,
thrift and industry. Here they learned to appreciate
nature and developed a love for the out-of-doors
and the "good earth", It was here also that the
older boys became acquainted with the man from
whom their father leased his farm, the well-to-do
land owner and sheepman Julius H, Christensen,
and he acquainted with them to the satisfactory
point, at least, that this gentleman came to think
enough of them to hire them to work for him, one
after the other for many years, beginning with the
oldest, Chris,

Laurs Christensen and Ole H. Larsen often
freighted together during this period, and later on
as well. Though the danger from outlaws and
robbers was not then as great as in earlier times
it was still a threat and thus considered safest for
freighters to travel in groups, and so they did,
There was safety in numbers in case of sickness
or injuries, runaways or broken wagons, as well
as highwaymen. It was extremely dangerous to
carry money. Pay for freighted produce was as
a rule sent home by mail. Grain, flour, meat and
<span id="page-??"></span>
299 Brown Kit

poultry, fruit and garden products were hauled to
the mines in Utah and Nevada; anything that would
sell, in fact, was taken there to sell, often for
gold. Many farmers made trips after their crops
had been harvested or at other times when the
farm work could be managed by the women and
children, Taking care of their animals, preparing
food and entertaining each with tales of Indians and
the olden days around the campfire, relieved the
monotony of these long hard trips.

Laurs and Else's eleventh and last child was
born in the new rock house in northwest Gunnison
at nine o'clock on a Sunday night, 27 March 1887.
She was blessed in the home 7 April and given the
name Elevena, after the Danish way of naming;
viz - if the eleventh child happened to be a girl
she was given the name Elevena; if the eighth child
happened to be a boy, he was named Otto, etc.
Later the spelling was simplified to Elvena but
almost from the first she was called ''Vena'"' by
everyone except her mother. Though not men-
tioned in Else's journal, this home naming was
probably done by Elvena's grandfather, Christen
Christensen, since he was usually called for such
a service if available, The child's official bless-
ing and naming at church, however, was not taken
care of for nearly two years and nine months
following her birth, or 23 Dec. 1889, and it was
done then by Gunnison's Bishop Christian August
Madsen,

On Christen Christensen's seventieth birth-
day, 29 July that year of 1887, all of his living
descendants got together and held a celebration
in his honor at his home in east Gunnison, He
turned handsprings to show all present what he
could do at his age; none others there could do
what he did. He had a lively disposition and was
a good mixer, He loved to dance and did very well
at it. But most of all he was a fine storyteller,
and folks always gathered round to hear the tales
he told, especially the young people. He was an
excellent letter writer and a fine penman besides,
He always wrote to his folks in Denmark once a
year, and on these occasions he related to them
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 300

everything of interest that had transpired during
the past year. He had an excellent memory. He
had his wife Anne take notes for him as the year
progressed, and when he was ready to make his
yearly report he would take these notes and go

into a room by himself and write his letter, This
would take him many days - but when the letter was
finished it was worth it. Anne would read it through
aloud and the children always tried to be around to
enjoy the contents before it was mailed off to
Denmark,

Christen Christensen at seventy was still a
very proud man, although the vicissitudes of life
had mellowed him some, He had lost most of what
he had when he left the United Order, and though a
farmer and stockraiser by trade, and a very good
one, he had taken up the job of delivering salt to
the people of the county to get a little ready cash
to help re-establish himself. He got the salt from
the salt bluffs about two miles west of Axtell, This
placer salt-bearing mine embraced about 40 acres
in that locality, In the earliest days of settlement
each family had obtained and refined its own salt,
but later it became quite an object of barter and
many necessities were obtained through this traffic.
The price of rock salt in 1884 was $2.00 per ton,
delivered, but naturally it became more expensive
as people prospered. The many tons of rock salt
hauled to the silver mines in Utah, Idaho and
Nevada were of some consideration to the economy
of the people who dug it out and hauled it. Christen
hauled rock salt at first and he became quite a well-
known figure throughout Gunnison Valley, seated
erect in his little 'salt-cart'' driving through,
stopping at farmhouses and dwellings along his
route to deliver his commodity. Later several
boileries were established in the valley, with
capacities to turn out 400 tons of fine salt yearly,
Lars Myrup had one of these out in Centerfield
where he made and sold table salt. He had several
working for him. They would take a wagon and
drive out to Redmond (west of Axtell) and get the
rock salt, return with it to Centerfield and put it
in a large vat or boiler, filled with boiling water,
where it would be dissolved, When the salt had
all crystalized in the bottom and the dross had
<span id="page-??"></span>
301 Brown Kit

been drained off, the salt crystals were dried out,
ground and sold. It was quite possible that
Christen worked for his son-in-law, Lars Myrup,
selling the refined salt; for he kept up both farm-
ing and delivering salt as long as he was able, Be
that as it may, one's eyes grow moist thinking of
this once proud Danish gentleman whom some had
called 'the great man of the north'', who once
drove his own fine team and carriage as a well-
to-do farmer in Old Denmark, peddling salt in
Zion in an old one-horse cart.

A nice thing happened to this fine old man
about this time. The three Hansen orphans, whom
he had long sought to find, found him! In some
way they had learned that Christen was the one
who had paid their passage, and that of their dead
parents, to Zion more than twenty years before,
They located his whereabouts and came to pay him
back for this noble service. They were some of
the very few who ever reimbursed him for the
financial help he had given them in getting to
America, He never worried about this and often
stated that it was a blessing to use one's means
in such a worthy cause, But this money he did
receive came in handy in his old age. He desired
to show his appreciation, and since these people
had no records of their births in Denmark and
other genealogical data and had longed so much
to have this information, he sent back to the Old
Country and obtained many of these records for
them, for which they were most thankful.

There was so much contagion in the Valley
in those early years. Diphtheria had been ram-
pant in Gunnison in November of 1879, at which —
time six of the brethren had been appointed as a
board of health to guard against the dread disease,
Schools were closed for a time until it was con-.
sidered safe to recommence. Again in 1884 this
same disease had caused the people there ''to be
diligent in the practice of sanitary rules'', Meet-
ings then were not discontinued but it was ''con-
sidered wisdom to leave the children home." In
the fall of the year 1887 an epidemic of diphtheria
swept over the whole of Gunnison Valley. Many
people contracted this highly contagious disease,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Brown Kit 302

Sore feverish throats were swabbed with alcohol
and blue vitriol in an effort to combat the dread
bacillus. Most all homes were visited by death.
Fatality among the children was exceedingly great,
sometimes three or four from a family. Some
adults also fell prey to this fearful malady, In
North Mayfield, during one of these epidemics,
five of the seven children of Simon and Martha
Hansen (she who had been the first teacher in the
United Order there) died of diphtheria within one
week, Three of them were buried in the same
grave, In Gunnison, children of the Ole H. and
Inger Hansen family, who had recently moved
from Christenburg, into a lovely new winter home
there, contracted this ravaging sickness and two
of them, Peter and Hanner, died of it that year.
Mixed feelings of fear and compassion filled the
hearts of the people as diphtheria spread from
home to home. The ref flag of warning on so many
gate posts, all too often became a symbol of death,

Else K, Christensen was on the go during
that dreadful time. History has failed to record
the extent of her efforts, to this point, but merely
noted:-- ''Mrs., Elsie (Else) Christensen is said
to have had 'great success' and Parlan McFarlane,
although not a doctor, was quite successful in:
treating the disease," It has often been quoted
that ''Fools rush in where angels fear to tread",

In the case of the doctress Else K, this could be
applied a little differently; for here was one home-
spun angel of mercy who pushed resolutely forward
into many stricken homes where most others feared
to go - Saving a life here - giving hope and comfort
there - and leaving her benediction of service and
love wherever she went, Did she fear for her life
and those of her own children? Of course she did!
But she knew it was her duty and her destiny to
become involved, come what might. She must have
had great dedication and courage and still greater
faith, That none of her own family were afflicted
at this time seemed proof of the approbation of the
kind Heavenly Father to whom she so often and
fervently prayed,

Whether it was for some contagion, sore
affliction, pestering complaint, or for the
<span id="page-??"></span>
303 Brown Kit

important work of bringing babies she was sum-
moned, Else K, Christensen was almost always
well prepared, Sometimes she gathered and made
concoctions from smartweed, wormwood, hore-
hound, yarrow and other herbs which grew wild in
the valley. She often used catnip, peppermint and
sage tea in her treatments, She was a specialist
with hot packs and mustard plasters, Among the
medical helps which she used freely and with great
skill were, besides the previously mentioned
"blood-letting knife", a variety of lances for boils
and a suction cup to draw the pus out, She kept
all her tools very sharp and in the best of condi-
tion, safe in her medical kit, ready for use at any
and all times, To the Christensen children Else's
brown satchel was a ''mustn't touch it", To them
it held 'magic things'' with which their mother
treated the sick and the afflicted. It sometimes
held her medical journal as well, in which were
written the recipes for 'magic cures", together
with a list of the babies she had brought and other
data pertaining to her profession.

Just about spring the next year Else made
the following entry in her journal;-- 'Victor
Madsen en datter den 14 March 1888,"' This
simple statement in no way indicated the part the
birth of this baby girl was to play in the lives of
Laurs and Else Christensen and their family. Ada
Lorena Madsen, for so the infant was later named,
was the fifth child of Victor August Hastrup Madsen
(adopted son of Bishop Christian August Madsen)
and his wife Sarah Olesen Madsen, Else worked
hard to save the life of this little child and as she
worked she prayed, for some malfunctioning of
her heart was evident from the start, With special
care some progress was made in the little one's
condition throughout the weeks following her birth,
but the mother, Sarah, failed to gain back her
health and strength after the ordeal, Else spared
nothing in her efforts to get Sister Madsen back
on her feet again, but to no avail, It was apparent
that the young mother could not get well, In
despair Sarah Madsen called Else Christensen to
her bedside and tearfully pled with her to take her
baby Ada to care for and raise when she was gone,
Who could have denied the last request of this

dying mother? Not Else!

Sarah Madsen passed away Friday 25 May
1888, less than two months before her twenty-
eighth birthday. She was buried a few days later
in the Gunnison cemetery beside another baby
daughter, Almira, who had died at two years,
With the full consent of the bereaved husband,
Else took the two month eleven day old Ada Lorena
Madsen into her home and cared for the motherless
little girl as if she were her own. We have been
told that little Ada, though frail and sickly, was
very bright and of a very sweet nature and that the
nine Christensen children, as well as Laurs and
Else, took her to their hearts, This was especially
true of one year old Elvena, who adored Ada, and
the feeling seemed to be mutual between them,
They played by the hour together and Else even
dressed them alike when she could. People often’
thought the two little girls were twins, although
Elvena had very blonde curls while Ada's were
very dark, Ada was not officially adopted by the
Christensens, yet she was much loved by them and
treated as their very own. No strings were attached
to her by the Madsen family. Her natural father
gave her foster parents this written statement:--
"Thereby give my consent for my daughter, Ada
Lorena Madsen, to be called by the name of the
people who raise her, - Victor A, Madsen." So
they changed the small girl's name to Ada Chris-
tensen,

For a little more than eleven years the
people of the Church, but more particularly the
Saints in Sanpete Valley, had awaited with great
anticipation the completion of the immense and
beautiful building that was being erected. Ona
hill of solid stone jutting west into the valley from
the rugged Wasatch Mountains east of the city of
Manti, the magnificent structure had grown until
now it stood in all its glory on the crest of ''Temple
Hill", its delicate towers patterned against the sky,
It appeared like a glittering jewel on the bosom of
the mountain range. Built of oolitic stone ofa
warm cream or ivory color, which had been
quarried from these same mountains, it commanded
<span id="page-??"></span>

a superb view of the country round about, north,
south and west, It was impossible to imagine a
more eminent location for a temple and one afford-
ing greater opportunity for artistic and delightful
surroundings,

The building itself was 171 feet 6 inches long,
92 feet wide, and 79 feet high to the square, plus
the two towers reaching heavenward, the one on
the east 169 feet. These were thirty feet square
at the base but tapered upward, The walls of the
main building were 3 feet 6 inches thick at the
base, with 4-foot buttresses, diminishing to 3
feet at the square and the buttresses to about
2 feet 6 inches. The building itself, as well as
the towers, had ample window facilities. Adjoin-
ing the structure on the north was a heating plant
and annex, The grounds were terraced and planted
with vines, shrubs, trees and flowers. The public
highway ran past the temple from which the ascent
to the ground floor was over thirty feet, but a
sloping drive beginning at the north, passing under
part ofthe east edge of the building and finding an
outlet on the south, made the ascent easy. Two
lengthy flights of steps led up to the temple, a
great wide one of cement on the west and a narrow
one on the far south just east of the driveway.

The interior of the temple matched the
exterior in beauty and workmanship in every
degree, perhaps one of the most distinctive
features being the two spiral stairways of
choicest wood which had been So intricately
balanced as to need no center support at all,

The height of each of these was 95 feet from floor
to ceiling and they contained 150 steps apiece,
There were only five such unusual stairways in
the United States, including the two in this temple.
(Even today there are only five in the U. S. A.
and no other temple has the likes of these. )
Overall, the Manti temple had been a gigantic
undertaking and at the time was the finest struc-
ture yet to be erected in the Rocky Mountains,
although it was the third temple.

young calf there, a bushel of wheat gleaned by a
widow - it had all added up over the years to the
one million dollars that had been required to
build it. Now at last it was completed and the
hearts of the people were bursting with feelings
of thanksgiving as the day of its dedication drew
near. A three day celebration had been planned
and one can be sure every adult member in the
valley who was physically able, and could secure
a recommend from his or her Bishop, would
attend one or more of the inspirational meetings,
Numbers ofthe authorities from Salt Lake City
were expected, as well as caravans of church
leaders traveling in from other parts of the
Territory. Whereas at the time of the dedication
of the site eleven years before (25 Apr. 1877)
valley Saints had mostly come to Manti in slow
moving ox-drawn wagons, now they would be able
to come and go with faster teams and rigs.

On Monday, 21 May 1888, the Manti Temple
was dedicated by Apostle Lorenzo Snow, The
large assembly room, seating about 1, 500, was
filled to overflowing. Men of the Priesthood were
seated on the right, the women on the left, as was
the case in all church meetings even well into the
nineteenth century. A regional choir had been ©
practicing for months for this occasion, under the
baton of Professor Smyth. ''On the first day of the
religious gatherings in the temple, just as Pro- _
fessor Smyth was concluding the voluntary - a
selection from Mendelssohn - a number of the
Saints in the body of the hall and some of the
brethren in the west stand heard most heavenly
voices Singing. It sounded to them as angelic, and
appeared to be behind and above them, and many
turned their heads in that direction wondering if
there were not another choir in some other part
of the building. There was no other visible choir
however. . . Some of the Saints saw the spirits of
Presidents Young and Taylor, J. M. Grant, and
others, in the temple, and the heads of some of
the speakers were surrounded by a halo of heavenly
light during the services, The Saints enjoyed a
spiritual feast extending through the three days,
and many shed tears of joy while listening to the
testimonies and admonitions of the servants of God.
<span id="page-??"></span>

There can be no question but that God has accepted
the Manti temple at the hands of his Saints and will
bless all who have in any degree assisted to build

it or who, not having the means to assist, have

said in their hearts, 'I would have helped if I

could, ''' (This quote was taken from The Millennial
Star, Vol. 50, No. 26, p. 405.) Perhaps some
said then, doubting, as some may say now, ''See-
ing's believing'' - but did not Christ say, ''one

must believe to see!''?

It is hard to think other than that the
Christensens and their relatives from Gunnison
were present at the dedication of the Manti
Temple, Christen, Anne, Pauline, Lars Myrup,
Laurs and even Else must have been in attendance,
though it took place just four days before the death
of Else's patient, the mother Sarah Madsen.
Possibly they were among those who heard the
invisible choir, or saw heavenly beings seated
among them. Less than six months later most of
the above took advantage of the marvelous oppor-
tunity and entered that magnificent edifice again,
this time to do work in behalf of some of their
departed loved ones. The ''Spirit of Elijah" rested
upon them and the importance of ''work for the
dead'' was made manifest unto them. There was
no excuse for them to neglect this work now that
they had a temple near at hand; if they did, they
did it "at the peril of their own salvation", as the
prophets had said. In speaking of these things
during the dedication of the St. George Temple,
Brigham Young had stated:-- ''Those who can see
the spiritual atmosphere can see that many are
still glued to the earth. They are lusting and
longing for the things of the earth, in which there
is no profit. While we ought to look after temporal
things, we should devote them all to the kingdom
of God. Where are the hearts of the people; where
are their forefathers? What are they doing for
their own salvation and for that of their forefathers?
. . - If we were awake to this great truth this house
would be crowded from Monday morning until
Saturday night. . , This temple has been built
that people can come and labor for their salvation
and that of their progenitors, , . What do you
suppose the fathers would say if they could speak

from the dead? Would they not say: 'We have lain
here thousands of years in the prison house, bound
and fettered in the association of the filthy and
corrupt.' If they had the power the very thunders
of heaven would resound in our ears, All the angels
of heaven are looking to this little handful of people.
When I think upon the subject I want the tongues of
seven thunders to awaken the people to action,"'

On Monday, 12 Nov. 1888, Christen Christen-
sen and a number of his family made their way from
Gunnison to Manti by wagon and set up camp on the
grounds provided for that purpose just southwest of
the temple grounds. The next day Laurs, Pauline,
Anne and Christen himself went into the beautiful
temple and were baptized for dozens of their dead
kindred. For four days they labored in this sacred
building for their deceased relatives - brothers,
sisters, parents, grandparents - all were baptized,
endowed and sealed under the hands of the holy
priesthood, They did not forget to do the endow-
ments for the gentle Karen and the daughter Petrine,
or for Karen's parents and relatives who were dead,
for Christen had procured the records of them by
correspondence with her people. On Nov. 14, 1888
they had the joy of fulfilling one of their most
sacred dreams, that of being sealed together as a
family for time and all eternity. Christen's two
daughters, Nielsine, or Sena, and Caroline came
into the temple that day for this occasion, Caroline,
the only one of Christen's and Anne's children not
born in the covenant was sealed to them there.

Then Christen's and Karen's children, both the
living and the dead, were sealed to them - all but
the first son, Christen, who was still living in far-
off Denmark, apparently with no interest whatso-
ever in the purposes of the Most High. Christen
Sr, stood for himself in this last sealing, as in the
first, while Laurs, Pauline and Sena not only stood
for themselves but also alternated for their dead
brothers and sisters, Peder C., Niels C., Maren,
Ane Marie and the two Petrines. Anne stood for
the gentle Karen and Daniel H. Wells, first Presi-
dent of the Manti Temple, performed the sealings.
Sena herself had risen from a bed of sorrow to come
to the Temple that November day. Exactly two
weeks before she had laid away a five weeks old

baby son, This had been the fourth of five small
sons with whom she had been parted by death in

the past four years, Did the ceremonies in that

glorious temple give her renewed hope and cour-
age for the future?

In those early days the Saints did the work
for their own dead, or hired it done by other
Saints, Christen and Anne were most faithful in
their genealogical responsibilities. They wrote
often to the Old Country for records of their
departed kin and friends and went to the temple
regularly to act as proxies in their behalf.
According to their daughter Caroline, the practice
of going to the Manti temple continued with her
parents as long as her elderly father was able,
for she wrote:-- ''He was not only kind and con-
siderate of the living but did what he could for
the dead. He and mother went from Gunnison
to Manti by team many a Tuesday and came back
Saturday. They took their provisions with them
and camped, doing temple work for their dead
kindred and friends, They did this for many weeks
and years, when father was not busy in the fields,
farming."' The Manti temple records show that
Christen and Anne Christensen worked consistently
in that sacred building for the next nine years,
accomplishing a great amount of vicarious work
for their dead,

Il. A CLEAR CALL

Else had not accompanied her husband's
people to the temple excursion that November 1888,
for she was busy with the sick. Though she longed
to go there in behalf of her own departed loved ones
she had so little knowledge and such incomplete
information about them that she was completely
unprepared for this noble service, Even that which
she knew of her very own parents was scant indeed.
These things tugged at her mind and hung heavily
on her heart, but she had so few free moments it
seemed. Letters to her people in Denmark for
genealogical material had been most unrewarding -
they were seldom if ever answered, Else was well
aware of the statement made by the Prophet Joseph
Smith that--''The greatest responsibility in this
world that God has laid upon us is to seek after
our dead.'' She wanted to keep the commandments
above all else. She must try harder.

So towards the end of that year she wrote
again to her sisters and brother in Denmark, send-
ing them Yuletide greetings together with a care-
fully worded request for additional information on
their parents and also on their own families, She
mailed these letters with a sincere prayer in her

heart. It would likely take months to receive
answers - if she ever did. Meanwhile she went
courageously on with her work of raising her
family, including the sickly little Ada, ushering
new babies into the world and succoring the dis-
tressed. But her mind was often turned to her
kindred,

What happiness was hers when she received
the following communication from Denmark (as
translated from the Danish):-- ''Thorsted, Den-
mark - March 1889. Jens Mikkelsen Skaarup born
11 Feb, 1873; Ane Marie Mikkelsen Skaarup born

Svend Mikkelsen Skaarup born 19 Jan. 1887. --
Yes, dear sister, Ihave given you the names and
birthdates of all of our children which are the best
we own. We and you of course have the same
number, They are all well and so I can do nothing
else but marvel at seeing them. Iwas with Mads
and Stine and we decided that I should write alone
this time so that the letter wouldn't be too fat. I
am to greet you from them and say from Mads
that he will do what he can to accomplish what you
require from him. They will each write in a few
days.

"Sister Marie is moving to Thisted and she
will have a good amount of work. Stine lives in
Thisted. Her husband is named Svend Poulsen,
He is a carpenter and they have six healthy,
delightful children and two dead, Mads also has
six but they have had ten, He lives in Tingstrup,
Thisted Parish, and they have two good dwellings.
In the summer they live in Thisted.

"Our father died 10 May 1878. When mother
was dead he sold the house but kept that little room
in Norhaa, but he spent a lot of his time here with
us, The last time he left here he wasn't very well.

and I drove over to Norhaa to see him two days
before he died, He was very sick but he was
happy and contented, so I have the best of hope

for him. And now I will close for this time.

When your letter came the teacher Carl was here,
He was going to travel to America in April to visit
two of his brothers who lived here for eighteen
years. lasked him, after I read your letter, if
he would visit my sister in America.

Love from Mikkel and Karen Skaarup, "

It was almost a month before another Danish
letter came for Else and her fingers trembled as
she opened it:-- ''Tingstrup, Denmark - April 1889.
Dear Sister:- Ihave got that done which you asked
me todo. Ihave been to the Priest at Hvidbjerg
and he was very good to look back one and one-half
centuries but he could hardly go farther as the
books at that point were just loose leaves and
almost illegible writing. As you can see the
mothers of our parents are not mentioned in this
information he gave me, which I enclose; only
Kristen Kristensen and wife and Kristen Hviid and
wife - but I suppose you can remember that father's
mother is Karen and mother's mother is Else, Our
mother died 10 July 1872 and was buried on the 16
and father died the 10 May 1878 and was buried on
the 15th.

"TI shall now tell you a little about what has
happened to me in my way through life until now.
I suppose that you remember that Kristen, in his
last days, was stirred to look inward into his sin-
ful heart and consider the Lord's goodness to
repentant sinners and whatever else there is to
believe in. Immediately afterwards we other
brother and sisters came in touch with the same
way of life initiated by Grundtvig and a revival.
Iwas then at High School on Mors and I was very
happy to listen to the lectures which were held,
speaking of the lives and experiences of the
teachers, This was in the winter of 1868. In the
fall I went to High School down by Kilding (Askov
Hajskole) and stayed there for six months. In
1875 I came to Thorsted where sister Karen lives,
to hold school for some children. There I became

acquainted with a girl from Gjaerup, who worked
for Karen, and it soon became clear to us that God
had led us together. We became engaged the same
year and were married on the 25th of May 1876.

"On the 18th of March 1877 we had our first
son and he was christened and named Askel Hvid
(I had by then started to let myself be called Mads
_ Kristjan Hvid.) Onthe 16th of Feb. 1879 we had
our first girl, who was christened Valborg Hvid.
On the 11 Aug, 1880 the other girl was born and
received in her christening the name of Kirstine
Hvid (for mother), On the 24 Oct. 1881 we hada
boy, he was christened and called Kristjan Hvid
(for father), Onthe 11 Oct, 1883 another boy
arrived and was christened and called Jens Peter
but he died at 5 months, Onthe 5th Nov. 1884 a
girl was born, She was christened Marie Hvid
but died when ten days old. A few days later my
wife took ill and spent her time in bed, partly at
home and partly in Thisted, for a year anda half
and didn't have enough strength to turn over in bed
by herself. But on Nov. 9th 1885, two little ones
came, a boy anda girl. They were christened and
called after the other two who had died, Marie and
Jens Peter. On 3 Feb, 1888 we had aboy. He
was christened Johannes Hvid and he died at five
months old. On 22 Feb. 1889 our tenth child
arrived, a wonderful girl. She was christened
and named after our sister who died, Edel Petrea
Hvid. I forgot to mention that the twin, Jens Peter,
died at four months of age.

"Else Marie Pedersen is my wife's name.
She is now well enough that she got a sewing
machine this last winter and sews for all our little
ones, Yesterday she got her loom set up and wants
to start weaving. It has now been unused for nearly
seven years, Our attitude towards the previously
mentioned movement, which we were so happy
about, is otherwise now than it was before because
we think it to be superficial and not serious enough,
for these are serious times we are livingin. We
question if it is the spirit of the world that is
leading us or if it is the good Holy Ghost, It seems
to me that it appears to be the spirit or power of
the world that is ruling. But thank God we believe

in an All Ruling God and even if it is dark for us
we can sing 'The Lord is with us' and we shall
fear nothing.

Mads Kristjan Hvid - Tingstrup by Thisted,"'

On Tue. 7 May that year of 1889 Christen
and Anne went to Manti on another temple excursion
and this time Else K. went with them, and of course
they took their provisions along and stayed at the
campground near the temple, They were in the
temple for three days, during which time Else
not only assisted the others. with the work for some
of their departed but had the great joy of being bap-
tized and endowed for her own mother, Mette, and
also for Mette's mother, her own Grandmother
Else Andersen (Hvid) for whom she herself had
been named, Perhaps it was then, in the beautiful
Manti temple, realizing again how little knowledge
she really had of her own progenitors, the thought
first came to her that she should return to Denmark
and search out the records of her dead ancestors,
as well as those of her living kin, while she yet had
‘her own people in the Old Country. It was a startling
idea to say the least, How could it ever be
accomplished ?

Else had hardly been able to take time off
from her numerous duties that 7th to 9th of May to
go to the temple. Bringing babies alone was a
time-consuming business in itself, considering
the fact that she often was called to assume almost
full responsibility for both mother and babe until
the mother herself was up and around again, That
May was a busy month for Else K., according to
the entries in her medical journal:-- ''Hans C,

' Hansen datter 4 Mai 1889; Lars Olsen son 12 Mai
1889; Westenskow son 14 Mai 1889; Brigham Jones
son 20 Mai 1889; Henry Jensen datter 27 Mai 1889, ''
Indeed she was a very busy midwife and much in
demand, as this journal attested, for she listed in
it 36 babies brought by her in the year 1888 and
another 36 in 1889 - quite.a coincident, but also a
record of one of the many, many labors in which:
she was engaged during those busy years, A good
practice, however, made it possible for her to
begin to save a little of her income for the future,
<span id="page-??"></span>
315 A Clear Call
whatever that future held,

While Else was busy with her medical prac-
tice, Laurs took a great deal of the responsibility
of the family. They nearly always had a hired girl
and especially one, Christine or '"'Sena'' Lund of
Manti, who had been born near Else's hometown
in Denmark and come across the plains with them
in the Abner Lowery Company as a very small
child. Else and Emma too were getting big enough
to help some, especially with the little girls,
Elvena and Ada. But that they missed Else in the
home is a certainty, according to the son Albert:--
"Our home was always a place of love and peace.
Contention and quarreling were uncommon, While
father was a patient, kind and affectionate father,
our mother was the life and soul of the home. As
a child, when I had been away and returned, if
mother was not in the livingroom or kitchen I
would wander from room to room and if I could
not find her I would leave; the house seemed too
lonely and empty without her. Mother's complete
confidence in me and the rest of the children was
a Shield to us against dishonorable things, "'

Laurs was also away from home at times,
herding sheep, working on the railroad, freighting,
etc., to bring in a little extra, but mostly he
farmed on his forty acres or worked about the
place in Gunnison, They had pigs, chickens,
geese, a few sheep, cows and horses, with the
pens, sheds and coops to house them. They had
a good sized patch of alfalfa on their place, a few
plum trees and currant bushes, but their pride
and joy was a large, well-kept garden which

supplied so much of the family's food, Laurs
always ploughed and got the ground ready each
year and helped plant it and irrigated, but it was
Else's garden and she was a fine gardner. She
weeded, tended and fussed over the garden and
tried to have the first new potatoes, green peas,
green onions, and radishes each year, and she
usually did.

Most of the people in Gunnison had wells
by 1887 and Laurs was determined to have one on
his place. His son Albert tells how he got the
well, in his memoirs:-- "At first we used water
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Clear Call 316

from the open ditch the same as the neighbors, I
well remember when my father arranged to have

a well dug a little west of the old house and north-
west of the new. He showed Mr, William Wasden
where he desired the well to be, but Mr. Wasden
wanted to be sure that the place selected was a
place where water could be found, so he held in
front of him a forked limb, one hand upon each
prong and the main stick pointing directly in front
of him. He walked over to the place where father
had located the site of the well. This was ona
rather high area above the old home and the land
sloped eastward from here. He said that the stick
failed to indicate that there was water to be found
there. He walked all over the lot to the north and
whenever he got near the north boundary the end of
the stick would point, indicating (to him) the pre-
sence of water. Father went about his work.
Other members of the family, including myself,
were interested observers, Finally Brother
Wasden approached father to render his decision.
He said it would be useless to dig the well at the
place indicated by him, After some discussion
father said he didn't care where the water was, he
wanted the well dug at the place he had suggested
in the beginning. Brother Wasden protested,
stating that there would be no water there, ‘I don't
care where the water is' father repeated, ‘here is
where I want you to dig the well!' That finally
settled the matter and Wasden, with apparent fore-
bodings, started to dig the well as directed. It
was rather a slow process as it was necessary,
-after the first few feet, to dig through rock, In
the course of weeks, however, Wasden had dug to
about thirty feet when to his great amazement,
almost consternation, water gushed forth ina
veritable stream so that it became impossible to
sink the well farther. Wasden cleaned out the well
as best he could and then was windlassed out of the
hole with his tools, The well soon had some six to
eight feet of water in it, ample for all of our
domestic uses, That well served the family as
long as any of us lived there. As far as I know it
may still be there yet.'' Gunnison water with its
strong mineral taste was supposed to be rich in
magnesium, said to be most healthful for people.

It was not until about 1910 that most people there
had water piped into their houses,

The Christensen's new home in Gunnison was
a block west of the Relief Society Hall, which
building had been started in 1877. In June the
foundation had been laid onthe northwest part of
the public square. The main hall, 30 by 60 feet,
had walls 2 ft, thick and 16 ft. high. This part
was finished in time to hold Sabbath meeting in it
the first Sunday in December, A two-story 12 by
20 ft. 'T'' was completed later on the north end of
the hall and provided a stage and, on the second
floor, along assembly room which was used for
various church meetings as well as school. The
sisters gleaned wheat, gathered ''Sunday eggs",
made quilts and other articles to raise money,
They paid $1, 300 on the erection of their hall and
another $1,000 to help build a storage granary and
fences, Some material was donated by the brethren.
The upper room had seven windows, five facing
north and two facing south. Four long rows of
benches extended the entire length of the room and
in the middle was a large pot-bellied stove and an
oversized woodbox,

This place of church meetings was completed
by the time the Christensens had moved back to
Gunnison in 1880 and was especially convenient
for them after they moved to west Gunnison. Be-
sides all Sunday meetings, the Priesthood met
Saturday afternoon and night there, the Relief
Society held monthly meetings, the Young Ladies
Retrenchment Society met twice a month and the
Young Mens Mutual met weekly. Prayer meeting
was held on Thursday nights and Scandinavian
meeting Wednesdays. The adult and juvenile
choirs each practiced one night a week and one
night was for amusements.

On Friday, 15 Nov. 1889, Laurs and Else
Christensen and their three oldest sons, Christian
22, Andrew 20 and Joseph 183, went to the Manti
Temple together for the purpose of being sealed
together as parents and children for all eternity.
The three had not been born in the covenant as had.

in their behalf. This was done in all solemnity by
Manti Temple President Daniel H. Wells, It must
have been a soul-filling experience for each of
them, For Else herself, who was not yet sealed
to her own parents, it may have been a strong
reminder of her unfulfiiled responsibilities to her
kindred dead. In faci each new visit to that beauti-
ful edifice must have given new impetus to her
dream about returning to her native land in search
of the genealogical records of her people, past and
present. Though she had a great responsibility to
the living she also must have felt the urgency of
her responsibility to her dead growing within her
bosom,

That she discussed these things with Laurs
and even with their older children, may readily be
imagined, She may not have discussed with them,
however, her recurring dream that perhaps she
herself might be instrumental in bringing her own
people the message of the Gospel, This thought
she could not banish. As the days and weeks sped,
what had begun as little more than a dream began
to shape itself into a possibility. As she began to
view a trip back to Old Denmark it began to loom
as an almost staggering undertaking. But even as
Else weighed the situation and prayed for guidance
in overcoming the problems, she began making
tentative plans to go. The voice of her own destiny
was being heard amid the din.

Inquiries were made about the cost of sucha
journey, for money was a big consideration,
Though business for her had been good the past few
years and she had saved some, she would still be
forced to borrow additional, Passport requirements
were investigated, Fortunately she was an Ameri-
can, she and Laurs having secured their Certificates
of Citizenship the same day (20 Feb. 1882) in the
First Judicial District Court of the United States,
Utah Territory, issued at Manti. Else talked to
returned Danish missionaries - "yes'', they advised
her, "Saints going back to the Old Country on visits
often traveled there with outgoing Elders." Laurs
and the children encouraged her inevery way
possible - they could take care of things at home
they agreed. Having gone this far Else decided
<span id="page-??"></span>
319 A Clear Call

she had better write to Karen and Mads about the
possibility of a homecoming - and to Stine and
Marie. Would she be welcome among them there
in Denmark?

Well before an answer came back definite
plans for Else's trip were ursier way. She had
applied to the church authorities in Salt Lake City
for permission to travel with any missionaries
who might be leaving for the Scandinavian Mission
sometime in September 1890, after most of the
children would be settled in school. The oldest
daughter Elsie had agreed to remain home from
school that year and thirteen year old Emma had
promised to help, especially with small Elvena.
Of course Laurs would be on hand and a woman
could be brought in to help, if necessary. The
photograph for Else's passport had been taken,
and since it had been definitely decided that she
should take along their foster daughter Ada, she
too was in the picture. There was no other way
but to take the little two-and-a-half year invalid
with her, for she had made a solemn promise to
the dying Sarah Madsen that she would care for
her child, and the little girl was far too frail to
leave to the chance care of others,

Then a letter came from Else's youngest
sister, the twenty-eight year old Marie - still
unwed (translated from the Danish):-- ''Thisted, |
15 July 1890. Dear Sister Else: Thank you very
much for your letter and thanks because you are
thinking of visiting us. We cannot measure the
joy it will bring to us, Ihave sometimes said,

'I wonder if Else won't come and surprise us?'

» » 'No' the others have said, ‘that could abso-
lutely not be !' But look now if it hasn't almost
happened, We had thought it would almost be too
big a surprise and so avoided the disappointment
in that way. But now my dear, dear sister, we
sometimes imagine the moment when you shall
come and then believe me we are filled with joy -
but then when you leave again it will be hard. You
must tell Kristjan hello for us and say that we
think he is magnificent to give you, his wife, the
liberty to make such a journey - and may the good
Lord bless him for it. And if it so be that it
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Clear Call 320

comes true, then we will make it as pleasant as
we can for you and make sure you get safely home
again to the far west, for that is where you belong.
Yes, may the Lord give you strength and courage
so that this fall will bring you good woman here.

"The old ones want to live until you come;
namely Niels Vorup and Kristen Larsen of Norhaa,
Yes, here is joy all over at the thought of your
homecoming. Ihave so many greetings for you!
June 6th I went to Hordum to visit Aunt Maren.

She takes care of one of the officials 'Sognefogeden'
in the Parish there. While there I also went to
‘Old Aunts' and then, since Maren had told me that
Mette, who is married to Jens Krog of Spaels, had
hurt her thigh, I decided to visit her also, The
following day I went through Norhaa and although
IThadn't been there since not long after you were
here, I still could recognize everything. I went

to Kjallerup to see Kristen and Maren Hvid and

got these names I am enclosing for you. They

said to tell youhello. I then went to Mettes. She
is a little better but still in bed. She has four sons
and a daughter. One son, Anders, lives in the
home for poor people. He is married and has five
children, although I think his wife is a little strange.
Another son is a bricklayer and lives at Thyholm
and one is a grocer in Copenhagen. One Son is at
home to help Jens Krog. The daughter, Ane Marie,
is twenty-eight years old and a nice, good girl and
so clean and happy. She went with me to Lavst
Lykkes, for I wanted to tell Kristine about you.

She said to send you her love, She has been quite
broken down with sorrow. They have had four
children but about three years ago one boy in his
fourteenth year was drowned down in a brook,

Then a little girl died and now they have only a

boy and a girl, It has struck her hard, Lavst has
been sick for sometime with an abdominal infection
and she worries about that too, as he has it so
often. Her husband is from Svendborg but this
year he has bought Uncles whole house so now they
are living in Aarup, I visited them on my way
home for I wanted to go by train from Snested to
Sjoring; for now we have trains in Jutland you know.
One runs from Thisted to Struer - the stations are
Thisted, Sjoring, Turbol, Snested, Hordum,
<span id="page-??"></span>
321 A Clear Call

Bedsted, Hurup, Ydby, Lyngs, Hvidbjerg and
Oddesund du Nord. However the train runs so
slow you almost get places as fast when Mikkel
Skaarup delivers his meat by horse.

"Yes, you can believe it will be nice when
you come and I guess I] am the one who-can, best
of all, close my door and go with you - so you
shouldn't be so anxious to get me married off!
But believe me little Else, Ihave had my part of
trials and tribulations but these can wait to be
told until we can be together ina short while, if
it may happen. But I have lived as rich a youth
as is granted only a few. I have enjoyed a good
life ever since my earliest childhood and I will
continue to the end. I pray the Lord every day
that he will give me strength and that he will lead
me, whether it be through married or single life.

"Tell Kristjan (they called Laurs that)
'Hello', we would like to know him personally.
Karen has a good spacious cottage. There is
room for much good at a place like that - it is
the best place I know. Ihave spent many happy
days there, But you must not think anything else
but that sister Stine's and brother Mads' homes
are happy and pretty too, It is fortunate that you ©
write on good paper for believe me your letters
are getting read diligently. You apologize for
your letters without reason, but ours need toler-
ance. It makes us and many others happy that
you remember your native language so well. We
are all fine. Ido not know if they will all write
this time, if so their letters should come today
so they can be sent together, You have all come
closer to us lately. My address is - Cook Marie
Andersen, c/o Bricklayer Hansen, Stationsvejen
No. 310, Thisted, Jutiand,, Denmark."

Else's eyes were wet long before she had
finished this letter. All the homesickness of a
quarter of a century welled up within her and
spilled over. Oh to hear the sound of the sea and
taste its salt on her lips again - to greet her
sisters and brother Mads once more - to lock
arms and walk and talk with them as of yore - to
sit together in the quiet of the evening and watch |
the moon come up out of nowhere! But there was
<span id="page-??"></span>

little time then for reminiscing and less for weep-
ing, so much had to be accomplished in so short a
time. She delivered four babies in July and another
four in August, including one more son to the oft
bereaved Sena and Anthony Madsen, 28 Aug. 1890.
In September she delivered another little one, a
son, to one Jens Madsen, then she set aside her
brown kit for a time in favor of a small trunk and
a large valise, well packed for a three months trip
to Little Denmark. And then the time had flown,
last minute advice was in order all around and
goodbys were being said. Did three-and-a-half
year old Elvena cry and cling to her departing
mother, finding it difficult to understand why she
should be left at home while two-and-a-half year
old Ada was being taken along?

Whether Laurs took Else, little Ada and
their luggage by wagon to Salt Lake City to join the
group of L. D. S, missionaries with whom they
were to travel, or whether he dropped them off at
the nearest railroad terminal at Indianola, we are
uncertain - probably the latter. Nevertheless the
two joined the group of thirteen Elders who left
Salt Lake City by eastbound train just prior to mid-
September 1890, which included the following bre-
thren; Edward H. Andersen of Ogden; Jens N,
Hansen, John O. Rosenkrantz and Pehr Cronquist
of Logan; Harold F, Lilenquist and Michael Johnson
of Hyrum; Peter H, Sorensen, Jens H, Kofoed and
Thor C, Nielsen of Brigham City; Pehr N. Pehrson
of West Jordan; Andrew Hansen and Andres C,
Johnson of Pleasant Grove, all from Utah, and
Christian H. Poulsen of Franklin, Idaho, These
were more than a third of the total thirty-six
missionaries who left Zion to serve in the Scandin-
avian Mission that entire year of 1890,

It should be remembered that the past few
years in Zion had been a period when the great anti-
polygamy drive had been gaining momentum among
the enemies of the Church, and at its height had
taken on more the appearance of an anti-Mormon
crusade, Having commenced in earnest in 1884,
under cover of the Edmunds law, it had been
carried on from then with great hostility and
increasing vigor, not only by individuals and
<span id="page-??"></span>
323 A Clear Call

anti-Mormon groups but by Federal officers and
courts in Utah and Idaho as well. Arrests and
imprisonments in the hundreds each year had con-
tinued unabated. The fines collected were enor-
mous, The Utah Penitentiary had been constantly
filled with the brethren who were found guilty of
infractions of the anti-polygamy laws. Under pro-
visions of the Edmund-Tucker act, the government
had taken possession of the Church offices and a
wholesale confiscation of Church property threa-
tened. In fact, the question of whether or not the
Church could be robbed of its property by the
government had even been laid before the supreme
tribunal of the country; and also the question of
whether its individual members could be robbed
of their civil and political rights because of their
religious beliefs,

The close of the year 1889 and beginning of
1890, political developments in Salt Lake City
became highly demonstrative. The Liberal Party,
representing the anti-Mormon population, began
carrying on a most vigorous and at times vicious
campaign against the Church in general, but more
particularly the incumbent Peoples Party, which
was supported by the Saints. Truly the political
pot was boiling in Utah the beginning of the year __
1890. The election was held on 10 February 1890
and we turn to historian Andrew Jenson's Church
Chronology to find out how at least the Saints felt
about it:-- ''The municipal election in Salt Lake
City, for which so much planning had been done,
resulted in victory to the Liberals who, through
the grossest frauds, managed to obtain possession
of the City government, . . Sat. 15 Feb. - Ex-
Judge Orlando W, Powers was banquetted by the
Liberals in Salt Lake City and presented with
$10,000 as a reward for manipulating the Liberal
municipal campaign. , , Wed. Feb, 19 - There
was a grand Liberal jollification with parade and
fireworks held in Salt Lake City.'' Thus the civil
control of Salt Lake City, as was also true of
Ogden and a few other Utah communities, passed
from the hands of the Pe ples Party to those of
the Liberal Party, or anti-Mormon element; and
even before the tumult and shouting died, nearly
all the civil rights left to the Saints were
<span id="page-??"></span>
A Clear Call 324

threatened by anti-Mormon legislation. And so
things stood in the ''Promised Land" as Else and
little Ada joined the company of missionaries who
left Salt Lake City, Utah bound for Copenhagen,
Denmark.

That the impact of this situation in Zion
should have been felt in far-off Scandinavia seems
unusual, nevertheless it was, according to Albert
L. Zobell Jr., in his ''Under the Midnight Sun",
from which we quote:-- ''The enforcement of the
anti-polygamy laws against the membership of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had
its effect in the Scandinavian countries, especially
after the American Ambassadors and Counsels
abroad received their instructions not to extend
any protection to American citizens who were
engaged in missionary work in the interest of the
Church. The civil authorities on the island of
Bornholm, Denmark, were the first to issue
- edicts of banishment against the Elders and others
followed, including those in the city of Aalborg,
Scurrilous articles were published in Copenhagen
newspapers and those in Bornholm and other places,
slandering the Saints and their doctrines, Lutheran
Priests gave illustrated lectures against the Church
and anti-Mormon stories could be heard on every
hand, Anton H. Lund, then President of the Scan-
dinavian Mission, called on the United States
Minister in Denmark and asked him if American
citizens could be banished from that country without
atrial, as they had been. He received little satis-
faction in the answer, ''I believe they can; there is
some law that gives them arbitrary power to expel
foreigners.'' So even abroad the Saints were not
protected; it began to look as if the Elders from
Zion would not be permitted to continue their
missionary work in Denmark since the government
had decided to banish them.

The year 1889 had begun with new mobbings
and threatened violence to the Mormon missionaries
and their congregations, More of the Elders were
"advised" to leave the country, and did. But on
the whole the intelligent Danish citizens, and even
most of the Danish authorities, knew well that the
Danish Saints were a loyal and law-abiding people,
<span id="page-??"></span>
325 A Clear Call

sustaining the government and taking no part in
the political agitations of the day. This went a
long way in finally convincing the authorities that
banishment ofthe Elders was not in keeping with
the general spirit of freedom of which the Danes.
were intensely proud. And so it stood in Denmark
when the group of travelers from Salt Lake City,
including Else K. Christensen, reached Copen-
hagen 28 Sept. 1890,

One of their number, Elder Edward H.
Anderson, immediately succeeded Brother
Fjeldsted as President of the mission there,
Elders Thor C, Nielsen and Andrew Hansen were
appointed to labor in the Aalborg Conference. It
was to this area of Jutland that Else herself was
going. How different this brisk two-and-a-half
weeks trip to Denmark must have seemed to her
when compared to the five-months-long journey
of twenty-four years before, when she had left
there and gone west by sailing vessel and ox-
drawn wagon train. Though she traveled ''3,
Klasse'' on the east-going ocean liner, her
accommodations must have seemed almost "regal!"
when compared with those afforded by the ''Old
Kenilworth" of long ago.

We cannot help but be amazed when we think
of this courageous, undaunted woman, now nearing
her forty-fourth year, going forth with a sickly
child on one arm and her bulging handbag on the
other, directing the disposition of her other
luggage as she transfered from American train,
to steamship, to Danish train, canal boat or ferry,
as the case demanded, or cared for the food require-
ments and other personal needs of little Ada and
herself as well. Did her mind sometimes find
time to dwell on prospective answers she might
give to her Danish kinfolk when they asked about
Mormon polygamy? She knew well that her rela-
tives would be "up on things", She would have to
face the issue as squarely as possible. We wonder
how long it was before she learned that four days
before her company had landed in Copenhagen, on
24 Sept. 1890, President Wilford Woodruff, under
divine inspiration, had issued his famous ''mani-
festo", advising the Saints ''to refrain from
<span id="page-??"></span>

contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of
the land'! and also that the same had been accepted
by the unanimous vote of the Saints in attendance at
the semi-annual conference of the church, Oct. 6
that year in Salt Lake City.

How wonderful for her to be in Old Denmark
once again. . . Land of red flags with white
crosses whipping in the October breeze in every
public square and from every sailing craft upon
the many waters, , . Land of amber, green sea-
washed islands, blue fjords and bays. . . Ancient
land of her fathers, even back to the Vikings of
Old. , . Land of the beautiful Limfjord which
caressed the eastern coast of Thy. .. Land of
bells ringing from towers and churches! The only
church bell ringing in all of Sanpete Valley, U.S.A.,
as far as Else K. was aware, was the one now
hanging in the belfry of the new Presbyterian
Church in Gunnison. She missed bells,

2. WITH FLAGS FLYING

Word of her hour of coming had gone ahead
to her loved ones there. When she arrived at the
railway station in the beautiful city of Thisted, on
Jutland, she was met by the husband of her oldest
sister Karen, Mikkel Skaarup. Though they had
never met he had doubtless been directed to "look
for the woman with the child on her arm", He had
come in a beautiful carriage with a coal black team
of horses and soon they were riding through the
countryside of Thy, headed a bit north and some
three miles west from Thisted, to the village of
Thorsted, where Mikkel and Karen lived with
their eight sons and one daughter, ranging in ages
from seventeen to three years, The Skaarups
owned a nice roomy cottage and a big farm in
Thorsted, It was harvest time - soon they would
be threshing their grain,

When they entered the village and drove past
the white church and out to the Skaarup place,
Danish flags were flying from cottages and flag-
poles, 'What Danish holiday or celebration is
this?'' asked Else, as she viewed them. ''We fly
<span id="page-??"></span>

the flags because our lost sister has returned to
us'', answered Mikkel, ''why shouldn't we cele-
brate?'' And what a festival it must have been
when Else was reunited with her three sisters and
her brother Mads; for we have been told that they
were all gathered there to greet her. Then she
needs must meet their families, for they too had
all come. Besides Karen's and Mikkel's nine
children there were Mads' frail wife Else and
their six living children, two boys and four girls
of ages one-and-a-half to thirteen-and-a-half, and
Stena's husband, Svend Poulsen, and their three
daughters and three sons from fifteen years to
five months old, It was difficult to straighten out
all their names! Marie of course had no one - but
she made up for it in most loving greetings. Yes,
all had come to see the much-talked-of Aunt Else
from America and her small foster daughter Ada.
Wonderful children they were too, thought Else,
but none any finer than her own six sons and three
daughters back in Zion!

And back in Zion midsummer of that. year,
the Board of Examiners for Church Schools, with
the approval of President Wilford Woodruff, had
chosen Gunnison as one of the places to hold three-
day examinations for prospective teachers, The
exercises had been held July 28-29-30, 1890, in
the Relief Society Hall, with Dr, Karl G. Maeser
presiding and educators from Randolph, Bear
River, Wasatch and Sevier conducting tests on
the theory and practice of teaching theology,
grammar and composition, orthography, elocu-
tion, geography, history, hygiene, arithmetic,
bookkeeping, penmanship, drawing and music,
This event had been looked upon with great
interest inasmuch as it had been the first of the
kind ever held in Zion, Joseph Y, Jensen was one
of the Sanpete Valley residents to apply and be
granted a teachers license at that time.

Seminary teaching commenced that fall in
Gunnison and this was held in the upper room of
the Relief Society Hall. Joseph Y, Jensen was
appointed Principal. The Bible was studied on
Mondays and Thursdays, the Book of Mormon on
<span id="page-??"></span>
With Flags Flying 328

Tuesdays and Fridays, and Wednesday was testi-
mony day. Of course numbers of other subjects
were taught in addition to theology, including
Domestic Science for the young women. On
Friday nights the Philosophical Society presented
lectures, readings, musicals, etc,, and these
were great affairs.

Albert Christensen was one of the some
seventy-five students attending the Seminary
classes and activities that fall and recalled some
of his experiences in these words:-- 'In the fall I
started school at the Gunnison Seminary. Joseph
Jensen was my Seminary teacher and a splendid
one. I greatly enjoyed my work, While I was a
little rusty as a student, I soon began to find
myself. One day we had as a lesson the learning
of the names of all the countries of South America
and also the capitols of those countries, It
happened that either by neglect or for some other
cause I was unprepared, It was a surprise to me
to find that the entire class likewise was unpre-
pared, The teacher said, 'If Albert can't get the
lesson you may all be excused', I concluded that
if the teacher had such confidence in me I would
see to it in the future that I was prepared. ..

This was about the first year that I had engaged

in social activity such as dancing and other public
entertainment, Needless to say it opened up to me
anew world. It was a happy year both at home and
at school. My mother had gone to Denmark to
visit her people but returned sometime during the
year. My sisters Elsie and Emma, who helped
care for the home, had seemingly grown up during
my absence, My father was always handy with
home duties and was most agreeable at all times."'

Among the many other students to attend the
Gunnison Seminary that fall and winter of 1890/91,
besides Albert, were his brothers Andrew and
Joseph, as well as Christen's and Anne's daughter
Caroline and sons Andrew and John T., and Miss
Roxie Bartholomew of Fayette. Albert's older
brother Andrew, who had been out of school for a
number of years, had begun to realize the fallacy
of not having an education, as is told by his daugh-
ter Edythe:-- "More than once I've heard father
<span id="page-??"></span>
329 With Flags Flying

tell of leaving home at age thirteen to work, It
was in the employ of one Julius Christensen. It
was in the solitude of the mountains, while watch-
ing his employer's sheep, that Andrew dreamed
his dreams and made his resolves - he would
re-enter school! A strapping young man, older
and taller than most of his classmates, he came
back to face the lower classroom of Gunnison
Seminary, where he buckled down to work in
earnest,"

Albert's sister Elsie tells of her enrolling
in the Seminary about mid-term, as foilows:--
"At age fourteen (1889} I went to the Snow Academy
in Ephraim, which had been founded the year
before, on 5 Nov, 1888. My brother Joseph aiso
attended then, This was a preparatory and inter-
mediate school, In the fall of the next year (1890)
I kept house for my father and family while mother
and a foster child went to Denmark to visit her
folks, Her family there in Denmark celebrated
the return of 'their lost sister'. After she returned
home I started to attend the Seminary in the Gunni-
son Ward, Joseph Jensen was the teacher. This
was in January 1891.'' So as it was, ail of Laurs
and Else's nine children were living at home while
she herself was visiting in far-off Scandinavia -
that is all but the oldest son Christian, who was
away with the sheep. Six, and later seven, were
in school. Nothing made this couple happier than
to see their offspring seeking after their educations.

Else spent the better part of three delightful
months visiting the land of her birth and the loved
ones of her youth. There were plenty of baby-
tenders to watch little Ada and give her freedom
to visit all around, True to her word, it was
usually her unmarried sister Marie who had closed
her door and gone aiong with her to visit the "old
ones" and all their other living kinfoik in Thy.
Before Elise had left her home in Gunnison she
had taken her scissors and hurridly snipped out
eighteen blank pages from her medical journal
(those between 35 and 71) These she had placed
in her handbag and brought with her, and as she
traveled on foot, or by Danish train, carriage or
wagon from village to village and cottage to

With Flags Flying 330

cottage greeting her relatives, she had questioned
them and jotted down names, places and dates of
births, and any death dates of parents and children
in each particular family, until these pages were
filled. Although most greeted her with exuberant
affection, none would have ought to do with the
doctrines of Mormonism. This was particularly
so when she visited her brother-in-law Christen,
down near Hurup, which she had faithfully promised
both Laurs and Christen Sr. she would do, Though
she received scant enough welcome at his home, |
nevertheless she wrote down the name and other
information about his wife, Else Maria, and their
‘two daughters with the rest, and accepted a photo-
graph of the four to take back to his people in
America,

She wept at the graves of her parents in the
churchyard at Norhaa; gazed once more upon the
cottage in Kjallerup, where she was born; but most
of all she walked and talked with Mads, Karen,
Stine and Marie, or sat with them in the evenings,
And while they continued to extend to her the kindest
hospitality and most sincere love, they would have
no talk about religion, Neither did they know much
about their genealogy, except for the tradition that
their mother's father's people, the Hvids, were of
the nobility -- way back, In the midst of all the
jollities, festivals, and genuine happiness of being
together with her loved ones and their families,
there was a deep well of disappointment in Else's
heart as time drew on and she was unable to speak
to any of the Gospel, They had heard and believed
far too many rumors of Mormons, Would she ever
have another chance to teach them the truth? Not
likely! Denmark and America were far apart and
who among them there knew the-length of their
years? And then, when the Jutland wind was
howling cold and the long snows had begun, there
came the inevitable packed bags - the tearful
goodbys - a blur of red and white flags flying in
the distance, and Else was sailing west again.
"Well there goes Denmark - she's a Lovely Land!"
But soon she began to look for land the other way;
she would keep Christmas in Zion, :

ones during her absence; also that the Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad had reached Ephraim, only
some twenty miles from Gunnison. That is perhaps
where Laurs drove his wagon to meet her and the
weary little Ada on their return trip home that mid-
December 1890, The towering, snow-capped

The cry of a new-born babe in the night -
another - then another - "Lars C. Hansen - son -
January 1891. , , Titus Christensen-son-February
1891. . . William Wasen-son-February 1891...
Lundgren-datter-March 1891.'' As the new decade
called the ''Gay nineties'' was ushered in, Else K.,
Christensen picked up her brown kit again and went
back to ushering in babies in Gunnison Valley and
making entries in her journal. And while she was
so busy taking care of the living she found little
time to do anything for her dead, even though the
words of her blessing must have kept ringing in
her ears:--'', , . You have come forth here on
earth in order to accomplish a great mission,
along with your husband, for your father's and

mother's lineage, those who are now dead are in
prison and wait to be freed by you and your family."
Laurs, on the other hand, often went to the Manti
Temple to do work for his dead with Christen and
Anne, who were ever faithful in this work. Ona
number of these occasions he did work for Else's
deceased male relatives - her father, grandfathers,
uncles, and her dead brother Christen,

Else found herself a new cause to work for
early that year - helping to straighten out the
political inefficiency and mismanagement in the
Territory; for, according to church historian
Andrew Jenson, ''Under the Liberal Party rule,
Salt Lake City became a regular rendezvous for
foot pads, burglars and thieves; immorality,
<span id="page-??"></span>
With Flags Flying 332

wickedness and lawlessness had full sway; taxation
was made oppressive and unjust.'' This condition
was also true in Ogden and some of the other more
populous areas where anti- Mormons were gaining
control, The church authorities became alarmed
and issued a call for the membership to take an
active part in the political activities in Zion. The
church-supported Peoples Party was dissolved and
its former members advised to affiliate with one
or the other of the national parties, Republican or
Democrat, Thus on May 20, 1891 the first Utah
Republican Party was organized and later nominated
their State ticket and the Utah Democrats followed
suit, organizing on June 20 and having their nomin-
ating convention July 8, 1891, In the territorial
election which followed, August 3rd, the Democrats
elected exactly twice as many members to each of
the two legislative bodies, the Council and the
House, as were elected by the Liberal Party. The
Republican vote was light. It was not until 1894
that the Republicans began showing more strength
in the valleys and the Liberal Party was dissolved.

Utah had enjoyed small political influence in
the country up to this point. Her various repre-
sentatives to the national assemblies, if Mormons,
were seldom seated without long drawn-out trials
and tribulations. Many of the Saints in the valleys
were continually deprived of their voting privileges,
especially those who were polygamists. Though
the Territory was Democratic as a whole and Salt
Lake County Liberal, the nation itself was under
Republican rule in 1891; Benjamin Harrison,
Republican, having been elected United States
President Nov, 6, 1888. This president seemed
largely sympathetic with the cause of the Saints
and on a number of occasions commuted the unjust
sentences of various Utah citizens or pardoned
them entirely. On Sat, 9 May 1891, President
Harrison visited Salt Lake City and was received
with great enthusiasm by the large crowd which
gathered from far and near, He was replaced as
president of the nation by a Democrat, Grover
Cleveland, but before leaving office the forepart
of 1893, Harrison issued a proclamation of amnesty
to polygamists for past offenses, but recommended
vigorous prosecutions against future infractions of
<span id="page-??"></span>
333 With Flags Flying

the Edmunds law. This act opened the door for
the restoration of property and civil rights to the
much beleaguered Saints.

Else K, Christensen joined the party of
Lincoln, the Republican, and became one of its
staunchest supporters in Gunnison Valley. It was
jokingly said of her that ''she could spend all day
shearing sheep and then go and give stump speeches
for the Republican Party half the night'' in her
enthusiasm for this cause, It has also been stated
that from the time she was first given her voting
franchise she never failed to cast her vote in an
election to which she was entitled, as long as she
lived. She valued this privilege highly. Her
Danish sisters didn't begin to enjoy the same right
until 1915, during the First World War, although
naturalized women in Utah had been granted their
franchise on 2 Feb, 1870, It was while Else was
living in Gunnison that she was sent as a delegate
from that district to the Republican State Conven-
tion in Salt Lake City, to assist in the selection of
the Republican state ticket, One might rightly
have called her "Mrs, Republican of Gunnison
Valley!" Laurs too was a Republican as long as
he lived and as long as the party was in existence
in Utah, and was undoubtedly just as staunch in
his conservative convictions as Else, but obviously
much less outspoken and demonstrative,

The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad finally
came to Gunnison Valley the spring of i891. The
first depot was located in west Christenburg on
the main road from Mayfield to Gunnison and about
two miles from Gunnison proper. As the "iron
horse'! first came puffing down the track, people
were on hand from miles around to witness the
great event, Little children screamed, horses
bolted, and men and women wept for joy. A gala
celebration followed, By 13 June the train had
arrived in Axtell, and by 30 June as far south as
Salina. The boom of the railroad building, which
had sparked the economy of the area for twenty
years, pretty well ceased by the end of that year.
A depression began and by 1893 was so severe that
wheat, the main medium of exchange, sold for as
low as 30¢ per bushel. Laurs had worked at
<span id="page-??"></span>
With Flags Flying 334

railroading at one time or another, during that
period, and more recently Joseph and Albert had
been employed, helping to build the grade between
Sterling and Gunnison and saving what they could
of their wages in hopes of being able to attend the
Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah.

This dream became a reality for them and
others of the Christensens, as told in the auto-
biography of the daughter Elsie:-- "In the fall of
1891 I went to Provo with my brothers Andrew,
Joseph and Albert, and Viola Sorensen, to attend
the Brigham Young Academy, Sister Capson, Vio's
grandmother, kept house for us. The school was
held inthe Z, C, M. I. warehouse, near the rail-
road station. The roar of the trains and the shriek-
ing of the whistles were not conducive to the best
school work but this was the best that could be had
at the time.'' Actually, the Academy building had
been destroyed by fire on Sunday 27 Jan. 1884 and
the upper floor of the warehouse was being used to
house the school while a new building was under
construction,

Laurs and Else had loaded up their wagon
that fall with bedding, clothing, food supplies and
cooking utensils - all the necessities to get their
four children and the others settled at housekeeping
in a place they had located for them about three-
and-a-half blocks from the warehouse in Provo,
Then they drove up there by way of Levan and
unloaded the supplies at the low adobe dwelling on
Ath South and 142 West, the first house east of the
millrace where the Christensen youths and their
party took up quarters. There were three separate
housekeeping units in the House, The Christensens
and company had two rooms, which must have been
a bit crowded for six adults; Esther Ercanbrack
and her group from Goshen had two rooms, and
the William Ashworth family of seven had four
rooms,

Following the Christmas holidays the
Z. C, M. I, warehouse was bandoned by the
students, as Elsie relates:-- "January 4, 1892,
the teachers and students, with the band playing,
marched to the new building of the B. Y. Academy
between 5th and 6th North Academy Avenue (now

University Ave.) On that date the veteran educator,
Karl G, Maeser, was released as President of the
Academy and Benjamin Cluff was installed as his
successor,'' The Christensens continued to live

in the House of Many Doors until the end of that
school year however, The old Z, C. M, I, ware-
house stood until this winter of 1967/68 and has
just now been torn down. The House is still stand-
ing, although its adobes have long since been
plastered over and painted a pale green, The
Christensens called this dwelling the ''Knudsen
Place'! since it was owned by Hans and Birgetta
Knudsen when they lived there,

In the spring the wagon came again from
Gunnison to take the Christensens and their things
back home, and the next fall it brought them back
to school again. Roxie Bartholomew and her
younger sister Sarah came up from Fayette to
attend B. Y. A. and Maren and Lars Myrup's
oldest son, Lewis, came up with the Christensens.
Though boarding houses changed each year, the
method of transportation did not. For the next
several years the Christensen wagon went back
and forth each spring and fall, often camping on
the way, moving the students of the family and
their things to and from school at B. Y. A. and
more often than not the mother Else would be
driving. We have been told that friends in
Levan used to watch for that wagon each fall and
when sighted would say, ''There go the Christen-
sens - the B, Y. A. can now open its doors!!!
Additional supplies were sent up from home when
needed. Some autumns Else came up and stayed
in Provo for several weeks in order to get the
young people settled. This was true the beginning
of school in 1894, when the daughter Emma joined
the others at B, Y. A.

This educational opportunity would not have
been made possible without the sacrifices and
efforts of Laurs and Else, nor would it have been
possible without the unselfish assistance of the
older son and brother Chris. This should never
be forgotten! Though Christian never had the
opportunity for much formal education, he was
unstinting in the monetary assistance and
<span id="page-??"></span>
With Flags Flying 336

encouragement he gave to his brothers and sisters
in an effort to further their educations, Ina history
of Christian, written by his daughter Pearl, men-
tion is made of this:-- ''Christian, being the oldest,
had little chance for an education in school. His
mother, having had a good education, taught him
so that when he entered school he was ready for
the upper grades, He studied very hard when he
had the opportunity, and had an excellent memory.
Christian worked and saved enough money to help
his three brothers and two sisters through school
at Provo. Ihave been told that he saved two
hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces to assist in their
educations, He visited them at Provo once and
paid for having all their pictures taken, When it
was time for their graduations he paid for gradua-
tion pictures, bought new graduation outfits and
attended the exercises, When they all returned
home to Gunnison a big dinner was served by their
mother in honor of the occasion,.'' Yes, it was
largely through the encouragement of their father
and their older brother Christian, but perhaps
more especially of their mother Else, that six of
the nine living Christensen children (all who would
take advantage of it) had some college training.
Four of them qualified for graduation at B, Y. A.
(later B. Y. U.); five became professional
teachers, two later graduated from an eastern
university, and one studied abroad. In Gunnison
Valley they gained the reputation of being a very
well educated family - and much of it was ''done
on a shoe string", so to speak,

It was inevitable that the Christensen youths
should marry and leave the nest, Of course their
parents were concerned that they select worthy
marriage companions. Likely Else counseled each
of her sons and daughters, at one time or another,
as her mother had counseled her, --''When you
choose your life's mate it is the whole future of
your own blood that you are choosing!" Albert
related an interesting conversation he had with his
mother on this subject:-- 'I had never permitted
myself to think about getting married, as Iwas
primarily interested in obtaining my legal education,
<span id="page-??"></span>
337 With Flags Flying

It was well known to my parents that I had the
ambition to become a lawyer, I had occasionally
taken out a certain young lady and, as far as I
knew, she was suitable in all respects, I pre-
sumed my mother knew that Iwas going out with
her. It came to my attention that, in talking to
one of the neighbors, mother had incidentally
remarked that she hoped that I would not marry
this particular person, Shortly thereafter I
approached mother and told her that Ihad some-
thing very special that I wished to talk to her about.
I asked her to come into her bedroom, and accord-
ingly she accompanied me into the bedroom and I
closed the door, A chair was placed for her, and
taking a seat directly in front of her I said, 'Mother,
Iam thinking about getting married', She seemed
stunned - too surprised to speak; and then I added,
'T would like for you to find me a suitable wife',
She threw up her hands and exclaimed, 'That's
your business ~ I'll have nothing to do with it!!

I said, 'Well, if that is the way you feel, I wiil
assume the responsibility but I wanted to have it
clearly understood between us''', And that ended
that and the young lawyer-in-embryo had won his
first case,

Joseph was the first to marry. He: went to
the Manti Temple Wed. 6 Sept. 1893 and Laurs
and Else went with him. They must have been
delighted with the girl he chose - Roxie, the eldest
daughter of Bishop Bartholomew of Fayette. The
Bartholomew family had been among the first to
settle in Fayette and was considered outstanding.
in many ways - but particularly in overcoming the
wilderness and in devoted service to the Lord.
Indeed, Roxie came from fine stock, Her father,
John Bartholomew, was Presiding Elder and then
Bishop of Fayette for forty-seven years in all,

In their new rock house in Fayette he and his
capable wife, Eliza Roxie Metcalf, had entertained
many of the General Authorities over the years,
including church president, Wilford Woodruff, who
was a favorite visitor in their home, Two more
of the Christensens married into this family,
Andrew marrying Roxie's younger sister Sarah,
also in the Manti Temple, Wed. 1 July 1896, and
Elsie marrying their brother Alma inthe same
<span id="page-??"></span>

temple, Wed, 26 June 1901. As their children
came along there were many ''double cousins"!
among the Christensen and Bartholomew des-
cendants, It has been said that Sister Christensen
and Sister Bartholomew got their heads together
and tried to make a fourth match between their two
families but Elvena Christensen and Henry Barth-
olomew didn't see things their way.

The oldest son Christian was the second of
Laurs' and Else's children to marry and it was to
his childhood sweetheart, Caroline Larsen, that
he was wed, It had always been felt that Chris
would marry the daughter of their old Christenburg
friends and neighbors, Ole H. and Inger Larsen.
They chose to marry at Gunnison during the Christ-
mas holidays, Dec, 29 that winter of 1893. Her
parents gave the couple a fine wedding party that
Friday at 4 o'clock in their nice winter home in
Gunnison, and we can be sure the Christensens
were all invited. ''The lovely bride wore a beauti-
ful dress of robin-egg blue satin with orange
blossoms in her long, blond hair.'' The newlyweds
rented their first home but began building their
own house right away. This was less than a block
east and across the road south from the home into
which Chris had moved with his parents as a small
boy, when the Christensens had first come to
Gunnison twenty-three years before; for he was
now twenty-six while Caroline was twenty-two-
and-a-half. In two years the white rock house was
finished and the two moved in, along with their
year old daughter Pearl.

As each of the Christensen children were
married they could at least expect one of Else's
homemade quilts and a pair of her down-filled
pillows. Else always kept geese and with the
coming of each spring the ritual of plucking their
down came too, Though not as hard as shearing
sheep, nevertheless this job took a lot of pluck,
with the frightened geese honking and almost
screaming in pain - though 'tis said it didn't hurt
them overly much. Winters found Else stuffing
pillows or carding the wool she had sheared from
their few sheep in spring and making it into batts
to line the quilt tops she had pieced from scraps,
<span id="page-??"></span>
339 With Flags Flying

Then she would get out her quilting frames; she
nearly always had a quilt set up winter, spring

and summer, Though she seemed to prefer com-
munity and church work to sewing and cooking, she
did plenty of these and did them well. And oh the
hundreds of pairs of black wool stockings she knit!

Christen's and Anne's children were also
growing up and getting married. Their oldest
and only daughter, Caroline, was wed that same
year, Friday, 3rd Nov. 1893, in Gunnison, Later
she went to the Manti Temple and was sealed to
her husband, John Jensen of Axtell. John was the
son of Josiah Sr, and Marie Madsen Jensen, some
of the first settlers of Axtell, John and Caroline
settled in Axtell where he had a nice farm and
here all their children were born, The first, a
girl they named Annie Lillian, born 17 Feb. 1895,
later to become Mrs, Sidney Martin Peterson, who
has helped so much with this history. She md her
brother Alonzo Jensen, born 28 Dec, 1897, are
still living. But Caroline had misfortune with her
children after that and lost first a girl and then
four boys, one after the other, the first four being
stillborn and the last only living long enough to
draw a breath, All five of these were of course
unnamed,

The year 1893 was not only an important one
for the Christensens but for the LDS Church as
well, At April Conference that year the glorious
Salt Lake Temple, which had been under construc-
tion for forty years, was dedicated, But the
temple had been thought of even before that when
on July 28, 1847, four days after the Pioneers
first entered Salt Lake Valley (and when Lauritz
Mathias Christian Christensen was six days old
we might add) President Brigham Young was walk-
ing over the barren ground of Salt Lake City with
some of his associates, the site had been selected.
Wilford Woodruff became President of the Church
and as such had the privilege of offering the dedi-
catory prayer in behalf of the Salt Lake Temple,

6 Apr. 1893, The dedicatory services were
repeated almost daily until 24 April, thirty-one
meetings in all being held in honor of this great
<span id="page-??"></span>
With Flags Flying 340

event, These were attended by a total of nearly
75,000 people. Were any of our Christensens
among them? Very likely. But it seems the
Christensen sons and daughters favored the Manti
Temple in which to be married for eternity; for,
whether by choice or convenience, eight of the nine
eventually entered its portals for this sacred ordin-
ance. Only the oldest, Christian, and his wife
Caroline had their eternal marriage performed in
the great Salt Lake Temple - but that is another
story.

This was an important year for Gunnison
also for near its close, under the power of the
Sanpete County Court at Manti, Gunnison finally
became a town (late 1893), Efforts to incorporate
had been made in 1878 and again in 1881, but these
attempts had not materialized and Gunnison had
remained a precinct for thirty-four years, The
first town council met in January 1894 and Anthony
Madsen was selected as town president. Plans
were made to build a new city hall and a school
house, ordinances were set up and other town
officials appointed, It must have been at this time
that Else K, Christensen was chosen as Gunnison
town doctor, for although no recorded statement
to this effect has yet been found among early
Gunnison records, which are at best very incom-
plete, it has long been known that she served as
such when the town was first incorporated, Since
her brother-in-law, Anthony Madsen, was then
serving as town president it seems logical to
conclude that he had some influence in securing
Else's appointment at this time, And who else in
the Valley was more qualified? How long she
served or just what her duties were as such, we
have no way of knowing,

Else had discontinued her public practice as
midwife the forepart of 1893. The last entries
that appear in her medical journal in this regard
are the following:-- ''Nordfelt - datter - 13 Jan.
1893; Henry Jensen (Mayfield) son 19 Jan. 1893;
Chris M. Jensen (Mayfield) son - 22 Jan. 1893;
Chris Gravenstien - son - 24 Jan. 1893,'' In some
histories that have been compiled about Else K.
Christensen the statement has been made that she
<span id="page-??"></span>
341 With Flags Flying .

delivered some 2, 000 babies in Gunnison Valley
during her public service there as midwife. This
is highly erroneous, It is questionable if there
were half that many babies born in all, in this
Sparcely settled valley, during the thirteen-and-
a-half years Else was carrying on her practice.
Sometimes numbers have a habit of growing, as
babies do, Actually, in her journal Else lists a
total of three hundred and twenty-one babies that
she delivered from June 1879 to Jan. 1893. We
know she delivered others later, including a num-
ber of her very own grandchildren, but these are
not recorded in her journal.

Though a specific century may create but a
ripple in the main tide of world affairs or leave
small mark on the subsequent course of its history,
yet it is highly important to those whose spans of
life are cast in that period, We cannot disassociate
people from their environments and their heritage,
be it physical, political, economic, social or
spiritual. The tapestry of man's character is
woven of many fibers - his home, his parents,
family and friends, his associates, his own person-
ality, his religion, the land in which he lives and
what goes on in that land. The quality and depths
of such influences make up a good part of the fiber
which runs deeply and broadly through the cloth of
his character and usually determines his individual
integrity or turpitude, be that as it may. The
stronger and richer the fibers the more durable
and beautiful the tapestry.

3, AND SHOULD THEY DIE

In Gunnison little Ada grew paler and weaker,
but still she smiled from her sick bed as the
Christensens made every effort to ease her pain
and try to make her happy. She had lived much
longer than had been expected, under the strain of
an inefficient heart, during which time she had
endeared herself to the entire family with her
sweetness and patience. At the turn of the new
year, 3 Jan. 1897, the child passed quietly away.
She lacked a little less than two months of being
nine years old. She was survived by her real
father and stepmother, two own sisters and one
brother, as well as her foster parents, Laurs and
<span id="page-??"></span>
343 And Should They Die

Else Christensen, and nine foster brothers and
sisters, who mourned her passing in very truth,
for she had left a vacant place among them and a
sweet memory that could never be replaced,
Indeed this gentle little soul had done her best to
shed happiness within the home where she had
been so lovingly welcomed,

Little Ada was buried on the Madsen plot in
the Gunnison Cemetery beside her own mother
Sarah and baby sister Almira, and near the grave
of a little half sister, Ethelind Florence Madsen,
who had died soon after birth six years before.
Ada's tombstone bore this inscription:-- "In loving
memory of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and
Sarah Madsen - Born Mar. 14, 1888 - Died Jan. 3,
1897 - In sore distress your life has past - You
loved us all while life did last - Reared by Laurs
M. C. and Else K, Christensen,"

It is thought that both Laurs and Else were
among those who attended the wonderful celebra-
tion that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the
arrival of the first pioneers to Great Salt Lake
Valley, 24 July 1847. The year 1897 was an
extra special Jubilee Year in Utah. In January
plans had been made by the State Legislature to
"conduct a celebration that would attract national
attention,'' Gunnison Valley residents joined the
crowds, the largest ever seen on Salt Lake City
streets, to witness the spectacular events of the
five day semi-Centennial celebration - the dedica-
tion of the Pioneer Monument surmounted by the
bronze statue of Brigham Young - a reception for
all surviving pioneers - daily parades and speeches -
a carnival and fireworks, On Sunday, 24 July, a
memorial was held in the Tabernacle to honor all
deceased pioneers, Laurs and Else wore their
official ''Pioneer Badges" to many Pioneer Day
celebrations. These were among their cherished
treasures,

But most cherished of all their treasures
were of course their children. It is wonderful to
have parents who uplift and encourage their child-
ren to pursue challenging goals and who support
them when they meet the inevitable frustrations
and reverses of life. Not all were as fortunate
<span id="page-??"></span>
And Should We Die 344

as the sons and daughters of Laurs and Else
Christensen in this regard. We know of one little
girl who was born in far-off Sweden. When she
was about three years old her father took his own
life and her young mother was forced to return to
the shelter of her father's home, taking her little
girl with her, A few months later another little
girl was born to this unfortunate young mother,
The embittered father, though a widower in failing
health and needing his daughter's care, seemed to
begrudge her little children even the crusts of
bread that went into their mouths, making things
most miserable for them all.

It seemed an answer to this unhappy mother's
prayers when she received a small sum of money,
coming to her children from their father's mother's
estate, their grandmother who had emigrated to
Zion and died there, With a prayer for wisdom in
her heart, the young mother had taken the precious
money and paid the fare for her oldest daughter,
then six years old, to go to Zion to the home of
some of her father's other relatives there, in fact,
his half-brother who lived in Salt Lake City. The
little girl was sent in the care of some returning
Mormon missionaries in the fall of 1895, The
mother had planned that somehow she and her other
little girl would join this older daughter in Zion in
the near future - but this she was never able to
manage. The small Swedish emigrant's half uncle
in Salt Lake City was a polygamist, with two wives
and two separate families, Times were hard for
them and money for the necessities of life was
scarce and with many mouths to feed little Anna
Theresia Carlson was not too welcome among
them - neither did she speak the language. After
a time she was shifted about among various families
here and there - Salt Lake City - Schofield - Gunni-
son - Centerfield - finally winding up, when eight
years old, inthis latter place in the home of an
elderly couple whom she never learned to know
well or feel at home with and who were in no way
related to her, as far as she knew. But they sent
her to school in Centerfield for the very first time,
with her lunch wrapped up in paper - a sandwich of
dry bread spread with bacon grease. She was always
hungry. So after a few days of school here she ran
<span id="page-??"></span>

away, or rather wandered away and became lost -
and nobody came to find her, A mid-September
dusk in 1897 found Theresia in northwest Gunnison,
hungry, cold and forlorn, She fell asleep that night
on the steps of the Relief Society Hall. The shouts
of happy children gathering on the nearby school
grounds next morning awakened her, Lonely and
disheveled she sauntered over to join them, but
the school bell sounded and they rushed into the
schoolhouse and she was left alone again, having
no desire to follow them in, Nobody seemed to
mind her and she hung around the school until
morning recess brought the children out again,

She joined a small group of girls, seemingly about
her own age of nearly nine. She was a stranger to
them and questions flew fast: ''Where do you live?"
She said she didn't know - which was probably true.
"Where are your father and mother?'' She had no
father and her mother was far away. ''Don't you
have a home?'! No, she had no home - no place to
go. Among the group was a tender hearted little
girl whose last name was Fredrickson. She lived
just kitty-cornered northwest from the Relief
Society Hall nearby. She took Theresia home

with her and told her mother that her new-found
friend had no place to go, ''Can't she live with us
mother?" Sister Fredrickson, overburdened with
alarge family, answered, ''We'll see'! and her
daughter scampered back to school, leaving the
strange little Swedish girl in the hands of her
mother,

Sister Fredrickson looked the child over,
she was a beautiful girl but so neglected looking,
After trying to make her feel at home and listen-
ing to her tearful little story, told in haulting,
broken English, she considered the situation while
Theresia ate hungrily of the food she had given her.
Then the kind Sister said, "I know just the place
for you my dear, Some people down the block
have recently buried a little girl about your age.
Come along with me!'' And so they went west to
the end of the block, Sister Fredrickson and Anna
Theresia Carlson, whom henceforth we shall call
'"Tresia' but let her tell part of her own story.
"Twas shifted about from one family to another
until I didn't have a place to live. A lady knew
<span id="page-??"></span>

someone who had just lost a little girl named Ada,
so we went to see her, Sister Christensen called
her husband in from outside and they talked things
over and then said one more mouth wouldn't make
any difference with them; so Iwas takenin, It
reads like a book. They were so wonderful to me!
There are no words written or spoken that are good
enough to describe them, They treated me as their
own. If Vena got new shoes - I got new shoes; if
Vena got anew dress - I gota newdress, The rest
of the family were grand to me too,"

So once more the Gospel of the Master came
into action in the home of Laurs and Else Christen-
sen of Gunnison, for had it not been said, ''Be ye
doers of the word and not hearers only. . . dry up
the tears. , . comfort the sorrowing. . . ease the
pain of the sick. . , share with the hungry and
needy. ..'' And little Ada's empty bed was filled
again and Elvena had a playmate and companion in
the home, younger than she by nearly two years,
to be sure, yet in the matters of the world, much
older and wiser, They went to school together and
Tresia took the surname of Christensen as long as
she lived with them and attended school there in
Gunnison, which was for some six or seven years
after that. Today Tresia lives in Maricopa, Cali-
fornia and is in her eightieth year, the only one of
those living today who once mingled intimately
within the confines of this Christensen home. And
how well she remembers those days when first she
came to dwell there. Vena was the only one of the
family attending school then in Gunnison, except
herself as mentioned. Christian was of course
married and mostly away with the sheep; Andrew
too was married and teaching in Kanab; Joseph,
also married, was teaching in Centerfield but
living in Gunnison; Albert was beginning his first
year of law school back in Ann Arbor, Michigan;
Elsie was also teaching in Centerfield and driving
back and forth; Emma was teaching in Spring City,
and seventeen year old Louis and fifteen year old
Arthur were with the sheep on and off, helping
Chris with the various herds, although Papa and
Mama, as Tresia always called Laurs and Else,
would have much prefered having them in school,
And what teases those two younger boys were!
<span id="page-??"></span>
347 And Should We Die

Death struck often in those early days in
Gunnison ‘Valley and the Christensens and their
loved ones could not always escape the hand of
the Grim Reaper, Laurs' youngest sister, Sena,
or Nielsene Christiana as she had been christened,
had had some misfortune with her children, having
lost four out of nine sons sent her over a period of
twelve years, three of them one after the other,
She had been wed to Anthony Madsen 18 Oct, 1883
some three months after the death of her sister
Maren Myrup, when she was twenty-one and
Anthony, who also came from Kobberod, Jutland
where she was born, was twenty-three. Sena's
tenth son was born 21 July 1898 but died the same
day before he could be given a name. Sena herself,
youngest child of Christen and the gentle Karen,
followed this last of her little ones in death the
next day, 22 July 1898, which was the fifty-first
birthday of her brother Laurs. She was thirty-six.
Mother and babe were buried in the same casket in
the Gunnison cemetery. Anthony Madsen married
again in less than five months, for he was sorely
in need of a woman's help with the five surviving
sons, the oldest nearing fourteen. He was wed to
a Danish girl, Nielsena Necolena Dortary Nielsen,
or "'Lena'', The ceremony took place in the Manti
Temple 14 Dec, 1898. Onthis same occasion the
necessary work was done for the departed Sena
and she and Anthony, with all their sons both
living and dead, were sealed together as a family
for eternity - and Lena stood for Sena, Lena her-
self gave Anthony two sons and two daughters but
only one of each kind lived to present him with
grandchildren.

There are times of exaggerated sadness
accompanying death, Who can say whose passing
is most mourned, that of a much loved child, a
young so-much-needed mother, or one of the ''Old
Ones''who goes to the grave trailing his accumu-
lated years of struggle, courage and overcoming
behind him? Christen Christensen passed away
Tue. 21 Nov, 1899 in his eighty-third year, going
down like a fine hewn log, an honest man well
seasoned with experience and great faith. He
wasn't sick very long; pneumonia took him, He
seemed to know he was going and 'tis said that in
<span id="page-??"></span>
And Should We Die 348

his last hour he insisted on Anne straightening and
smoothing down his clothing all around him, wish-
ing to be as immaculate in death as he had always
tried to be in life, If, as some Danes believed,
there was a gathering of all one's dead ancestors
over the earth at an Old One's passing, then there
must have been a great unseen host of both relatives
and friends waiting to greet Christen Christensen
from Thy, when he died. He had done so much for
the living over the years, and he had done so much
for the dead, laboring consistently in the temple
not only for his relatives but for great numbers of
his deceased friends as well.

This was an honorable man and his word had
been as good as his bond, Not only had he served
and loved man, both the living and the dead, but he
had loved animals too, especially fine horses, He
had reared many thoroughbreds in his day and was
always kind to the dumb beasts. We have been told
that he was very particular about housing and feed-
ing his animals, never going to bed at nights until
he was sure they were all right and had plenty to
eat. Their stables and mangers were cleaned every
day. He studied about animals and numbers of
people brought their ailing livestock to him to be
treated, We like to think of Christen Christensen
as somewhat of a thoroughbred himself; for, though
homespun, he was a fine and noble gentleman in
every way - and from the ancient Danish Vikings
in a straight line. But there was little fanfare
when they laid him away in Gunnison - no bell
tolled for him, Red flags of warning were on
many gateposts there for the whole town was under
quarantine for smallpox, No inside congregating
was allowed so the funeral itself was held outside
in front of the home in the bleak day-dark of Sat.
Nov. 25, 1899.

Christen was survived by Anne and five of
her six children, three of Karen's children includ-
ing the eldest son Christen in Denmark, numerous
grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Andrew, son of Laurs
and Else, was then attending school in Ann Arbor,
Michigan. One night he saw his grandfather Chris-
tensen, dressed as for travel and with a valise in
<span id="page-??"></span>

his hand, come walking through the door and up to
the bed where he was sleeping. The surprised
Andrew asked, ''Where are you going?'' His
grandfather Christen replied, 'I am going to Den-
mark to hunt my genealogy", and then he dis-
appeared, A few days later Andrew was informed
of the death of his grandfather, 21 Nov. 1899, the
same night the old gentleman had visited him ina
dream or vision.

For some years Anne continued to live in the
old home, together with her son Joseph who never
married, She was a humble woman of great faith
and always thanked her Heavenly Father every day,
even for the small things of life such as a good bed
to sleepin, She had been very good to Christen
and Christen had been kind to her. They had spent
some thirty-three years together, sharing the
hardships and sorrows as well as the joys of life,
among the latter of which could be counted their
labors together in the beautiful Manti Temple.
Christen had been able to raise money to bring
Anne's sister, Mary Jensén, over from Denmark
and get her established in Zion, which was also a
great joy to Anne. During her later years she
sold the old home and she and Joseph moved
closer into town. It was to this new location that
Anne's daughter, Caroline C, Jensen, came often
from Axtell to care for her mother in her last
days, for she suffered greatly at the end and passed
away 3 Apr. 1914 of what was thought to be cancer,
A monument of some consequence, as Gunnison |
tombstones go, marks the place where Christen
Christensen is buried, along with his wife Anne
and two of their sons, in the Gunnison cemetery.

As the grandsons of Christen Christensen
grew to manhood in Gunnison, there began to be
some confusion among those who carried the
Christensen surname and also bore the same
given names as other Christensens in that small
community. Laurs and Else had a Christian,
Andrew and Joseph; Christen and Anne had a
Christen, Andrew and Joseph, and there were
other Christensen families there at the same
time in a similar fix, These same-named
individuals were always getting their identities
<span id="page-??"></span>
And Should We Die 350

and mail mixed up, to say the least. Finally the
sons of Laurs and Else decided to do something
about it and most of them assumed middle initials
and changed the spelling of their surname from
Christensen to Christenson; to the latter of which
generations of their Christensen progenitors must
have looked askance. But no matter, from this,
Christian "I", Andrew 'B'", Joseph 'C", Albert 'H"!
and Louis 'D'' Christenson emerged. Not to be
wholly outdone, some of their half-uncles also
adopted middle initials but left their surname
spelling intact. Thus there were now Christen
'"K'", or Chris Krat as he came to be called,
Andrew "'E''and Joseph ''Y'' Christensen. These
name changes were never legalized except through
long usage and some of the Christensons eventually
went back to the original Danish spelling of Chris-
tensen, The spelling of this surname has since
been used interchangeably among the various des-
cendants of their common progenitor, Christen
Christensen from Thy,

Albert H. Christenson, now a full fledged
young lawyer, married Ellen Virginia Snow, whom
he called "Jennie", in the Manti Temple Wed. 26
Sept. 1900, She was the granddaughter of Col,
Warren Stone Snow of Black Hawk War fame,
Tresia remembers that Laurs and Else drove up
to Manti in a two-seated rig to attend the wedding
reception that night at the Snow home, taking
Elvena and herself with them, Both of the girls
had new shoes for the occasion. As was the cus-
tom in those days, a fine wedding supper was held
at the home. Tresia especially remembers the
small glasses of Dixie wine that stood at every
place on the long table. At the end of the meal,
when the adults had left the table and moved to
the parlor, she and some of the other children,
including Elvena and Jennie's young twin brothers
Joe and Ed, who had been given no wine, proceeded
to drink up the wine that was untouched. Tresia
must have gotten more than her share for the last
she remembers she was being lugged upstairs by
the bride's stepmother, Aunt Lydia, and put to bed
for the remainder of the evening. These were the
<span id="page-??"></span>

remembrances of an eleven year old. But those
of the twenty-two year old bride were quite
different, as Jennie Christensen recalled it thus:--
"How my mind will travel back to our wedding
night. We, Albert and 1, had sewn autumn leaves
on the curtains in the afternoon for decorations,
That night it was chilly and raining hard, but I
hardly noticed it, so bright did it seem inside,

We had fires in the grates, We came downstairs,
A. and I, and went into the parlor which was filled
with guests, What an array of flowers was about
the rooms, I remember I was so proud of him!!!

Louis D. was married to Sarah Florence
Mellor of Fayette, 6 Mar. 1901, in the Manti
Temple, Her people had also been among the
first settlers in Fayette. But her mother was
dead and her father, a polygamist, lived with his
other family, while Florence pretty much had to
look after her younger brothers and sisters as
best she could, Tresia remembers that Florence
and her sister made her wedding dress out of
white "china silk'' which she saved and later used
the material to make a christening robe for her
first child and daughter LaFaun, The Christen-
sens gave the couple a wedding celebration and
dinner at their home in Gunnison, Not long after-
wards Louis left on a mission for the.Church to
the Western States Mission in Colorado (June 1901)
but he was not there very long before he was called
back home because of the desperate illness of-his
bride,

Elsie was married soon after Louis left for
his mission, This is as she recorded the event in
her own history:-- 'On 26 June 1901 Iwas married
to Alma C, Bartholomew of Fayette, Sanpete Co.,
Utah, in the Manti Temple by John D. T. McAllister,
then temple president, After the ceremony, since
we had been invited by my brother Albert and his
wife to come to their home for dinner after we
were through, we went down to their house on
Second West, but found no one home. However,
the door was unlocked and a large bowl of lovely
fresh fruit centered the table, to which we helped
ourselves, My parents gave us a very elaborate
wedding reception in their home that same evening.
<span id="page-??"></span>
And Should We Die 352

There were one hundred invited guests, including
four Bishops,"' Elsie was twenty-six years old at
the time and Alma was not yet twenty-three, for
there were three and a half years difference in
their ages,

At the beginning of this new century there
were prosperous times in the United States.
President William McKinley had successfully
steered the Ship of State through the turbulent
waters of the Spanish American War which had
been largely brought about by Spain's shameful
treatment of her colony, Cuba. So many Cubans
died a terrible death from starvation, Uncle Sam
stepped in and told the Spaniards that they could
not continue their heartless oppression of these
people and sent the battleship Maine into Cuban
waters to back up the statement if necessary. The
Spaniards more or less thumbed their noses at the
U. S. A. by blowing up the Maine. McKinley
declared the Cubans to be free and independent and
went to war to enforce it. Spain had part of the
Philippines in her possession too, and the Filipinos
were also fighting for their independence at this
time. The U. S, A. sent a fleet into Manila Bay
to assist in the protection of the rights of the
struggling people of the Philippines and in the fight
which followed, destroyed the Spanish Armada
there, In a few months the Spanish American War
was over, and under the terms of peace Cuba was
given her freedom and Spain sold the Philippine
Islands, Porto Rico and another of their small
islands to the United States for $20, 000, 000.
During the war Hawaii requested protection and
was also annexed to the United States,

The successful outcome of the war and the
prosperity of the country resulted in President
William McKinley being elected to another term
of office at the general election held Tue. 6 Nov,
1900, The Republican ticket in Utah also won by
alarge majority. Less than a year after the
beginning of his second term of office, or on Fri.

6 Sept. 1901, the President was attending the Pan-

American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. A man
by the name of Leon F, Czolgass joined a receiving
line where McKinley was shaking hands with people.
<span id="page-??"></span>
353 And Should We Die

Raising his apparently injured right hand, wrapped
in a large white handkerchief, as if to shake the
hand of the President, Czolgass fired two bullets
into him with the concealed gun he held and, as
William McKinley fell, said with satisfaction:

"T done my duty." As soldiers and spectators
rushed to the assassin, the mortally wounded
McKinley cried out, ''Be easy with him boys,"
When questioned, the anarchist stubbornly main-
tained that he was convinced it was a good thing
for the country to have killed the president.
Czolgass was electrocuted,

All of the nine children of Laurs and Else
were of course living at the time of President
William McKinleys assassination, Eight of their
grandchildren were alive at the time of McKinley's
death - Chris and Caroline had daughters Pearl
and Elora and sons Elmer and LeRoy; Andrew and
Sarah had a son Adelbert and a daughter Edith
(later Edythe); Joseph and Roxie had a son Harold,
but had lost three little babies straight in a row
after that; while strange as it may seem, Albert
and Jennie had their first child, a daughter Virginia,
on the very day President McKinley was shot. All
of the nine Christensen sons and daughters were
eventually given away in marriage, And though
this giving may have seemed a sacrifice to Laurs
and Else at the time, it proved to be a blessing
like "bread cast upon the waters", returning to
them after many days numerous grandchildren
to honor and cherish their names.

SONS

"To press my lips upon a fair cheek, or a brown,
Of my young sons - so long Ihave stooped down,
But suddenly to my surprise

i find that I must lift my eyes to meet their eyes;
That I must stand on toe tips

And reach up to kiss their lips,

These tall young sons - straight as any pine -
Can they be mine?

Soon I must share them, soon I know

That they must go.

But Oh, Iam so glad that I had

Small sons to stoop to, tall sons to reach to

Clean sons to give
That others might live,"'

--Grace Noel Corwell

Pearl remembers when Joseph and Roxie
moved into their new home in Gunnison, They had
a big house-warming and the place looked beautiful
for the occasion, especially inside. The parlor
walls were blue and rope had been gilded and tacked
around near the ceiling to form a border, the color
scheme being blue and gold, Joseph was then in
the bishopric in Gunnison Ward and also teaching
school there. Roxie was expecting her fifth baby
and hungry for one, since Harold was almost eight.

October came, and Joseph went to Salt Lake
City to attend General Conference and also to be
present at U. E. A. which was to be held after-
wards, He left his mother in charge of Roxie who
was looking for the new baby any day. Else had
delivered several of her grandchildren before this,
along with hundreds of other babies, but as far as
she knew, no one could put more strength into
childbirth than her daughter-in-law Roxie. What
pains.. . . what hours and hours of hard labor, . .
how many trips walking around the block, with help
from brothers, father or husband. . . what agony
preceded every birth. It would take six weeks after
for Roxie to get her strength back, Little of course
was known then of modern medicine and the treat-
ment was crude and even rough, but it was all they
knew. It didn't help much either for expectant
mothers to be urged to "eat for two'' and to be
passed seconds at every meal.

This fifth baby was overdue. Finally, on
Tue. 7 Oct. 1902, the little girl came, but she
had been too long in the birth and was limp and
blue and wouldn't cry. Else took the little one in
her arms and, using all her remedies and skills,
putting her first in warm and then cold baths,
worked against time to save the baby. And as she
worked she prayed aloud the whole time - ''Father
please save the life of this child. . . her two little
sisters and one brother are dead, . , please save
her, . . Roxie and Joseph need this little child. . ,
please let her live!"" For two hours she worked,
<span id="page-??"></span>
355 And Should We Die

and cried to the Lord to save little Ruth Ellen, or
‘"Root'! as she always called her after, She paid
little attention to her daughter-in-law during that
time, except to report to her at intervals - 'A
little moisture on the eyelids, . . A little color
in the upper lip, . ."'

When it was finally safe for the child to be
left alone, Else put her down in the place that had
been prepared for her and then took care of the
mother, Roxie, When all was at last in order,
she sat down and wrote her report to her son
Joseph, addressing the letter just ''Bishop Joseph
Christensen, Salt Lake City, Utah.'' Another
Bishop Joseph Christensen of Salt Lake City, who
had been born in Gunnison, where his mother still
lived, received Else's letter. This Brother had
no idea his wife was even expecting and it almost
caused complications in his home. Years and
years later, Ruth chatted with this other Joseph
Christensen while he was ona church assignment
in San Diego, California, and he still got a chuckle
out of that experience. To the ever-thoughtful
Else K. this had seemed the proper thing to do on
that occasion, She said she often did things she
had never thought of doing before, through inspir-
ation, and more often than not things turned out
all right. She usually heeded the whisperings of.
the ''still small voice"! that came to her so fre-
quently. She was a woman of great faith - and she
had such faith in prayer! She had prayed over
hundreds of babies and their mothers in the
delivery rooms of Gunnison Valiey, as she had
also worked and prayed over hundreds of others
of her patients, But she had also wept as well -
wept over some who had passed away.

4, THROUGH YESTERDAY'S WINDOWS

"We live in the past through knowledge of
its history, and in the future through hope and
anticipation, By ascending to an association with
our ancestors, by contemplating their examples
and studying their characters; by partaking of
their sentiments and imbibing their spirit; by
accompanying them in their toils; by sympathizing

in their successes and triumphs, we mingle our
existence with theirs, and seem to belong to their

tt!
age. --Daniel Webster

So many have participated in remembering.
In her memoirs Aunt Elsie tells of her father:--
"While father could not do heavy work in his later
years, he did his share in caring for the home
whenever mother was away. He held many posi-
tions of trust in early day Gunnison, After the
railroad came to the valley he was freight collector
for a number of the mercantile establishments,
including the co-op store where he was also watch-
man for many years, He also hauled freight to
Manti and other areas, He was a school trustee
for years too. He eventually held the office of
High Priest in the church, being ordained to this
office on 7 Aug. 1904, and in the early part of the
twentieth century was called to receive a special
blessing in the Manti Temple because of his faith-
fulness in his calling in the priesthood, Our home
was a happy and congenial one and father was
especially kind. He never lost his temper, Both
father and mother were devout people, busy raising
and providing for their large family but always
giving help to neighbors or wherever help was
needed, practicing honesty in their dealings with
man and God,"

Tresia remembers how grandfather used to
run races with the children and walk on his hands
to entertain them. Some of his grandchildren
recall how he used to perch them on his foot or
knee and bounce them up and down in ride-a-cock-
horse fashion to the rhythm of a Danish rhyme he
chanted, ''Ride, ride ranke - hesten hedder Blanke -
fdllet hedder Abilgraa-og den skal lile 'Harold
ridepaa'"' and then he'd toss the rider high with
much merry laughter; and whether it was Harold,
Elmer, Roy, A. Owen, Lucien, Wendell, Byron,
or one of the little girls who rode, each always
clamored for more, Sometimes he pulled in fun
at the children's fingers, one by one, as he tried
to teach them the Danish names for each - Tommel-
tot, Slikkepot, Langemand, Guldbrand and Lille
Peder Spillemand. Yes, grandpa Laurs always
<span id="page-??"></span>
357 Yesterday's Windows
seemed to have time for the children.

Tresia remembers that after she gave up
her public medical practice, grandmother Else
took boarders, The builders who put up the first
brick homes in Gunnison were among them, Tresia
says, ''Your grandmother could cook if she needed
to, but she liked community service and church
work better, She was always very active in the
Relief Society. She kept her own garden, which
grandfather ploughed and helped plant, and she
took care of the chickens and geese, Each spring
she plucked the geese to fill her pillows and each
newly married couple in the family got a pair of
those pillows for their wedding. She spent her
egg money with care. Each fall after threshing
she put new fresh straw in the bed-ticks and under
the rugs as well, She had a large loom and wove
rugs and carpets and was a great quilter, though
she wasn't much for fine sewing. Piecing, tying
or quilting quilts and tearing and sewing rag rugs
was a never-ending process with her, Your grand-
father raised the sheep and she helped shear them
(she could shear a sheep as good as any man),
washed and carded the wool and made it into batts
for the quilts or spun it into yarn and dyed it for
stockings, of which she made legions. How I
hated to wear those black, itchy stockings!"

Tresia also remembers that Aunt Roxie did
all of grandmother's sewing for years, after she
and Joseph were married, She made all of grand-
mother's dresses then and those for Vena and
Tresia, There was always a new dress for the
girls for Christmas, She remembers that Millie
Gledhill from down the street worked for grandma
when she took boarders, and Bell Wasden from
across the road did too, Tresia recalls how grand-
mother used to like to have her hair combed by
Elsie, Emma, Venaor Tresia, During some of
her few idle moments she would fall to sleep and
nap in her chair while one or the other of them
combed or brushed her long hair, It was sucha
beautiful head of waist-length auburn hair,
slightly streaked with grey then, and she wore it
in heavy braids wrapped into a bob on top of her
head, pinned up with large hairpins and amber
<span id="page-??"></span>
Yesterday's Windows 358
colored hair combs.

Tresia remembers what ''cut-ups'' Louis and
Arthur were, but especially Lou, who at times
seemed to be full of the ''Old Nick" himself, Tresia
was mostly on to their tricks but the trusting Vena,
ever free from guile, often bore the brunt of their
mischief, Like the time the two boys had, for
some misdeed, received their usual punishment of
being sent to bed without their supper. This is
related by Elaine, as told to her by Aunt Vena:--
"The boys induced Vena to dress up like a "poor
child" and go to their mother with a story about a
family of starving children watched over by a sick
widow - the lines were well rehearsed beforehand -
‘and could you, dear Sister Christensen, please
spare a little bread and milk for them?' Else, the
soul of charity, fixed up a tasty supper which was
to have been duly taken up the back stairs to the
waiting brothers, But then Vena giggled and her
mother, seeing the whole thing in a nut shell,
brought her hand down with a spat on Vena's back
part and she was hustled off to bed in disgrace for
contributing to the delinquency of her older brothers,

Elaine remembers other things Aunt Vena
told her:-- ''There was the time her 'dear brothers'
put her down the well where she was supposed to
hide for a game and then went off and forgot to
bring her back up. And there was the time when
Lou and Arthur induced her to lie in the ditch (in
place of the bridge) and scare grandmother when
she came up to the corral at evening to feed swill
to the pigs, Else came with a full bucket in each
hand, as scheduled but unforeseen by Vena, and
before the girl could yell out to scare her stepped
right on her stomach, which threw them both into
a fright and upset the buckets, drenching Vena in
watery garbage, Then there was the time when
Vena had saved up eggs enough to buy a coveted
blouse. Carrying the eggs in a basket and accom-
panied by grandmother, she went carefully up the
weed-bordered sidewalk toward town, As they
came to a wooden bridge spanning an irrigation
ditch, they stepped simultaneously on a loose
board, Vena, who weighed less than grandmother,
flew into the air and landed on, in and under the

ill-fated eggs,"

Ruth Ellen remembers her mother Roxie
telling about the good soup grandmother Else used
to make, 'She would cook up a big pot of it - a
soup bone, plenty of vegetables and spices and
Danish dumplings. About the time the family was
ready to sit down to eat, grandmother would
remember that 'Old Sister Hansen would like a
taste of this soup! and dispatch Louis or Arthur
to Sister Hansen's with some in a small lard
bucket. Then she'd recall that 'Brother Nielsen
might like some nice hot soup' and she'd send the
other boy off in the direction of Brother Nielson's
with another small pail of soup. By the time the
large family sat down for soup there was hardly
enough left to satisfy the hearty appetites. Truly
grandmother was the soul of generosity. '!

Tresia remembers when the tall, dark and
handsome Swede, Charles Peter Peterson, came
courting the dark-haired, rosy-cheeked Emma.
He came in a smart one-seated rig and brought
her box after box of chocolates which she passed
around and then put carefully away in her bureau
drawer, Like little mice, Tresia and Vena would
stealthily help themselves to the bonbons, one
after another; but if Emma knew, she was too
sweet and too much in love to lose her temper
about it, Charles drove Emma to the Manti
Temple in that selfsame rig, Wed. 30 Sept. 1903,
to be married, That evening her parents enter-
tained family, neighbors and friends at a wedding
supper at their home in Gunnison, Emma was
twenty-six then and Charles was twenty-five, but
once every year he caught up with her for one
month and two days during June and July. Charles
had a house all ready for his bride on property he
owned one mile east of Gunnison, They called the
place the ''Bar Double C Ranch ( ).

Millie Gledhill's younger sister, Mary G.
Dowdle, remembers that the Gledhill and the
Christensen girls were playmates in the early
days, and always the best of friends. How the
neighbor children loved to go to Grandma Chris-
tensen's, She always had some little treat for
them - cookies, buns or Danish pastries of some

sort. When older the two youngest Gledhill girls,
Mary and Sylvia, did a lot of singing together and
were considered very good for that time. They
sang ''Alexander's Ragtime Band" and ''Whispering
Hope''in that part of the country for the first time
they were sung there. Millie also did some public
entertaining with them on occasions, At one time
Vena Christensen was ''Goddess of Liberty" at one
of those wonderful small town Fourth of July cele-
brations they used to have down there,

Millie's younger brother Albert (Bert) Gled-
hill, whose mother died when he was in his teens,
writes of 'Grandpa and Grandma! Christensen:--
"T say Grandpa and Grandma because they were to
me just that - and the only ones I ever knew.
Enough could never be said about the good they did.
Anyone who needed could always get a good meal
and bed from them. They helped me in many ways.
May I remind you that Grandma was the only medi-
cal help we had in Gunnison for a long time, and
how well Ido remember that she ran a spoon down
my throat every other day all one winter, Grandpa
and Grandma Christensen gave me, as they did
many others, a home when I had no place else to
go. May God bless the memory of those two
wonderful people is a prayer in my heart - and
right now a tear in my eye.

"During the early days in Gunnison Grandpa
and Grandma kept a boardinghouse and my sister
Millie worked for Grandma, helping with the house-
work and cooking. Of course this brought Arthur
Marinus Christensen and Millie Jane Gledhill
together in courtship.'' Indeed, the two were
courting even while Arthur was attending school
at Brigham Young Academy in Provo, for love
will find a way! A letter written by Arthur to
Millie, who was visiting her aunt in Santaquin,
Utah, near Provo at the time, indicates this fact:--

Feb, 17, 1902
My Dear Millie:

Your kind and welcome letter of the 13th was
received, and I can assure you that it was read
with pleasure. I just came from meeting. They
dedicated the new building today (Training School),

The President of the Church, Joseph F. Smith,
and a number ofthe Apostles were down. There
is going to be a Grand Ball tonight but I do not
think I will go as Iam so weak it is hard for me

to get around, Sorensons have it that I have the
diphtheria down here and that I got it from you.

I dare not go up to Cornelias (Sorenson) anymore
as Imight give them the diphtheria (ha ha),
Edmund Sanders is down here, he said that nearly
all the flags are taken down in Gunnison. (Quaran-
tine flags for diphtheria.) It looks like storm here
now - makes me feel quite lonesome for I'm all
alone,

"Well dear, I guess if you cannot speak
above a whisper you cannot talk to me from where
you are, You must write soon and let me know
when you are going home, You must not think
that it was staying up late that made me sick, for
I think it is the warm weather. Did you have a
good time at the dance? I did not say I was out
until morning Saturday night, Did I not say Friday
night? And that was the night I was down to Broad-
bent's with you. You know I got lost there by the
grove and then got stuck in the mud and had to wait
until it was light before I could get out, Louis
bought John Wasden's place so I guess he will be
my neighbor now, I am going to stay here until
Saturday or Sunday and if I am not better by that
time I will board the train for home,

"Katie went home Saturday for the wedding
of Bell and Erick - I suppose you know Otto and
Jennette are married, Wish Iwas in Santaquin -
would make your Aunt Lizzie, as you call her,
wait a long time if she was going to wait up for
you, Well dearest, write soon and then the next
time I write you I will know for sure when Iam
going home, From your owntrue, Arthur, 333
East 5th North St, Provo, Utah. (Old David
Jones home, }'' Then Arthur added a hand drawn
sketch of a bird flying with a heart in its mouth,
on which he wrote the words ''Love to Millie. '!

Millie's and Arthur's courtship led to
marriage, Millie's sister remembers this:--
"When Arthur and Millie were married they went
to the Manti Temple, Wed. 3 Feb. 1904. Millie

turned twenty-two twenty-three days later. She
was nearly five months older than Arthur, A
wedding reception was held that night at our home
and, as was the custom, a big dinner was served
to all the guests, The couple first lived in a small
house two doors east of Grandpa and Grandma
Christensen's but, when mother died not too much
later, they moved west into our home so that Millie
could help care for father and us younger Gledhill
children,"

Grandmother Christensen often had her own
troubles, Tresia remembers that at one time she
and grandfather had gone to a show at the Opera
House there in Gunnison, Upon returning home in
the dark, by the Co-op store, she ran into a tie
post and cut her forehead and a bad infection set
in, which they called Erysipelas, This was an
acute infectious disease of the skin or mucous
membranes, caused by some kind of streptococcus
and was accompanied by inflamation and fever.
Grandmother had quite a time of it. At another
period she was afflicted with some sort of stomach
trouble and couldn't stand to drink either water or
milk, nor could she digest her food without much
distress and pain, She lived for months eating
nothing much but clabbered milk, or ''thick milk"
as she called it. At another time she injured her
foot so that she could not bear her weight upon it,
But she kept right on working around the house,
moving back and forth kneeling with one leg ona
chair. It seems she seldom gave in to pain or self
pity, though she was the soul of pity for others who
suffered,

Greater pain is usually caused by seeing
ones own children or loved ones suffer or by seeing
them indulge themselves in practices that are
harmful or degrading to them, When children are
young, a mother can say ''no''to them and it can
mean the same as her saying "I love you", for they
must be taught self-discipline and of course child-
hood is the place to begin this training. As children
grow older, parents can seldom teach or govern
them by saying ''no!" But life is like a mirror and
children grow to adulthood with the lessons of their

childhood reflected in their adult lives, I never
remember seeing any of my Christensen uncles or
my father smoking, nor did my grandfather Chris-
tensen use the harmful and obnoxious weed, Of
course the gentler sex never smoked in those days,
as far as I know. But most of the boys must have
tried it at one time or another for that seemed to
be the thing to do, In Albert's recollections he
tells of his 'try'':-- 'Some of my group - I cannot
remember their names - were trying to imitate
the older boys they knew who smoked. I somehow
thought I would try this experiment so I bought a
sack of Bull Durham and a package of cigarette
paper and proceeded home with the intention of
learning the art. Somehow I didn't even think of
hiding it from my mother, who was working about
the house and yard, I did remember that she had
said in my hearing that she hoped her boys would
never be seen with a cigar in their mouths, Well,
when I was in the act of rolling my first cigarette
my mother came along and observed what I was
about to do, The look on her face was so sad that
it startled me. She said, ''Albert, are you going
to smoke?'' Tears came to her eyes and she :
turned away. The look on her face struck me with
shocking force. I took the Durham and the paper
and threw them into the irrigation ditch. Mother
never mentioned the subject thereafter but I never.
thought of smoking again,"

Pearl remembers her father Chris telling
about his experience with smoking:-- "Being out
with the sheep so much he had taken up the habit
of smoking, One day he ran out of smokes and the
craving for one became so intense he could hardly
bear it. He was alone in the mountains far from
any other place or sheep-camp and could not leave
his own herd, He said he felt he would go mad if
he couldn't have a smoke, Then he thought of the
dying campfire - perhaps he could find the unused
butt of one in that! Quickly he knelt down by the
heap of ashes and began pawing frantically through
them in search of a cigarette butt. All of a sudden,
in his mind's eye, he stood up and viewed himself
as he crouched there groveling around in the ashes
and soot like a wild animal, Utterly ashamed, he
got up from his knees and vowed then and there
<span id="page-??"></span>

that from that time forward he would never again
be a slave and stoop to such a filthy habit. And
he never smoked again, '! .

There was often music at the Christensens.
Elsie and Emma had each taken some musical
instruction at Snow College and again at B. Y. A.
Laurs had bought a piano for the home, and both
the older girls played it quite well, especially
Elsie. Vena also taught herself to play a little.
Louis and Arthur learned to chord on the piano
and the banjo. Both of them also had good voices,
as the older girls did, but especially Lou. Tresia
remembers when the two boys sang in the ward
choir together there in Gunnison, Pearl remem-
bers that her father often sang at his work and
what a very good voice he had, though it was
untrained, Grandma Else usually sang or hummed
at her work, her rich contralto softly keeping time
with her beating or stirring, as she moved from
table to stove in the process of her cooking, or
with the movement of her body as she scrubbed the
dirty clothes up and down on the washboard.
Always she hummed at her weaving and quilting,
sewing and knitting, Often she sang in Danish what
must have been ''King Christian''or "There is a
Lovely Land'. But she sang hymns too in her own
special English. I can still hear in memory one of
her favorites, as she used to sing and hum it inter-
mittently:-- "Guide us Oh Thou Great Jehovah. , ,
Guide us to the Promised Land, , , We are weak
but thou art able, hold us with thy powerful hand. . ,
When the earth begins to tremble, bid our fearful
thoughts be still. . . When thy judgment spreads
destruction, keep us safe on Zions hill. . . Holy
Spirit. . . feed us till the Savior comes. , . Great
Redeemer, . . Bring, O bring, the welcome day.'"!
Grandmother used V's for W's, T's for D's, D's
for T's and Y's for J's in her own special brand of
English - and how I loved to hear her sing or speak
as she did with such fervor, Grandfather appreciated
music too, but I think he loved to dance to it more
than sing. Intruth, all the Christensens enjoyed
music, President David O. McKay once refered to
good music as a power that ''gentles the human
animal", Might we not call it the rainbow that
bridges earth with heaven?
<span id="page-??"></span>

It was perhaps in midsummer of 1904 that
the son Andrew left for more advanced study in
Europe. Laurs and Else must have been extremely
excited about this for he planned to visit their rela-
tives in Denmark first, before going to enroll for
classes in Germany. Else in particular must have
loaded him down with the addresses of her people
and ''many loving greetings" to give them, as well
as plenty of advice about the necessity of gathering
as much genealogical information as possible while
he visited in Jutland. He was, of course, urged to
call on his father's brother Christen and his two
daughters, his wife now being dead. But in ali
instances he must have been cautioned not to men-
tion the Gospel in an outright manner lest he offend
his Lutheran relatives and wear out his welcome
oversoon, Andrew B. arrived in Jutland, Denmark
as scheduled and was welcomed with much warmth
by his Danish kin, especially Else's people with
whom he spent a number of happy days. They were
much impressed with their nephew and cousin
"Anders", as they cailed him, if the reports in
their letters back to Laurs and Else were any
indication. But Andrew's advanced study in
Germany that followed did not fare as well, for
it was unexpectedly interrupted.

Andrew had left Sarah and the three children,
seven-and-a-half year old Adelbert, four year old
Edith and one year old Wendell, comfortably situ-
ated in a rented home in Prove, Utah. Edith tells
of this in her own history:-- 'Mother was living in
Provo, Utah. Two of her younger sisters, Mary
and Rose Bartholomew, were staying with us while
attending B. Y. U. Father had returned to Europe
for further study. In late November, 1904, snow
covered the ground and it was cold, Adelbert fell
ill with diphtheria and was isclated, I soon suc-
cumbed to the same disease but was given the anti-
toxin which helped turn the tide in my favor, When
I began to recover I asked to see my brother
Adelbert. He was my dearest playmate and, being
about three-and-a-half years older, was also
something of a champion and defender to me.

They toid me that Adelbert had been taken away.
No, he would not be back, He died 29 Nov. 1904
and was buried in the Provo cemetery. Grief and

the feeling of utter loss can come to a four year
old, I felt bereft and sobered. I had loved this
older brother with all the tanacity of my little soul.
The feeling lasted for years. Father, of course,
broke off his studies and returned from Europe
immediately following the news of Adelbert's
passing. He came home to comfort his saddened
family."

Electricity hadn't come to Gunnison by June
1907, which was the time Elsie and Alma moved
from Fayette into the beautiful new red brick house
there that they had purchased from the sheepman,
Lafe Bown. Most everyone used the common coal-
oil or kerosene lamps for lighting and there seldom
seemed enough to supply each room, There was a
need then for the large center table upon which
stood the parlor lamp, filled with coal-oil, its
chimney freshly cleaned, sending out a glow of
light round which family members flocked at nights,
like moths to a flame, If lamps were scarce they
were carried from room to room as needed, like
the times when President Wilford Woodruff used
to visit Bishop Bartholomew's home in Fayette,
when the children were small, as told by Mrs.
Henry Bartholomew as she heard it from Roxie:--
"President Wilford Woodruff was a favorite visitor
at our home, especially with the children, Com-
pany always slept upstairs where, if the weather
demanded, a nice fire would be built in a little iron
stove. But there were never lamps enough to go
around to allow the visitor to keep one in his or
her room all night. When President Woodruff was
there and had retired upstairs to his room with one
of the few lamps, the children would wait and listen
until they heard him start to snore, then they would
say to the Bishop, 'Father, now you can go up and
get the lamp.' Then father would be very cautious
as he approached the stairs and when a big snore
would come he would jump back, saying, 'Do you
think there is a bear upstairs?! And how the chiid-
ren would laugh - 'Do it again, ' they'd coax,"
Incandescent lamps fed by gas were acquired by
some homes and business places throughout Gunni-
son Valley however. Such lamps with glass chande-
liers were in each of the seven rooms of the James
Bown home in Gunnison when that family moved into
<span id="page-??"></span>

it in Sept. 1900. Quite likely Elsie's and Alma's
new red brick home also had such ones when they
moved in. Gas lamps, at five or six intersections
along Gunnison Main Street, were lowered each
evening and lit with a torch by the town marshal,

He was usually accompanied by a group of children.
Early each morning the gas lights were extinguished.
The lamplighting era wasn't really over in Gunnison
until about 1912. ;

Who of us can remember the old black kitchen
stoves with their long stovepipes, that had to be
"blacked" and polished every so often with stove
blacking or soot-black, and who can remember the
stove brushes, stove lifters, stove lids, stove
irons, stove shakers and stove pokers that went
along with them? I dare say few of us have ever.
had to empty ashes from the ashboxes into the ash-
cans or onto the ash piles that cluttered up the back
dooryard of every dwelling. Few of us have been.
required to remove the clinkers from the stove
grates with the stove tongs or carry a stove shovel
full of hot coals from a hot to a cold stove to start
a fire when matches were scarce, much less to |
borrow coals from the neighbors, Does anyone
now remember the black old stove rag chucked |
behind every kitchen stove, the coal skuttle and
woodbox sitting beside that always seemed to need
filling, and the hot water reservoir on the further
side of the best kitchen stoves which always seemed
to need refilling too? Who recalls the let-down
oven doors which all clamored to "sit on first" to
warm themselves on cold mornings when their
teeth were chattering, and the cozy places behind
by the chimneys that were always shared by the
cats? Have all now forgotten when the bottoms of
all cooking pots and kettles were soot-black and
had to be scoured clean with every washing, and
when dish rags and dish towels never quite came
clean of black even with two sudsings and as many
boilings? Likely there are few indeed who can
remember the "smoking stoves"! that sent all
coughing to the open doors for fresh air and which
blackened curtains and walls, or the "belching ©
stoves'' that threw soot and ashes all over every-
thing. But some can, Yes, those were ''the good
old days!"

A family reunion was planned in honor of
grandfather Laurs' sixtieth birthday, which was
July 22, 1907. All of his living descendants
gathered at the old home in Gunnison for that
occasion and those from out of town stayed over
for July 24th as well. Most of the children, with
their families, lived nearby: Chris and Caroline
and their four girls and two boys were just a few
blocks away; Joseph and Roxie with their two boys
and one girl were a bit closer; Elsie and Alma
with their four boys were settled in their new home,
which was also within a few blocks of Laurs' and
Else's; Emma and Charles came from their ranch
a mile east of town with one child of each kind -
but they were expecting another; Louis and Florence
came from the ranch they lived on west of town with
their one daughter and two sons; Arthur and Millie
too lived close to the old home with their two little
boys, the second hardly three months old, the
youngest of the crowd. Albert and Jennie drove
down from Manti with their two girls and two boys,
the last boy not quite five months old. Andrew and
Sarah with one daughter and two sons had the
farthest to come since they lived in Salt Lake City
and likely took the train down, Vena was of course
at home, and being still single was expected, we
suppose, to help with all the extra work brought on
by a gathering of this kind, Tresia, though of
course invited, was working in Salt Lake City and
could not get away. What a happy gathering this
must have been - forty-six wonderful people in one
big family, with a good showing of males to carry
on the Christensen name, each of the six Christen-
sen sons having two living sons apiece,

Chris was then overseer of all the herds of
the Julius Christensen estate and had some herds
of his own, There was good money then in sheep.
Lou and Arthur were working with Chris, taking
care of some of the herds, Andrew was Principal
of the L. D. S, High School in Salt Lake City.
Joseph was Principal of the Gunnison District
School and Bishop of the Gunnison Ward as well.
Albert was a successful practicing attorney in
Manti and had his eye on a judgeship. The two
older girls were successfully married, Elsie to
a sheepman and Emma to a farmer and rancher.

The ever-loving Vena was always a great help in
her parent's home and also in the homes of her
brothers and sisters whenever needed. Truly these
were sons and daughters to be proud of.

Andrew's and Sarah's Edith (Edythe) has
such happy rememberings of this and other holiday
occasions, when their family returned to Gunnison
when she was a child:-- "I recall wonderful family
reunions at the old Christensen homestead in
Gunnison among our beloved grandparents, the
erect, aristocratic-looking Laurs Mathias and the
stately patrician-in-homespun Else Kathrine, and
the families of relatives, Their welcome seemed
so genuine - with no exceptions, Grandmother C's
welcome came straight from the heart, It was
honest and all-enveloping! Anything she had was
'yours for the asking'. The uncles would either
proudly or shyly ask questions and tell us of many
things, The aunts, less reticent, took us into their
hearts and arms, They then proceeded to 'kill the
fatted calf! or poultry; to bake unbelievably light
breads, rolls and cakes; pick the choicest produce
from their garden and bring out their special pride
in pickles, jellies and jams, Ice was brought from
the sawdust and a large freezer of ice cream was _
on the way. Need I give the amount of thick jersey
cream and the number of fresh eggs that were ©
poured into these makings? Oh, these were the
times of feasting, visiting and comparing notes
for the adults; and for the children, a never-to-be-
forgotten opportunity with cousins, more cousins. -
and double cousins, If the events resulted ina
family group picture by a professional, as it did
during at least two of these reunions, we today are
all most grateful to have such records of those
choice gatherings,"

A photographer had been arranged for to
take a group picture of the entire family during
this reunion, and all were lined up in due time on
the sidewalk in front of the home. Chairs were
placed for Laurs and Else and the married women.
Rugs were spread in front for some of the children
while others sat or leaned on their mothers, Pearl,
Elora, Harold and Aunt Vena stood up in back with
the men, some of whom were holding little ones.
<span id="page-??"></span>

I remember how long it seemed to take before
everyone was arranged just so, and how hot the

sun was, Some children kept squirming around as
the photographer, under his black camera cover,
tried to adjust his equipment. Other children ran
here and there and had to be constantly brought
back. The ground where I sat was so hard it was
difficult to find a comfortable way of sitting. I put
my legs out straight in front of me and mother
Jennie said, ''Sit with crossed legs dear, like

your cousins,'' Itried for a time but got tired - so
put my knees up. Mother said, ''Put your legs
down dear, it isn't nice to sit like that.'' I put my
legs down. ''Why can't Elaine and I change places?'!
I complained. ''Why does she have to sit on a chair
with the big people?'' I might have known this was
the only way they could keep her in tow, Sherman
kept pulling off his starched cap and father kept
putting it back on his head - Dad was so proud of
that little Buster Brown suit mother had made |
from "Indian Head", Mother had a brush and
every time I squirmed she smoothed down my hair
with it. I was so envious of Ruth Ellen's ringlets,
tied up with a bow, and Edith's long ribbon-tied
braids - not a hair out of place! Byron kept reach-
ing over and pulling LaFaun's long crimped hair
until Aunt Emma slapped his hands, A, Owen kept
whining for a drink until the other children took up
the refrain and Aunt Vena went and brought a dipper-
ful of water from the well and each took a sip, as
far as it went - "Don't dare drink too much" Aunt
Elsie warned sharply! Several tries were made
but every time the picture-taking-man went to snap,
some child made a dash out of the lineup. Grand-
father had to hold Melrose down between his knees
to keep him from running. At last, when all
seemed serene and ready and the big moment had
come, the photographer held up his hand and pre-
pared to shoot and we were about to be taken, when
it was discovered that Elmer and Roy were missing -
there they were up in the tree! How that photograph
ever turned out so well I'll never know, for only
grandmother looked frazzled in it, although most
of the others must have felt that way before the end,
And guess what? Iwas caught with my knees up -
Wouldn't: you know it?

The folks had a dozen or more copies of the
picture made, one for each family and some extras
to send to their dear relations in Denmark for
Christmas that year, That their Danish kinfolk
received and appreciated the same is indicated in
this translation of two letters received by the folks
later, one from grandmother's sister Stine and one
from Stine's husband, Svend Poulsen:--

"Monday Evening, 27 Jan. 1908
"Dear Sister Else:

"T will tonight try to write a letter to you,
our dear family, thanking you very much for the
picture you sent us, It is really fun to see so
many people on one piece of paper, Yes, all the
little faces, how pretty they are - allofthem. It
is so much fun to see "Sotter Anders", as the ,
children say. Yes him we have seen in person
you know and liked him at once - yes he won all
of us! It would make us happy to see him among
us again, Maybe some of his sisters and brothers
will come sometime, but I guess you ''Old Ones" |
won't come, It is sad that you dear sister should
be so far away from us, Now soon eighteen years
have gone by since you visited us. I am much
better now than when you were here, I thought
just now that if it were now that you had come, I
could really be happy. But thanks because you —
made the trip before, it was glorious to see. you —
then and it was such a strenuous trip, It is good
to know you have been strong and had good health,
this is one of the great blessings in life. Next
Oct, 12th I will turn sixty years old’and I guess
you are about two years older, if I remember
right, It isn't much I am getting written for my
husband is sitting here on my right and is also
busy writing to you. We have sometimes said if
we could just get to know the date of your husband's
birthday then we would surprise him with a greeting.
We hear from him so often and on the picture he
looks very good, We wish it was clearer of you.
but it is not easy to get so many on such a little
space, Again thanks for the picture and thanks
because you write to the folks in Thorsted, then
we also hear of you through them, But now when
you get our new address, we hope you will write
<span id="page-??"></span>

to us sometime. Love to you all from your sister,

Ane Kirstine Andersen
(Stine Poulsen)'!

"Dear Brother in Law and Family

"T also bring you thanks for the picture you
sent us. Is it not strange that the number of
people increase so much? When we look at the
picture we realize that where there were about
forty years ago only two people, now there are
forty-six. Yes, yes, a half dozen strangers have
come into the family but in spite of that it is still
strange that the number has grown so large so
fast, The best thing about it all is that they look

of the many children and grandchildren will ever
come to Little Denmark, the birthplace of the two

over here, It is often now you know that people
from the Far West visit Europe - even Denmark

family ‘are so fond of, I don't know if he will see .

him thanks because he has been so friendly as to
come and visit us for some days here in Denmark,
It would make us happy if he would write us a letter
andtell us about his stay in Europe after he left us,
if he had any profit out of his trip and stay in the
famous. places. It would also be very pleasant to
hear what he is doing, if he is‘a teacher for a
group of young folks or if he writes books,

Yes, as Svend Poulsen had said, things were
changing, and this was true in Gunnison Valley.
In about 1907 the cream separator had been intro-
duced there, Before that all milk had been skimmed
by hand, except for the time when in one household
the milk pans had been skimmed off for several |
mornings and no one could tell how or by whom,
But everyone was being blamed until someone
chanced to go to the cellar at dusk one evening
and there found a blow-snake of immense size
daintily siphoning off the precious cream. , . In
May 1900 the Bell Telephone Company had run a
toll line through Sanpete and Sevier, The poles
through Gunnison had been set down the middle of
Main Street, The town had subscribed for one

telephone, which was installed in a shop-residence,
When a call came in a messenger was sent to bring
the person wanted to the telephone. In 1907 Leo
Gledhill, Millie's older brother, had improved on
this by building a one circuit line in Gunnison, with
signal ringing. Using a combination of short and
long signals each subscriber did his own ringing
and every ring came in loud and clear on every
phone. But this system was also unsatisfactory
and Mr. Gledhill was appointed to work out a
bigger, better telephone service, and so in 1909
the Gunnison Telephone Company was organized,
with a magneto switchboard being installed on the
second floor of the postoffice and operated by Mary
Gledhill. Forty telephones were installed that year
with rates 50¢ per month for residents and $1, 00
for businesses, one being installed in the home

of Gunnison's new Mayor, Joseph Christensen, . .
Familiar sights in Gunnison before 1910 were the
water barrel wagons making their rounds carrying
that good tasting drinking water from Peacock
Springs southeast of Sterling, to the many customers
in Gunnison; for Gunnison drinking water in general
tasted soterrible. When, in 1909, Centerfield and
Mayfield were incorporated as towns and Gunnison
became a third class city, the first big project of
Gunnison City Council, under Mayor Joseph Chris-
tensen, was to purchase the Peacock Springs and
have the water piped to Gunnison. Trenches were
dug, pipes laid, and water made available to all
the homes there by 1910. , . And there were
seasons in those early years of the new century
when the mice were so plentiful and playful that

it took a truly brave man to stand up before the
pulpit and address the congregation. Many a hero
had the actual experience of having a mouse
scamper up and down his trouser leg. In those
days, so it has been said, the closing prayers in
church meetings, unlike the long drawn-out ones
of before, were short and streamlined and some-
times ended with "Amen, I caught 'im', Believe
it or not, Uncle Joseph Christensen must have
been among the brave then, since he presided as.

5. DESTINY TAKES A HAND

'  Laurs and Else, freed from most of the
responsibilities of their big family, began to go |
more often to the temple. Else had kept up a
fitful correspondence with her kinfolk in Denmark
since her return from there and Laurs had written
to them also, He liked to write letters much better
than Else and was a good penman. In spite of the
fact that they usually requested some genealogical
information when they wrote, little came back to
them. Andrew had brought back some bits of data
gleaned while he was there but it was little enough.
The urge to know more of their relatives, especially
their dead, was always with them, The death of
an aunt here - an uncle there - a-cousin married -
a niece or nephew born - everything of the sort was
set down quickly in their joint Temple Record Book
as a source and reminder of future work to be
taken care of in the temples of the Most High,

Only those who have truly experienced the Spirit
of Elijah can appreciate what these records of |
their kindred meant to them, . The first part of
the year 1907 they had spent a great deal of time
in the Manti Temple finishing the ordinance work
for all of their dead whose records they had. _
Temple work was the work to which they both now
wished to dedicate the remainder of their lives, —
aside from the precious time they would spend oo
with their ever-increasing offspring.

They didn't remain living in Gunnison long
enough to enjoy good spring water tapped into
their home there, nor did they stay long enough
to have a telephone put in, According to the early
Gunnison Ward records their church memberships
were removed to Manti, Utah 15 Feb, 1909.: ‘It
seems, however, that before settling in Manti
they spent some time living in Salt Lake City and
working in the temple there, perhaps at their son.
Andrew's suggestion, since he and his family were
living there then, It has been said that they lived:
some west of the temple down below the viaduct at
the time. Eventually, however, they settled in
Manti in a fair sized adobe house on the corner of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Destiny Takes a Hand 376

what is now First North and First East Streets,
Besides the house there was a barn on the place
with room for a horse and a cow or two, also
plenty of room for a few pigs, lambs, chickens,
geese, a garden and some berry bushes on the lot.
But the most important thing about it all was the
fact that it was within easy walking distance of the
beautiful Manti Temple.

But then a plan was born - or perhaps it
came to mind while they were rummaging through
their important papers earlier, preparing to move,
Could it have been that Laurs happened upon his
blessing given him in Christenburg in 1884 and
took time to re-read it? Likely. Much that had
been promised him at the time had come to pass
and. much was promised for the distant future,

"Ja, Ja, all this is wonderful and fine, '' he must
have thought. . . ''Your life shall be spared long
upon the earth", , . "Ja, Ja!'' But it was the part
that came next that must have bothered him and
set his mind to working on it. .. ''The still small
voice will say to you - 'Go back to your native land
where you Shall bear witness of the Gospel for your
relatives and friends, both the high and the low.
You shall do many works in their midst, as the
Angels of the Lord shall prepare the way and the
wisdom of the Holy Ghost be given you. . ."

Now how could he himself just ignore this part of
his blessing and expect the continued blessings of
heaven?

Else must have readily agreed that Laurs
should return to the Old Country and also that she
herself should return with him, since she still had
so little of her own genealogy. There would never
again be a better time for them for they were not
getting any younger! But what about money? They
would talk to the boys, perhaps some of them could
help a little with that since most were doing well.
And perhaps Louis and Florence would buy their
Gunnison place instead of just.renting it as they
were doing. Vena could of course stay with Emma,
who was so in need of help now. Thus Laurs and
Else had talked and planned and the immediate
future took on a glow of anticipation, But when they
spoke to Andrew about it he encouraged them to wait
<span id="page-??"></span>

yet another year, for he had also been making plans
to return to Europe and take up the studies that had
been interrupted by Adelbert's death. This time

he wanted to take his family along, and it would be
better to wait until their new little daughter, Elsie
Eliza, was a little older and thus better able to
travel, If they themselves would wait another

year, they could all go over together!

Laurs and Else pondered Andrew's advice
and decided to wait. Then Else wrote the exciting
news to her loved ones in Jutland, for she could
not keep it, and Laurs wrote to them also and to
his brother Christen, -- Oh that they two should
meet once again in this life! It didn't take long at
all for letters to come back from some of Else's
loved ones, all in the same envelope, and she and
Laurs read them aloud to each other in Danish, as
they were written, and rejoiced for they knew they
would see the writers in person 'ere long, Follow-
ing are translations of these letters:

'Thorsted, Denmark
15 April 1909
"Dear sister and family:--

Thank you very much for your letter, it was
a great joy to all of us. But I will admit that I feel
a little ashamed because I haven't written for so
long. Ihave often thought about it. Yes, dear
sister, I, like you, pray for us Old Ones and the
Young Ones too and thank the good Lord our Father
for all his gracrious gifts to us. It is almost more
than I can believe that you can take that long journey
again, but may it be a successful one and know that
here will be joy and that we will take care of you
as well as we can. We still live in our home,
Mikkel is well and can go about both home and out-
side and the same is true of me, We have Fred-
erick, Maren and Holger home and those who are
out are doing fine too, We don't have as many
grandchildren as you but we only have two who are
married so it is understandable that we are in
lesser number, Jens has nine healthy children
and Kristian one who is two years old, Yes, when
you get to Thorsted you can visit all of your family.
Sister Marie and brother Lars are fine but I guess
they will write. I am sending a view of sister

Destiny Takes a Hand 378

Stine's home at the time Anders was here in Den-
mark, He visited Svend and Stine in Vinding by
Vejle. As you know their daughter Signe was
married to the Principal of the High School, but

he died last summer so she sold the school and
has bought our old house. Svend was here in
March to buy a piece of land. We expect him any
day now. He will build their new house himself
you know. Stine will stay at Signe's place till the
house is finished, Svend shall then stay with us in
the meantime, Their lot is not more than five
minutes walk from our house so believe me Stine
and I are looking forward to living so close to each
other. Dear sister, we don't have much to com-
plain about reading your writing but it may be hard
for youto read mine, You said that it was the time
for sowing when you wrote. Here it is different for
after having a mild winter now we have had three
days of heavy snowing and today the men have been
out shoveling snow to get the road passable, This
is something none of us ever remember having
happened before right in the middle of April - but
it will do much good anyway. It is good to have a
sure leader to trust in so we have reason to be
happy children,

Yes, dear friends, I must close for it is
always a hard task for me to write and for that I
am sorry Since there is an old saying which goes,
'If you make me happy. you make me good', and I
know we can make each other happy by writing.
But when we meet and talk together that will be
even better, Tell Anders Hello for us Old Ones
and the Young Ones too, Those were happy days
we had when he was here. Yes, how time goes
by - it,is now five years ago soon, But how happy
we are: for your picture. We have to search long
to find a family as big and nice as this one! With
this I will say goodby and God's peace with us all,
your sister - Karen,'"'!

"Dear Relatives Far Away:

"Mother has now written and asks me to send
a little greeting too, I thought that she probably
had told everything so that there was no news left
for me to tell. It is too bad that my dear cousin

379 Destiny Takes a Hand

Elvena cannot read my letters for then it would be
her rather than you that I wrote to. Dear Aunt, if
it really should come true that you will visit us
next Summer how happy we will be! We will treat
you as good as we can in every way - but cannot
cousin Elvena come with you? I think it would be
nice for you too if she did and we would look for-
ward to that very much, You write that she just
turned twenty-two. I turned twenty-five on the
second of April. This must be the time we cele-
brate birthdays, Tell dear, good Anders ‘hello!
for us many times and congratulate him on his
little children, Wasn't it his oldest son who passed
away? Dear friends, if it just hadn't been so far
between us then maybe there could have been a
possibility for me to visit you for I still have a
desire to get out, really out and try and see what
I can amount to. Maybe my opportunity will come
someday. Mother is well - she can do things her-
self, Father will turn seventy-four on the first of
September, He has good health too so I should
really take the opportunity to get away now,
Receive, all of you, the most loving greetings
from your niece and cousin - Maren Skaarup.

Tornely, Den. 17 Apr. 1909"

"Dear Aunt Else: ,

"Now that mother is planning on writing you
I would like to send along some word too. Yes,
you must come next summer for sure, and couldn't
Elvena come too? You say that youa re thinking of
letting your son Louis have your home in Gunnison,
then I guess Elvena could come with you and you
could close the house you have now. Uncle Svend's
family is up here in Thy now. As you know, they
are going to live out at Thorsted. Ihave been
working in an embroidery shop in Thisted for
fifteen months, I finished my apprenticeship in
January and have been working for wages since.
I shall now, this May, go to Salling High School
for the months of May, June and July as a student
and to help with sewing classes at the school. The
pay is 40 Kr, besides the tuition,

this summer which will start in May. It said in

the paper about a month ago that they would have
to work both nights and holidays to get ready by
then. Be sure and tell Anders 'hello' for me.
Maybe he can hardly remember me as you know
Iwas small and not yet confirmed when he was
here, I am now a good sixteen years old. I guess
you will let me hear from you before you come so
I will write the return address on the letter as
plainly as Ican. Iam enclosing a picture of
myself which I would like cousin Elvena to have -
it is the last [had taken. I am sewing much so I
shall have all my clothes ready for school as we
have been unable to get a serving girl. Mother
tells me so often about Aunt Else so I know you
well although I have never seen you. Now I will
close with many greetings of love to all the many
cousins but mostly to Elvena, Anders and you two
dear Old Ones, From your niece, Edel Christen-
sen, Tornely, Thisted, Denmark."

'"Dear Sister Else, husband and children:

"Now that my daughter Edel has written
such a long letter I will just add thanks for your
letter which we were so happy to receive and for
the hope it awakened in us of seeing you again
once more inthis life. Yes dear sister, we
would all be so happy if you and your husband
would risk the trip again, I guess it is I now who
am the Old One for I am not very well as my
weight is so high. Iam 2001bs. and my legs are
bad since I suffer from vericose veins, However
summer is the best time for me, Tell Anders
'Hello', we all remember him with great warmth.
Tell all of your other loved ones and your husband
the same also but receive for yourself a big and
loving greeting from my husband and me - Marie,"

As it turned out Laurs and Else were probably
thankful that they had waited and not gone back to
the land of their ancestors that year, for it was a
period of births and deaths, happiness and sorrow-
ing for members of their family and they were on
hand to share in both. It started out in February
of that year when Arthur, a twin himself, was pre-
sented with twin girls by his wife Millie. But let
the oldest of these, Cousin Grace, tell the story:--
<span id="page-??"></span>
381 Destiny Takes a Hand

"Dr, Hagan bumped his head on the hanging kero-
sine lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and
me, for I was there and heard the bang! Our
parents were proud and happy with their enlarged
family - four children under the age of four. Then
too, the way things happened was quite the talk
around town, I was born about twenty minutes
before midnight on Feb. 16th 1909 and Gladys
was born about twenty minutes after midnight on
Feb. 17th - twins born on different days. This
was quite a drain on mother's health and so it
was decided that Aunt Vena Christensen should
take me and Aunt Mary Gledhill should take
Gladys, until mother regained her strength."
Aunt Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) now well past eighty,
continues the story:-- 'When Grace and Gladys
were born Grace, a large blond Christensen baby,
came first, not long before midnight. About two
hours later, not long after midnight, Gladys, a
tiny, sickly, dark complexioned baby that looked
like the Gledhills, came. Millie, in her hysteria,
refused to own the second baby. Dr, Hagan put
her in my charge - they didn't expect the little
thing to live. I cared for Gladys in my room at
home where I fed her with an eye dropper for two
weeks, a mixture of whisky and something else
the doctor put with it, which probably helped to
save her life." ;

Though Dr, Hagan delivered the majority of
babies now in Gunnison, you could bet if a new one
was arriving at any of the Christensen's homes,
either grandmother Else K,, Aunt Vena or both
would be right there to help out, before and after,
And a number of other babies were expected by
the Christensens within the year. Arthur's and
Millie's twins weren't a dozen days old when
Joseph and Roxie had another child at their place,
the seventh, but only the fourth to live. This one
was a big, long, hungry baby and Roxie had far
too little milk to satisfy him. So every few hours
Someone took him over to his Aunt Millie's for an
extra breast nursing, since she had plenty for the
twins and some to spare for Virgil. Not to be
outdone then, Chris and Caroline brought forth
their seventh child and third son, Farrald, the
very first part of that September, And a month
<span id="page-??"></span>
Destiny Takes a Hand 382

and a few days after Farrald arrived, Louis and
Florence had their fifth child, the first baby to be
born in the old Gunnison homestead since Vena,

as far as we know, Little brown-eyed Dale helped
to compensate for the loss of baby Spencer, who
had been laid away by Louis and Florence some
seventeen months earlier. Thus five more grand-
children were quickly added to Laurs' and Else's
posterity - jewels in their crowns! Else K. at
least was most likely present to greet each one on
arrival.

But - ''The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh
away. ..'! On Sat, 18 Dec, 1909 Elsie's and
Alma's little son Byard died, He was thena
beautiful child of four years nine months and
sixteen days, but had always had an incurable
heart condition. Alma was on the desert with the
sheep at the time and Elsie was expecting again
soon. She and grandmother were alone with the
little one when he passed away. His burial was
delayed until Alma could be notified and return
to Gunnison. On Wednesday afternoon, two days
before Christmas, a brief funeral service was
held at the residence, Thus over a happy home
the shadow of a little grave fell, But exactly
seven weeks later Elsie had a beautiful baby girl
to fillher empty arms. This Edith was so wel-
come, not alone because of her little brother's
passing but also because she was the first daugh-
ter, following four sons.

Emma and Charles had also known much
sorrow in the past two years, having lost two
baby daughters in stillbirth, one right after the
other. Neither were named, Their oldest daugh-
ter Ada, though quite young at the time, says she
distinctly remembers the last of these little ones
in her box-casket lying there perfectly formed like
a beautiful doll, She just couldn't understand why
this baby sister wouldn't wake up - she so much
wanted a little sister to play with for she had only
Byron. Charles buried each of the little corpses
on their ranch there, across the wash some dis-
tance from the house, But then Ada got a real live
sister when Emma gave birth to a healthy baby
girl, 13 Jan. 1910, who later received the name
Imelda.
<span id="page-??"></span>
383 Destiny Takes a Hand

A few years‘before, Andrew and Sarah had
purchased a lovely home in Salt Lake City on 27th
South and 9th East, The story went that it had
been built by President John Taylor, so Edythe
says, and she continues:-- ''The house was of
brick, with an artistic front porch and roof from:
which jutted dormer windows, The glass of the
front parlor window was of good dimension with an
upper panel of colored glass, The home was of
two stories. A couple of the upstairs bedrooms
had windows facing the west from which we could
watch the sunsets with their colored reflections
upon Great Salt Lake, as well as the snow-capped
mountains of the Ochre (Oquirrh?) range in
winters. The annual fireworks displays of old
Wandemere Park were exciting delights on July ©
Fourth and Twenty-Fourth nights. It was like
having reserved seats to the very best shows,

"The grounds were extensive, Many homes
have since been built upon the area that was then
our lot. Fruit trees of all varieties, raspberries,
strawberries, and different kinds of currants grew
abundantly. There was much gardenspace. The
property even boasted a windmill but this father
took down to avoid the danger of having it crash >
onto the roof in a.strong wind. A big stream of
water gushed from a pipe on the property, but
whether its source was froma spring or an >
artesian well Ido not know. Father envisioned
our own fish pond and proceeded to have one.
excavated, lined with cement and stocked with an
abundance of trout. It was later protected witha
high mesh fence when the second daughter of the
family, Elsie Eliza, came along; for from the
time she could toddle she was fascinated with this
pond, The fence had a padlocked gate to permit
easy entrance to the pond when necessary.

"Sometime later, in fact Friday 8 April 1910,
my two younger brothers and I were hard bent on
‘jumping the rope’, It was the rage at school and
Wendell and I hoped to perfect our form. We were
down in the orchard some distance from the house.
Mother had commissioned us to watch out for
seventeen-month-old Elsie who had also come out
of doors to play, but was not with us. We had
<span id="page-??"></span>
Destiny Takes a Hand 384

looked toward the fish pond and the gate appeared
closed so we looked no further, After a time
mother called from the back door, 'Have you seen
Elsie?' The rope was thrown down and we
scattered to search. J] reached the pond. The gate
was now ajar, apparently it had been pushed closed
but not locked. There, peacefully floating on the
water, baby face to the sky, was our little sister.
I was quickened and stunned with remorse - why
hadn't I gone out to the gate and really checked -
why hadn't I watched more closely and kept the
baby with us? I wrestled with myself and even yet,
after all these years, I feel responsible for that
tragedy. A small funeral service was held in our
parlor a few days later and Elsie was buried in the
family plot at the Provo City Cemetery beside our
brother Adelbert, I never 'jumped the rope' again,
nor could I even bear to watch the school groups
jumping the rest of that spring, ''

Nevertheless this was not the end of the grief
for the Christensens, I remember it as if it were
yesterday. We, Albert and Jennie and family, lived
in the John Maiben home in Manti which we were
renting while our new house was being finished,
our old one having been sold. Elaine and I had
just returned from Sunday School, it being Sunday
22 May 1910. We found mother in the parlor,
accompanying herself on the organ and singing that
very old hymn, ''Who are those arrayed in white,
brighter than the noonday sun, , ,'' At least these
were the words she was singing, if not the title of
the song. Father was out of town on court business.
A messenger came to the door - Father was wanted
on the community telephone, long distance. Mother
went to take the call - she seemed worried, She
came back in a few minutes, tears streaming down
her face. Cousin Orilla, Chris! and Caroline's
daughter Elaine's age had just passed away with
scarlet fever, Others of their children were down
sick with it also. The funeral would not be held
until they could get word to Uncle Chris who was
up on ''The Weber'', They would let us know later.
Five days after, Friday 27 May, about the same
time of day as Sunday, mother was again seated at
the organ playing and singing ''Who are those
arrayed in white. , .'', when a girl from the
<span id="page-??"></span>
385 Destiny Takes a Hand

telephone office came the second time to call
mother to the telephone - long distance, ‘It must
be word about the funeral' she said as she went
out, Soon she returned almost beside herself
with weeping. ''Poor Chris - poor Caroline", I
remember her sobbing; ''Elora too has passed
away with scarlet fever !'"'

Uncle Chris returned home just before Elora
died but there had been nothing he or anyone else
could do to save her, Joint funeral services were
planned for the two sweet little girls, and since
the family was in quarantine for this dreaded
disease, aS were numerous other families in the
town, the services were held outside in front of
the Christensen residence, Pearl remembers
that her two younger sisters were dressed all in
white for their burials and that for the funeral
their caskets were lifted outside and propped up
on one end so that the beautiful corpses, thirteen
year old Elora with her long, waist-length blonde
hair hanging over her shoulders, and seven-and-
a-half year old Orilla with her golden curls, could
be more easily viewed by the mourners on the
sidewalk, Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) remembers
that the neighbor children and young people, her-
self among them, gathered and sat on the ditchbank
across the road north to watch the sad proceedings,
for these lovely girls had been friends of theirs.
All were weeping.

everything - even the little string was so fun. To
think that you dear sister had tied around it all!
Yes, Ican surely see that you have lost weight,
but believe me I am far from a small thing - so
big and fat! But I can move and if I didn't have
these difficult legs I could tumble around well yet.
But they are whole even if they are tired of the big
weight and vein knots, Otherwise Iam fine and
healthy if I can just avoid cold weather, Sol
would rather move into the city to live and get rid
of the garden, My husband is striving with it at
this time, planting potatoes, carrots, chervil,
radishes, peas and onions, We are behind compared
to you but they go along too, those who are behind,
Yes, we would be so happy to see you so come as
soon as you can! Now you can visit all four of us
in one day, Svend and family live in a nice house
in Thorsted. He will also put ina garden, I
believe that sister Karen and Mikkel are thinking
of giving the farm to some of their children but it
won't likely be until next spring. Brother Mads'
wife Else has been sick again this winter with
stomach trouble and a weak lung. She is up a little
now but looks terrible. They have their Edel at
home but this May their daughter Marie is coming
home from Sjaelland where she has been for many
years, then Edel will go to High School.

"IT guess my Edel will write you. She is
home this month but is leaving again in May, She
would be glad if she could see the much-talked-of
Aunt Else, When she was younger she wanted to
go over to see you she said. Now that the family
have all seen your letter we will begin now to
answer so that you shall not miss getting word
before you leave. Edel will write, and here with
the most loving greetings to you, Christian, Anders

"Dear Sister:

"As Iam staying with sister Marie at pre-

think we will get to send a letter this time. At
this time of year Svend is quite busy and he is
taking a trip ina few days. But Icantell you

"Dear friends in the distance:

To you dear sister, first we shall say thanks
for your long letter. It is delightful hearing from
you but when we have the wonderful joy of seeing
you then will it be much more delightful. I can
tell you that we are all well and have it good,
Mikkel is still running the farm but it probably
will be only one more year. He'll shortly be an
old man for in September he will be seventy-five.
But he is well and he gets around, away and at
home, and that do we all. So we have so much to
thank the good God Father for - yes his grace for
us is more than we can comprehend. I know to
begin with that I won't write as long a letter as
you, dear sister, Brother Mads' wife is very
sick and has been that way for a long time so we
don't know if she is going to be here very long,
But it all stands in God Father's hands, and since
theyzely on this it shouldn't be as hard on us
friends as long as what happens is God's will.

We have sent your letter back to Marie so don't
have your new address but hope your old one will
find you. Iam supposed to say ‘hello' from Svend
and Stine, we are happy that they came to Thorsted.
I will close with many loving greetings to you all.

could never leave our good Denmark,

6. SOME DREAMS COME TRUE

In Salt Lake City, Andrew, doubtless thinking
it best to get Sarah and the children away from the
scene of their recent tragedy, resigned his position
as Principal of the L. D. S, High School and con-
tinued his plans to take them all to Europe that
summer of 1910, Sarah and the three children,
putting aside their grief for brighter things as
best they could, took on a project to help, as
Edythe relates:-- ''To raise extra money, mother
took a strawberry patch in East Millcreek, on con-
signment, We drove out early and picked berries
every other morning through the bearing season,
then sold them dewy-fresh with heaped-up cups, "'

Though this must have been a difficult
decision, Andrew and Sarah finally decided to sell
their promising place there in order to finance the
trip as well as his advanced schooling in Europe.
Learning that Chris had decided to leave Gunnison
and settle Caroline and the children in Salt Lake
where they would be nearer ''The Weber" and his
work, Andrew approached his older brother on the
subject. Edythe writes of this also:-- 'Our home
was sold to father's older brother, the wonderful
Chris I, I have been told by his daughter Pearl,
that her parents had already decided to purchase
another Salt Lake home before father approached
them with the need to sell, His family changed
their plans as an accommodation to us. I hope,
however, that they felt some of the joy that we
had in the old place,"

Laurs and Else and Andrew and his family
left for Europe that midsummer of 1910, but as
things happened they didn't travel there together
after all. Laurs and Else made arrangements to
travel with some L, D. S. missionaries, '"'3
Klasse", while Andrew and family went a little
earlier in July and doubtless had better accommo-
dations, Again we turn to Edythe's history for the
details of their travel then:-- ''Father, mother,
Wendell age 7, Sheldon age 4, and I age 10, left
in early July for Europe, Father's parents were
to meet us later in Denmark, to visit among the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Dreams Come True 390

relatives there. Wherever we went, father always
‘put himself out' to give us all the cultural and
educational experiences he could - bless him! We
traveled first by train to Montreal, Canada, The
fortress-like city of Quebec was also a stopover,
In each place sites pertinent to early colonial
history were visited and the events explained in
bright detail. Our ship was of the White Star
Line, We cruised along the St. Lawrence River
to its mouth, then into the rough Atlantic. After
one meal or two mother, Sheldon and I were con-
fined to our quarters for the duration of the voyage.
Father and Wendell were not at all affected by the
sickness-of-the-sea, nor did they hesitate to boast
of it.

"Many others had been ill enroute and so it
was in part a pretty peaked-looking group that
docked on that one particular afternoon at Liver-
pool, England, where we were soon taken to a
modest hotel in time for a late 'tea'. This con-
sisted of a platter of thinly sliced white bread
spread with sweet imported Danish butter to go
with our glasses of milk, In no time the rounds
of bread disappeared - they had the taste of
ambrosia to us, The serving woman almost
despaired of filling up 'those Americans', By
morning a 'milk strike' was on and from our hotel
windows we heard the clatter of horse-drawn carts
and witnessed cans of the precious white liquid
being dumped out on the streets,

"We then journeyed to London for a few days
Sightseeing, taking in many worthwhile things such
as the British Museum, Christopher Wren's hand-
somely designed Church of St, Paul, and West-
minster Abbey, etc., and then went on to Oxford.
Here we were settled in a large, comfortable and
clean upstairs sittingroom, which served also as
a dining room and partial bedroom, with another
small bedroom adjoining, And there was a precious
English garden enclosed by a wall, at the rear of
the house, The place was owned by two spinster
sisters who insisted on marketing, cooking and
washing up. The tasteful English food was served
in covered dishes delivered to our door each meal-
time, with the necessary plates and silver. No

shopping for groceries - no cooking - no washing
dishes! Imagine the wave of luxury that came over
our hard-working mother and how she blossomed
into increased loveliness under this release from
care,

"Father enrolled at Christs College - one of
the many in that educational city of renown, There
were few afternoons following his classes that he
did not take us through some part of the venerable
quaintness of Old Oxford: Green lawns stretching
everywhere with trees and shrubs in abundance,
leaves just turning their color, and a profusion of
flowers that fairly took our breaths away; a lazy
river winding its way through, on which we some-
times rowed; parks inhabited by bushy-tailed
squirrels and small tame deer; horse-drawn
streetcars on which we occaSionally rode; inter-
esting and quaint shops, book stalls and stores,
collectors dreams, in which we often browsed;
and old, sometimes crumbling vine-covered
churches whose musty-smelling doors were always
open and into which we never failed to enter, ''

In the meantime, back in Zion, Laurs and
Else were ready to leave for Denmark at last,
They had secured and thoroughly investigated
literature and instructions pertaining to a journey
of this kind,

Passports were not required to secure
admission to Denmark, but they were useful or
necessary as a means of identification, or in proof
of citizenship. They should be exhibited wherever
evidence of citizenship was required, Since Laurs
had never served in the military in Denmark, and
although he was now far too old for such service
and besides had been a naturalized American
citizen for well over thirty years, having declared
his intentions to become one 2nd Aug. 1875, in the
First Judicial District Court of the United States
in Provo, Utah, still he had no mind to take any
chances in Old Denmark, So he applied for and
secured his passport, which came with the follow-
ing ''NOTICE: The person to whom this passport
is issued is hereby directed to affix his signature
<span id="page-??"></span>
Dreams Come True 392

thereon, in the space designated, immediately upon
its receipt... etc... etc. . . American citizens
who expect to make a prolonged stay in any foreign
country should apply for consular registration to

the American Consulate in that country. ..

P. C. Knox - Dept. of State, Washington, April 11,
1910.'' Else of course had her passport from before,

The couple had arranged to travel from Salt
Lake City with a group of Europe-bound mission-
aries, two of whom were going to Denmark, Elders
John Elmer Larsen of Tabor, Canada, and Hans
Sanders of Salt Lake City. They had received their
letters of instructions which read as follows:--
"INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITORS WHO ACCOMPANY
THE EUROPEAN PARTY LEAVING JULY 13th. .
Your train leaves Oregon Shortline Depot 5:15 p.m,
Wednesday:-- The Oregon Short Line Ry. to Ogden;
the Union Pacific Ry. to Omaha, the Chicago Great
Western Ry. Omaha to Chicago, Your rail ticket
is all in one ticket for the entire party between Salt
Lake and Chicago, and is held by the Elder in charge
of the company. If you have a trunk to check you
should be at the Oregon Short Line depot baggage
room not later than 4 p.m. Wednesday. The Elder
in charge has an order to get your rail ticket from
Chicago to Montreal that is paid for, and you hold
your own steamship ticket, The large new steamer
"Megantic' that you go on, sails from Montreal at
daybreak Saturday the 23rd, and passengers sleep
on board the steamer the night before, Liverpool
address; Durham House, 295 Edge Lane, Liverpool,
England,"

Else had procured a smali notebook in which
she copied addresses, any genealogical information
she happened across, and a sort of day by day
account of their travels, and from this we copy:--
"Left our home in Manti on the 9th of July (1910);
left Salt Lake City on the 13th; came to Omaha on
the 15th; came to Chicago on the 16th; left there
on the 17th July; came to Buffalo on the 18th;
came to Montreal, Canada on the 19th of July,
going on the ship the evening of the 22nd July."
This was Laurs' sixty-third birthday and he may
have recalled the last time he was in Canada,
which was exactly forty-four years before, when
<span id="page-??"></span>
393 Dreams Come True

they rode the abominable cattle cars on their way

to Zion in 1866 as newly arrived Danish emigrants,
In fact it was in Montreal that they had first boarded
those filthy boxcars, Laurs had spent his nineteenth
birthday those many years ago crossing over from
Canada into the United States. Who would have
dreamed then that he would return again to Montreal?
Neither could they know now that the day before,

21 July 1910, brother Mads' dear wife Else had
passed away in Denmark, The two sisters-in-law
named Else would never meet again in this life, or
would Laurs ever meet Mads' wife, as he'd
expected, but the others of his wife's kin by the
grace of heaven he would soon see - and also
Christen, his only living full brother! Can we
imagine the stirring of his emotions as he thought
upon these meetings?

Now continuing Else's account of their
journey:-- 'We started to sail the morning of the
23rd July, on the ship S. S. Megantic; came to
Liverpool 30 July; crossed over from England to
Grimby on the lst of August on the ship Vicaria;
came to Esbjerg on the west coast of Jutland on
the 3rd of August in the morning; came to Thisted
the same day in the afternoon.'' Here at Thisted
they must have been met by some of Else's folks |
from nearby Thorsted, perhaps Mikkel Skaarup,
who had come for Else before. .And when they
had come to the village of Thorsted perhaps the
flags were flying again to greet them, for this
was the Danish way to celebrate, And what a
family reunion and festival that must have been, |
though surely somewhat tempered by the grief
that still clung to them because of Mads' wife's
passing. And what wonderful days those must
have been that followed, with all four sisters,
their companions and brother Mads together,
along with all the nieces and nephews who could
manage to be there for the welcoming of their
Aunt Else and Uncle Laurs from America. That
"Uncle Laurs" fit right in with the crowd can well
be imagined, for with his good natured disposition,
kindliness and rare diplomacy, not to mention his
ever ready Danish wit, he must have won them all
over, both the Old Ones and the young.

But Laurs and Else were not the only ones
from the Mormon state who were traveling to Den-
- mark at the time. President Joseph F. Smith, ‘his
wife and son and Presiding Bishop Charles W,
Nibley, his wife and two daughters, had arrived
in Copenhagen July 27th and were in the process
of visiting many of the various branches in the
Mission, including the one at Aalborg. They were
being accompanied by Andrew Jenson, then Presi-
dent of the Mission. These brethren from Zion
spoke to capacity audiences wherever they visited
and Brother Jenson showed slides and pictures of
outstanding places in Mormondom, It was a most
successful missionary venture on the part of these
brethren, according to former Church Historian,
Andrew Jenson, and the Danish and Norwegian
newspapers published many favorable comments
on the same, although there were others who railed
against them, This was said to be the first time in
history that either a President or a Presiding
Bishop of the L. D, S. Church had visited in _
Scandinavia. :

The publicity given these L. D. S, Authorities
doubtless made it somewhat easier for Laurs, in
his kind way, to try and open up friendly conversa-
tions on the subject of religion, as if the way had
been paved by a higher power. Nevertheless, even
though Jutland Danes were seldom silent and usually
began each sentence with a "Ja" or a 'Nej" and
ended each question with an ''eh'') yet when the
Gospel and its principles were mentioned there
were never any "Jas", '"Nejs!'-or "ehs'', only
silence. So how in the world could Laurs, Else
or anyone else tell what was on their minds then?

It was a bit discouraging to the would-be missionaries,

Yet the welcome given the two by Else's
people was warm and sincere in every other respect;
and who can say no sparks of truth were lighted
there? © After a few days of it in Thorsted, Laurs
and Else were on their way again, going south
from Thisted by train to visit numbers of other ©
relatives, as Else wrote in her notebook:-- ''Came
to Hurup on 9th Aug. to Salmon Sorensen's my
brother Mads' daughter Valborg's place; came to
Christen ''Flarups" the 10th of Aug. A.M, at
<span id="page-??"></span>
395 Dreams Come True

Nessum by Hurup.'' Christen Flarup was the name
they called Laurs' brother Christen Christensen,
but whether it was merely a nickname or whether
he had assumed this name by then we know not.

So it was here that the two brothers were reunited
after forty-four years of separation, but whether
this, their last meeting on earth, was all Laurs
had hoped for aside from the aspect of religion,

we are uncertain, As far as the Gospel was con-
cerned, however, we have been told that his
mission here was unsuccessful, for Christen
would have none of it! But strange as it may seem,
one of his two daughters later joined the L, D. S,
Church there in Denmark, according to Aunt Sarah
Christensen's understanding,

Genealogical gatherings were interspersed
among the travel entries in Eise's notebook, and
according to these they must have visited relatives
in Kjallerup, where she was born; Hvidbjerg
Western, where she was christened a Lutheran;
Bedsted (Bested) where she was baptized a Mor-
mon; Kobberod where grandfather Laurs was born;
Gettrup where his mother was born, and other
places dear to their youths, Even though Else's
"day-by-day'' account does not list these places,
her genealogical gleanings jotted down at the time
do, After two days spent with Laurs' brother
Christen, they parted from him and went on their
way as follows;-- ''Going to Laurs' cousins,
Thomas (Nielsen) Wies from Nessum the 12th of
Aug.; today the 19th Aug. evening - we are here
in Tolbol with my cousin, Sidsel Marie Hvid
(Madsen) and family; today is the 5th of Sept. -

We are at the home of Mr, Svend Kirkagade;

today is the 8th Sept. - we are now in Skive with
Laurs' cousin, Peter Kvisgaard Poulsen (wife and
one child), at 2 o'clock we will go on the water to
Hvalpsund on the way to Nibe.'' Laurs made some
notes of his own regarding this part of their journey
in a small memorandum book, in this manner:--
"From Struer 9:22, In Skive 10:32 (here lives a
son of Jens Kr. Poulsen, railroad assistant P,
Poulsen, ) From Skive with motorboat to Hvalpsund;
In Nibe 6:39 - in Nibe lives Jens Kr, Poulsen's
daughter-in-law, flower trader (florist), Signe
Poulsen, from there to Grydsted School,"
<span id="page-??"></span>
Dreams Come True 396

We continue Else's account:-- ''Going to
Aalborg 17th Sept. 1910, We are here in Aalborg
17th Sept, in this good home with some loving
Saints, Christen Pedersen and wife Kirstine
Marie; Mrs, Marie Carlsen, 679 E, Jensen Ave.,
Salt Lake City, her father and mother live here in
Aalborg - we must see them here and also go to
L. D. S. Church headquarters here in Aalborg, at
Borupsgade 12. Going back to Thisted tomorrow,
In Aarhus the 20 Sept. in the home of Peter Forge-
sen Fisher, father and mother of Willardsen's
wife Marie of Centerfield - also had word from
her Aunt Anne, 'Kobenhaven'' 30 Sept. 1910, will
see Hans Mortensen's girls here today."

So it seems Laurs and Else traveled from
one end of Little Denmark to the other visiting their
relatives, both close and distant, and also calling
on relatives of friends back in Zion; and as they
traveled to and fro the list of names and vital
statistics of families they visited enroute grew
and grew in Else's notebook, Sometime during
their journey Else contacted a professional
genealogist by the name of Jens C, Nielsen, and
engaged him to search out the records of her noble
progenitors, the Hvids - way back, Perhaps this
was one of the things that took them to Copenhagen
then as well as their desire to visit the L, D. S,
headquarters there and greet mission president,
Andrew Jenson, whom they had known so weil
since they traveled together on "Old Kenilworth",

Here one now saw ten bicycles to every motor-
car and at noons or days ends the ratio was higher.
Old-fashioned church gables still zigzagged on the
sky, where they stood with their red tile roofs,
high white walls, and copings bright around them
like red ruffles, Perhaps Laurs and Else stood
with all the people in the public square there and
sang ''There is a Lovely Land", as the band played
it. It was more popular with the Danes then than
"King Christian'’, They had added a new verse to
it lately, something about ''Denmark shall never
fall as long as there are blue waters lapping on
the shores of her green islands.'' But in spite of
all the ''new'' this homeland of theirs would always
be old, for even before the fierce old Vikings there
had been a Denmark!
<span id="page-??"></span>
397 Dreams Come True

Then Laurs and Else must have written
Andrew and Sarah at 81 Coroly (or Corohy) road,
Oxford, England (the address was in Else's note-
book) to inform them that they would be returning
to Thisted in Jutland the forepart of October and
to meet them there then, and, according to cousin
Ehythe's history, this is what Andrew and his
family did:-- 'Sometime in late fall we left the
idyll of Oxford for the province of Thisted, Den-
mark - home of our paternal ancestors, The route
was via the North Sea. It was only an over-night
trip but, from the moment movement began in the
hold of the ship until sometime after landing, I
experienced the sensation of having my head lifted
from my body, then of being woosily dropped from
a very high place, Again, mother, Sheldon and I
took to our beds and stayed there, From the port
of landing we traveled by train and ferry. The
ferry boats were usually constructed with railway
ties and holds sufficient to load the train intact on
the boat, passengers and all, ferry it across and
then release the train to speed on its way until the
process was repeated again.

"We found father's parents with the relatives,
as per schedule, Idon't know how much genealogy
had been accumulated by Grandfather and Grand-
mother but all attempts to interest the relatives in
the Gospel were foiled. They were adament. The
"red carpet'' was extended and kept bright as long
as ''Mormonism!'' was kept under cover. We were
dined and plied with extra refreshments until
mother finally cried "halt!" She could take no
more rich pastries nor cream thickened hot choco-
late (substitute for coffee), and pled for watered-
down milk and plain crusts of bread.

"At last relatives and our beloved grand-
parents were bidden a fond adieu as father headed
his little family toward Germany and school, From
Copenhagen we went by water to Hamburg, then by
train to the capitol, Berlin. Kaiser Wilhelm II was
then in his prime. Father arranged a visit to the
Berlin palace and a parade of the Kaiser's goose-
stepping troops - the elite guard - in review.

These fairly gleamed in their bright uniformed,
white-gloved spit and polish. At the entrance of
<span id="page-??"></span>

the palace we took off our shoes, tied.on flannel
substitutes, and were guided over polished floors.
that shone as mirrors, reflecting the crystal-
studded chandeliers as well as the many mirrored
panels that slit the hardwood or taspestry bedecked
walls. (The Emperor's ambitious glory was to be
short-lived however, from then on,) From here,
again by train, we reached our destination - the
fine old University city of Leipsig."

Possibly one of Laurs and Else's last acts
before they bid a last farewell to her people and
left Thisted for their home in America was to visit
once more the village of Norhaa and one of the
spots most dear to Else's heart. We have reason
to believe that they found the dwelling where she
once lived in ruins, The churchyard cemetery
where her parents were buried must have been
visited as well, which must have called up fondest
memories of her childhood and youth, together
with a feeling of deep emotion at the thoughts of
never being able to visit there again, But let Else
herself tell of some of her feelings then, for she
put them in verse, (These verses have undoubtedly
lost much in translation from the Danish but we
have done the best we could. )

"O Denmark, O Denmark, thou art my Birthland

Now long years have vanished since I saw your strand.

Here stood father's dwelling near the lake's wooded
shore . . .

But now it is gone - we shall see it no more,

"© here was our garden with mother's flower bed
But I see not the rose that once bloomed so red
And gone is the bench where Rudolph and I ,
Sat and listened so oft to the nightengale's cry.

"In Old Denmark here have I yet family,
Therefore I came back just for them to see
And I offer a prayer on this far-away strand
That someday they'll follow me to Zion's land,

"A wreath have I laid on this dear hallowed ground |
On this grave where my mother in death was laid down.
Then farewell to.all who hold her name dear,
For ship's bells are calling - we shall meet no
more here, '! --Else K. Christensen

In Thisted they secured a ''Haandbog for 3
Klasse'' from one P. Andersen, and then it was
back to Copenhagen for them again, by train and
ferry. Here they mailed a few letters of thanks
back to their loved ones in Jutland and sent along
a few gifts of money to the nieces who had been so
helpful during their visit. Then they sailed away
from Old Denmark and her green islands about
mid-October 1910, on one of the big ocean liners
owned by the ''Scandinavian-Amerika Linie', This
should have been a fine trip for Laurs and Else
since neither of them ever suffered from seasick-
ness, having been raised to the lullaby rhythm of
the sound of the sea, However, th: y were plagued
by a shortage of money, doubtless having overspent
a bit "putting on airs'' in Denmark that they could
hardly afford; though it must have been well worth
it to be able to impress their kinfolk there. If
Else was inclined to fret about it Laurs probably —
smoothed things over with a shrug and some com-
ment such as:-- ''Well, better to be poor and right
than to be poor and wrong", having in mind their
Danish relatives utter lack of interest in the
Gospel, as well as their modest circumstances,

It took nine days to cross over and, upon
docking in New York City, the two found it nec-
essary to telegraph home for additional money
with which to continue their westward journey.
While they waited, uncertain about the outcome,
they likely busied themselves writing cards and
letters, not only to their many children but to
their Danish loved ones as well to let them know
of their safe arrival inthe U. S, A., and probably
adding a postscript about being found financially
embarrassed in New York, and of course making
a joke of it. But it must have been no joke to be
found so, Cousin Byron Peterson remembers his
mother, Emma, telling about receiving an urgent
request for help from her stranded parents in New
York, and of hurrying down to the Gunnison tele-
graph office to wire them some money. In her
haste, however, Emma stumbled and fell in the

Returning to their own state the last of that
October, Laurs and Else must have viewed with joy
the Rocky Mountains and all the other familiar
sights and sounds that said "this is home", They
must have stopped off a few days to visit Chris and
family in Salt Lake City, for there was so much to
tell! Then they must have hurried back to Manti
in time to cast their vote, for it was important to
them to assist in electing representatives who
would support Republican President William Howard
Taft. Elvena, Albert and family would have been
on hand to greet them at Manti, where they had just
moved into Albert's and Jennie's lovely new home
there on Depot Street (now 195 West Ist North).
Previously that fall, while the new house was being
finished, Vena had been taking care of three of
Albert's children in Old Man Henry's rock house
next door, while Jennie had been at her father,
Joseph Snow's house, quarantined in with Elaine
there, she having taken scarlet fever, Remember-
ing Chris and Caroline's sad loss of that spring,
Jennie and Albert had taken no chances with this
dreaded disease. Albert, Judge of the Seventh
Judicial District, had been staying at the hotel
when he could be in Manti, but now they were ail
settled and together again; and Vena was happy to
have her parents back so they could all get settled
again too,

Letters from Denmark were awaiting Laurs
and Else upon their return - it was good to know
that they were fondly remembered in Thorsted:--

"Thorsted, Oct, 24, 1910
"Dear Aunt and Uncle:

"Greetings from Denmark! Then you are

for your land far away. I guess it has to be like
that - but we can hear from each other, Receive

missed you so much the first few days, I almost
believe it was because of the dear little children
who kept me so busy. I wonder how things are
for them in Germany? And you, Dear Uncle,
with your good humor which you have preserved
throughout all the many years you have lived over
there - yes and preserved the language too,
Thanks for what you sent me. I will buy some-

"Yesterday I took a trip by bike out to Aunt
Maries, I brought greetings to her from your
letter, She said she was longing so dearly to get
to know when you were coming back here to live -
or so she said, Oh but I get tired of her ways for
so often she talks so much and it is not always
wisdom that she speaks it seems to me. I believe
that Aunt Else will understand what Imean, I
hope you are well on the ship - I wonder how far
you are right now? I know that wherever you are
you have a dome-shaped sky above you.

"Dear Aunt, when Iam sitting all alone, as

now at this moment, so many thoughts and ques-

tions come to me. I often feel like him who said
' 'The good things I intend to do Ido not but the evil
I didn't intend to do, Ido', Yes, we are all weak

all is spoiled for us - everything must be given us

28 Oct, 1910

"Dear Friends in the Distance:

"Thanks very much for the letter, it came in
good condition, We hope that when these few words
reach you that you are back in your daily routine |
again and safely home. Now you have a lot to
think about since you have been in so many different
homes recently, There are so many impressions
to be received through travel, Here we are very
thankful that all went so well while you were away.
You asked, dear sister, how goes it with the
Skaarups? It was so strange that you should ask,
especially at this time during Mikkel's dark
period (illness), Trouble is not something unknown
to me, but I must thank the good God Father for
both the light and the dark and for everything we
lack, I know for certain that we do not always
thrive best with wind (under good circumstances),

I could just about say that the only wish I have is
that Mikkel, and all of us, could be free of our ail-
ments but we must admit that, as Paul says, 'we
have a thorn inthe flesh'. Ihope you, dear sister,
can understand my thoughts, I can truthfully say
that Mikkel has been a good husband, and a good
father to all of our children, But I can tell that we
are getting older and we sometimes have to have
things hard to get us to be humble and make us
like little.children for our God Father, who both
can and will help us. I am so grateful at least

that my leg is better.

"Day before yesterday we had the threshers
here. You should have seen the bunch of grain we
had. Brother Mads was here to help. I promised
to send you a greeting from him and also one from
Svend Poulsen. Stine is not yet completely moved

"Dear Aunt and Family:

"I feel it's my duty to protest against Marie's
coverage of me concerning my inner personality
because there she plainly exaggerates to a high
degree. The judgment she gives is such that it is
dependent upon the eyes with which it is seen and
I don't believe that her sight is completely unob-

cure her but will leave it to time who doctors all
mistakes, it is said.

"I have a friend of my youth among the Mor-

If so I would appreciate it if you would say ‘hello’

So, they wouldn't talk about religion when
Laurs and Else were there - but they could write
about it now when there was less chance for
rebuttal! Perhaps then they had set their Danish
kinfolk to thinking, after all, Who then could say
that no seed of truth had been sown among them
there?

7, PROPHECIES FULFILLED

"The Master Artist who molded the Wasatch
Mountains surrounding Sanpete Valley must have
loved beauty and put an extra measure of it in his
work that day. He made those mountains high and
strong and rugged. He remembered to garment
them with blue pine forests, with groves of slim,
graceful aspen and scarlet maple patches, He
strung crystal ribbons of water along their arms
and pinned white columbines and bluebells high
upon their grassy heads. In the midst of this
beauteous creation He carved out a ''Bishops
Chair" or a "Queens Throne", As He tapered them
off near Manti He purposely left a mound of ivory
stone jutting out into the valley. Many days and
seasons covered the stone mound with the gray
alkali dust of the valley bottom, A few scrub cedars
and pine crept out of the lower canyons and stood
upon the plain gray hill; because from its summit
they could see the whole valley.

"One day a young Nephite came to the valley
purposely to visit the small gray hill, He stood
very quietly upon its crest, The hill felt the
warmth and power of his magnetic person for he
was a Prophet of God! His fair hair shown gold in
the sunlight and his face was serene with the spirit
of revelation, This Prophet, Moroni, knelt and
brushed the dust from off the hill's face and with-
drew a chip of white limestone, He smiled happily
as he examined it. Then he bowed his head in
<span id="page-??"></span>
405 Prophecies Fulfilled

prayer and dedicated the hill to become a home of
a sacred temple of God.

"Years passed, Seasons of eternal snows
and thawing winds swept the hillside. A few more
cedars came out of the deep canyons to keep watch.
Only the red-men visited the gray hill. Centuries
of waiting followed, but these did not darken the
gray hill's memory of the Nephite prophet's visit
nor of its own glorious destiny. . . And again it
was November - a crisp Indian summer day. The
gray hill, wide-eyed with wonder, saw in the
distance a caravan of strange people approaching.
White-topped wagons wormed their way across the
valley and drew halt under the very foot of the
plain gray hill - and here they made their camp.
When all were asleep late that night the cold
breath of winter came out of the west, turning the
enchanting colors of autumn to withered blackness
much as fire would char. Everything in the valley
became covered by an ermine blanket of snow and
lay cold and white - everything except the watchful
green cedars on the gray hill, Next day the people
went to the gray hill and dug out warm homes for
the whimpering children and purple-lipped women.
The happy hill felt the comfort of these pioneers
within it.

"Winter waned and days began to lengthen
and warm. The hill became worried and fretful
for it knew that when spring came thousands of
rattlesnakes would crawl from its crevices and
challenge the dugout homes of the pioneers, and
it was helpless to give aid. It could only hide its
ugly, muddy face and bear the humiliation. Would
the gray hill's promised destiny never be fulfilled.
then? Yet, when the dreadful day came, these
men and women valiantly met the challenge of the
poisonous fangs and slew the snakes by the hundreds.
No one was bitten or injured, But ‘ere long the
redmen came to torment and kill and the pioneers
found their dugout homes insufficient protection,
The gray hill could help this time, for she gave
the stone needed to build a strong fort that saved
many lives when Chief Blackhawk was on the
warpath,

"In spite of all, the pioneer colony grew and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Prophecies Fulfilled 406

the gray hill supplied stone for new homes for new
people. But with all the new scenes and changes
the hill remembered the Nephite dedication, Then
it was spring again and today this memory was
especially vivid. Springtime always brought new
hope. Today was April 25, 1877, and the mountain
air was filled with wild flower fragrance and mating
songs of the birds, A gentle night rain had washed
the valley to sparkling brightness. The warm morn-
ing sun called from out the earth its verdant green
carpet and spread it wide, as if to welcome a noble-
man's coming; and today the gray hill felt the foot-
steps of another Prophet of God.

"Tt listened as the Prophet Brigham Young
told his companion, Warren S, Snow, 'Here is the
spot where the Prophet Moroni stood and dedicated
this piece of land for a temple site and that is the
reason why the location is made here and we can't
move it from this spot; and if you and I are the only
persons that come here at high noon today we will
dedicate this ground', Five days later construction
began and soon the temple started to grow like an
exquisite white flower from out the depths of the
hill, Eleven more years the gray hill waited to see
the Manti. Temple finished and its delicate towers
patterned against the sky, Then, at the glorious
sight of it, the heart of the hill burst wide open with
joy and let forth a flow of clear, pure spring water
so that lawns, trees, shrubbery and flowers could
be watered to thrifty growth,."'

The ''Plain Gray Hill" referred to in Florence
N, Bagnal's beautiful story was anything but plain
and gray when Laurs and Else Christensen, our
beloved grandparents, took up their temple work
in real earnest the beginning of the second decade
of the twentieth century in Manti. Then Temple
Hill, rich in tradition, stood green and bright and
crowned with a majestic temple of God; fulfilling
its sacred destiny, as the prophets of old had
foretold, And here to this Hill and this Temple
the aging couple went faithfully and often, as
brother Joseph Hatten Carpenter, Manti Temple
Recorder for some forty years tells:-- '. . ,
Laurs M, Christensen and his good wife, your
grandparents, lived in Gunnison for many years.
<span id="page-??"></span>
407 Prophecies Fulfilled

When I was working in the temple they moved to
Manti and spent their remaining years by coming
almost daily to the temple, Your grandmother had
quite a record of her kindred she labored for, Your
grandfather worked considerably on my record. I
hired him and paid him, as his own record was ©
completed to the extent he had it. Your grand-
mother was a very intelligent woman, and was
anxious that her children should have good
educations, , ,"!

Yes indeed, Laurs and Else K. went often
to the temple now, At first they walked the four
or five blocks or so to and from their home there,
Later they took the horse-drawn temple hack both
ways. Grandmother eventually received numerous
records of her ancient relatives on the Hvid line
sent from Denmark by the researcher she had
engaged on her last trip there, They each did all
the work they could for their dead. They also
solicited the help of some of their sons and daugh-
ters in this work, and even involved some of their
grandchildren in doing baptisms for their dead. It
was the custom for many years for Sanpete Valley
children to be allowed the privilege of going to the
Manti temple, on or soon after their eighth birth-
days, to have their own baptisms in the beautiful
font there, Until the practice was discontinued
and other places provided, Grandmother Else
took the responsibility of seeing that most of
her grandchildren who lived in the area during her
time had the opportunity to go there for that pur-
pose, Pearl, the oldest grandchild, writes of
this:-- "I was baptized at the age of eight years.
Grandma Christensen took my two cousins, Harold
Christensen and Leo Nelson and myself to the
Manti temple for the occasion, Afterwards she
took us up the spiral stairway into the top of the »
temple and told us to always remember the things
we saw and heard there, I shall never forget
them. Grandma also took me there several times
later to be baptized for the dead.'' Most of the
grandchildren thus favored got to climb up the
winding stairway, as cousins Pearl and Harold
did, and as I did, to the very tip-top of the temple's
west tower, for a breathtaking view out over the
valley; and a number of them were taken by
<span id="page-??"></span>
Prophecies Fulfilled 408

grandmother to the temple again at various times,
as Pearl and I were, to be baptized for some of our
Danish relatives of long ago.

Nevertheless Laurs and Else didn't bury
themselves in temple work entirely but succeeded
in doing some of the other things they enjoyed, Else
especially loved to visit her friends - and she had a
host of them. In earlier days she went by horse |
and buggy. Crystal Snow Witbeck remembers when
"Sister Else Christensen used to stop in at Sterling
on her way back and forth from Manti to Gunnison,
to visit my mother, Anne Marie Nielsen Snow, and
get a 'cold glass of buttermilk', Father, Franklin
Snow, would unhitch her horse and water it in the
creek by which we lived and feed and care for the
animal while the two dear friends chatted away in
Danish, perhaps for hours, Oh the unusual exper-
iences your grandmother could tell about the olden
days in Denmark; I wish I could remember some of
those stories today.'"'

Grandmother Else not only visited all around
Sanpete Valley but in Salt Lake and other places and
it seemed that everywhere she went she found
friends to talk to. As she progressed in years she
abandoned the horse and buggy and took to the train
for her visits, On one of her various visits she
may have been bragging a little overmuch about
her ''wonderful children" and the fine marriages
they had made - you know how proud mothers are
sometimes, when they get to going on about their
offspring, and Else K, was no exception. Well,
on this particular occasion a certain sister so-and-
so, whom she was visiting, being perhaps a bit
jealous or at least hoping to take her friend Else
"down a peg or two", finally got in her say, -- 'Ja,
Ja, but Vena you vil haf alvays vit you!'' You see
Elvena was getting on in years and not yet wed,

Some of Laurs' and Else's greatest joys in
later years came from visiting their children and
their families. Cousin Byron remembers that his
grandparents often came from their home in Manti
to visit at their home east of Gunnison, ''At first
they came by horse and buggy,'' said Byron, "and
whenever we saw Grandma coming we'd go out and
kill a big fat hen, for we knew she'd want to make
<span id="page-??"></span>
409 Prophecies Fulfilled

Danish soup and dumplings right off. Father raised
pigs for the market, sometimes fifty or more at a
time, and occasionally when grandpa and grandma
came to our house grandma would ask if we had a
'runty pig', referring of course to a baby pig who
wasn't doing very well, She prefered the ones
with curly tails. Father always seemed to have

a 'runty pig' when grandma paid us a visit and she
just seemed to have a special talent and pride in
getting runty pigs all plumped up and doing fine in
scarcely no time at all. Indeed grandma certainly
had a way with little pigs, One time one of these
pigs got away on their way back home to Manti and
grandma had a hard time getting over that 'poor
little lost pig!'

"T remember driving to Manti with grandpa
in a horse and buggy with a cow tied on behind,
That was along, slow trip, Another thing I
remember about grandpa is how much he liked
fish of all kinds, but especially smoked herring.
He always ate fish the old Danish way, putting
whole pieces into his mouth - bone and all. Soon
the bones would come flying out either side of his
mouth, looking like 'cat's whiskers'; but some-
times they got caught in his moustache and had to
be untangled. Both grandpa and grandma came
to help us thin beets and later to harvest potatoes,
and of course father paid them. If they came from
Manti on the train they walked the mile from the
station at Christenburg to our house,

"Grandma expected to be minded and usually
got her way. I remember one time mother went
away and left her to tend Ada and me, when we
were quite young. Something we were doing
bothered grandma, perhaps it was playing in the
water ~ I don't quite recall now. Anyway she
cautioned us several times not to do it and the
last time with an 'or else'! But we continued to
defy her until we could see she meant business.
When she came toward us with that look in her
eye - we ran. To our utter surprise she took
after us and caught us and 'ker-plunk' her hand
came down several times, where it hurt the most.
I've never seen anyone run that fast, especially an
old woman.'' Perhaps grandmother Else figured
<span id="page-??"></span>
Prophecies Fulfilled 410

that the gentle Emma's children needed a little
discipline,

Cousin Ivy remembers that after they moved
to Salt Lake City grandma and grandpa always
came up for General and Semi-Annual Conferences
and stayed at their place. She remembers her bed-
room was next to theirs and she could never go to
sleep early when they were there in October for
they would lie in bed and talk about politics -
always politics - until way into the night. Since
grandmother was somewhat deaf in her later years,
she talked quite loud then too.

Elaine remembers that when Cullen was a
wee baby he had been very fretful with eczema or
something and she had taken him outside in his
baby buggy to wheel him to sleep, It took a long
time back and forth, back and forth. She had just
gotten him fast asleep and had wheeled him into the
shade and set the brake, preparatory to leaving him
there to sleep for awhile, covered with mosquito
netting to keep off the flies, when grandmother
came walking up the path to their place. As she
drew near, Elaine put her finger over her lips to
indicate "be quiet''. As grandmother approached
the place where Cullen lay she smiled and put her
finger over her lips too. Then she leaned over the
buggy to look at him, saying at the same time, 'UJa,
ve must be quiet for he is asleep'.. But her words
were not whispered but fairly "boomed out", and
of course Cullen awakened with a frightened scream,
Dear grandmother, she had no way of knowing how
loud she whispered, because of her deafness,

Cousin Rose wrote of Laurs and Else:-- |
"Memories of my grandparents are all too few, as
Iwas pretty young, but Ido remember grandma |
coming to our house to quilt for us and allowing
me to 'card' the wool, much to my delight.
Grandpa I remember with white hair blowing and
always a sweet smile and a moustache that tickled.
Somehow pictures of Albert Schweitzer remind me
of him, I'm sure these two lovely people were
largely responsible for the many wonderful traits
and beliefs that our Dad passed on to us and I am
very thankful indeed to be a part of their progeny."

The Great Giver of Life was continually
sending new little souls to earth to bless the lives
of Laurs and Else's children during those years,
but the Grim Reaper was ever close at hand also,

a girl, having preceded him in death. . . 8 Oct.
1913 Pauline C, Andersen, age 584 years, daugh-
ter of Christen and Karen Lauritzen Christensen
and Danish emigrant pioneer of 1866, died today

at her home in Centerfield, being survived by her
husband, Andrew Andersen, three daughters, Annie
Lenora 'Nora'! (Jensen), Karen Pauline "Carrie",
and Mattie Isabella (Dack), several grandchildren
and two brothers, Laurs M. C. Christensen of
Manti and Christen Christensen of Jutland, Den-
mark, ..3 Apr. 1914, Anne Jensen Christensen,
widow of Christen Christensen and Danish emigrant
pioneer of 1866, died at age 76 at her home in
Gunnison following an illness, She is survived by
one daughter, Caroline C, Jensen, three sons,
Christen K., Andrew E., and Joseph Y. Christen-
sen, two step-sons, Laurs M, C. and Christen
Christensen, the latter of Denmark, and numerous
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, But in spite
of it all, life went on for most of the Christensens
and their loved ones, at least a little longer, and
the sun continued to shine - or the rain fell,

As we recall, when Andrew B, had been pre-
paring to go to Europe in 1910 he had sold his home
in Salt Lake City to his older brother Chris. Chris
had in turn sold his old home in Gunnison to his
youngest brother Arthur M, These Christensen
brothers and sisters were great to stick together
and help each other out, In the latter part of 1915
the sister Elsie, having had somewhat of a tempor-
ary misunderstanding with her husband, felt it
necessary to sell her lovely red brick home in
Gunnison and move to cheaper quarters, so
brother Arthur M, bought her home and returned
his home, formerly owned by Chris, in on the deal.
Thus Elsie and her five children moved into the old
home and Arthur, Millie and their four children
occupied the red brick house, Louis D., who had
purchased his parents’ old home in Gunnison, was
away most of the time, being employed in Wyoming
with Chris and the Bennion Livestock Company, of
which Chris was general manager, Chris hada
home on ''The Weber'' where he took his family to
live in the summers, but during the winters they
were mostly alone in Salt Lake City where the
children could be in school, Elvena divided her

time between her sister-in-law Caroline, in Salt
Lake City, her sister-in-law Florence and her
sister Elsie in Gunnison, for she was still single
and much sought after as an unfailing support in
the homes of each and everyone of her loved ones,

Chris, always interested in the welfare of
others but especially in his own family and his
parents and brothers and sisters, was worried
about Elsie and her children and about Louis,
whose family was so far away and needed to be
near him, He was also concerned about Elvena,
whom he thought should be getting a husband, or
at least something of her own around her, So it
was about this time that he must have conceived
the idea of establishing a large family-owned and
operated ranch in Wyoming.

He himself had purchased 160 acres of land
east of Lyman, Wyoming, a few years before,
from the Bennion Livestock Company. There was
a lot of acreage adjoining his property there that
could be had almost for the asking. An earlier
home steading act involving that part of the terri-
tory allowed any responsible person to take up to
160 acres there who would settle on the land,
fence it in, cultivate it and add improvements,

As a further inducement to settlers the 'Grazing
Homestead Act of 1916" increased the amount of
land a person could homestead to 640 acres, prac-
tically saying "here is land - transform it into a
farm and it is yours!'' It must have seemed a
great idea to Chris, as well as a solution toa
number of the family problems, for some of his
folks to take advantage of this opportunity to obtain
land there and work together to build a successful
ranch, And being a man of action, as well as
vision, he must have successfully presented his
plan to various of his brothers and sisters, for
some of them soon filed on portions of land adjoin-
ing that which he owned twelve miles east of Lyman,
Wyoming,

In January 1916 Louis tock up 640 acres of
land near Chris and their sister, Elsie Bartholo-
mew, also took up 640 acres at the same time,
Chris' oldest daughter Peari filed on 320 acres
of property directly adjoining her father's, about

the same time. A little later the sister Elvena
took up 320 acres of land adjoining Louis’ property
and Andrew filed on 160 acres nearby. In fact,
each piece of property adjoined that of another
member of the family, making it quite a tract of
land in their joint possession, Earlier Chris had
named his place ''The Oasis" - so the Oasis it was
for all. a

Previously Chris had built a nice barn on his
land, with stalls for eight horses and pig pens and
a chicken coop and fixed places for hay and grain
stacks. Now he had a four-room frame dwelling
built on the dividing line between his and his daugh-
ter Pearl's newly acquired property, with two rooms
on her side and two rooms on his, with a pantry and
clothes closets too, This house was completed the
forepart of March 1916. In the meantime Louis was
making improvements on his place, putting up
fences and having a three-room log and frame house
built for his family. They were also having a two-
room house and attic built on Elsie's property to
house them and satisfy homesteading requirements,
Sometime later a two-room log cabin with an attic
was built on the sister Elvena's piece of land. A
well on Chris' place, though salty, supplied water
for the animals, but drinking water for the various
families had to be hauled in large barrels from a
spring in White Sand Hills about two miles east of
The Oasis,

On 27 March 19l6a grand exodus took place
from Gunnison, Utah, involving Elsie and her three
boys and two little girls and Florence and her six
children, now including her second daughter, little
two year old Alice Fern. Elvena must have also
gone along to help with the children, though she
had not yet applied for her land in Wyoming. The
night before the whole crew slept at sister Emma's,
for she lived within a mile of the depot, and that
morning they all boarded the train and headed for
Lyman, Wyoming. Louis must have come long
enough to help them move and Chris and his older
boys, Elmer and LeRoy, must have been on the
other end of the line to see that they all got out to
The Oasis safely, And since Louis' house was
not yet finished, nor Elsie's either, Pearl

remembers that they all stayed for awhile at her's
and her father's house, until the other two houses
were ready to move into. LaFaun remembers how
crowded they were and they slept on the floors and
some even had beds onthe table. Edith remembers
that there didn't ever seem to be food enough to go
around then,

But soon those that were able were out tilling
the soil and planting. Elsie tells of this in her own
history:-- 'The children and I worked hard clear-
ing the sagebrush, doing some planting of crops
and garden and making the necessary improvements
to 'prove up' on our homestead property for two
difficult summers,'' The Oasis raised potatoes,
not only for the folks who lived there but also to |
help supply the needs of those employed by the
Bennion Livestock Company, I understand Elsie
had charge of the planting and harvesting of num-
erous bushels of potatoes, which netted her a little
extra money, Grandfather Christensen went up to
Wyoming on occasions to help with the work there,
and grandmother sometimes went up to visit, In |
telling of those days she once said, with tears of
emotion in her eyes, ''My proud, my beautiful Else,
grubbing away there - working like a hired man in
the dirt!" Surely grandmother Else had forgotten
how she herself had labored at similar menial
tasks when she had lived in the United Order in
Mayfield so many years before.

Several years before, back in Sanpete,
Albert had sponsored one of his father's Danish
relatives and her family, making it possible for
her, her husband and two young daughters to come
from Denmark to America to live. He gave the
husband a job and the family a humble home on
his ranch west of Gunnison. Actually Laurs and
Else had been instrumental ina rranging the whole
thing soon after their return from Denmark,
These Danish relatives, who had joined the church
there, were eager to emigrate to Zion and needed
help in doing so, which Albert provided. But being
unused to American ways with the land, the cou-
sin's husband, Niels Jensen, turned out to be an
unprofitable farmer, though Albert gave him
reasonable opportunity to learn, So Albert's
<span id="page-??"></span>

brother Joseph took the Jensen family off his hands
and tried Niels Jensen out on his farm east of
Gunnison, Joseph even built the Danish relatives

a home there, which is still standing on the Keller
Christensen farm. But Niels Jensen was also a
disappointment as a farmer on Joseph's place as
well, so one of the Myrup cousins gave him a job
on his place. Lois Myrup Anderson writes some-
thing of this:-- ''A Danish cousin of our Christen-
sen's, and her husband Niels Jensen, lived in Hill
Creek, Uinta County one summer working for Uncle
Adolph Myrup. She bragged a lot about her 'wealthy
family in Denmark' and showed us pictures of their
big house there.'' The Niels Jensen family even-
tually ended up in California and seemed to like it
better there, These were among the few of grand-
father Christensen's Danish relatives to join the
Church and move to America, None of grand-
mother's relatives ever moved here or came even
to visit, as far as we know--or did any of them join
the church,

About a month after Louis and Elsie and their
families had moved to Wyoming, Albert's wife
Jennie, who had been in poor health for years,
became seriously ill and was taken to Salt Lake
City for special medical treatment, Some six
weeks later, Thur. 27 July 1916, she passed
away there and was brought back to Manti for
burial. Thus Albert, busy as Judge of the Seventh
Judicial District Court, was left without his
beloved companion and with five motherless child-
ren on his hands. Of course Laurs and Else and
others of the family did all they could at the time
to comfort and assist their bereaved loved ones,
and Elvena immediately came into her brother's
home to care for things there as best: she could.
Letters of condolence poured in from all over the
State and numbers of newspapers commented on
"Judge Christensen's great loss", Yet few could
do much to assuage the grief inthe home where
"the light had gone out'' for a time at least, Yet
"Aunt Vena'! was able to help so much with the
children then and of this one of them, Elaine,
writes:-- 'I may never be able to give Aunt Vena
credit for all she was to me when she came to live
with us after mother's death. I remember very

little of her before that time and might have for-
gotten as much as I have had I not been keeping a
journal while she was at our home, Although at
the time, by years she numbered thirty to my
fourteen, we shared secrets, activities and heart
pangs. Besides providing me and my friends with
home-made bread spread with thick cream and
sugar for an after school snack, she also provided
a sounding board for and a sympathetic understand-
ing of my restless teen-age fancies, as evidenced
by an entry in my journal, dated 14 June 1917:--
'Today has been another beautiful June day with its
deep blue sky and glowing sunset, We have com-
pleted our housecleaning today and are very glad
to get it over with. After the cleaning was done,
which was about 7:30 p.m., Aunt Vena and I
decided to follow the railroad track until dark, |
_ We sent after some candy and nuts and crackers,
which we wrapped ina bundle and started off,.
Saying we were going to grandma's. We went west
and then followed the long silver threads of tracks
until we thought we had gone almost four miles;
then we stopped and wished on each others bead
rings which Hale had given us. We wished on our -
bracelets and necklaces too, I wished three things
for myself and one very nice wish for Aunt Vena -
that she would soon fine a nice man for a husband..
After that, eating and jabbering away at each
other, we followed a road which we thought would
lead us into town. But the road had been flooded
over and, as I had a little hole in my shoe, I got
my foot wet. Finally we came to Main Street _
where we passed the dance hall and heard the
music, I began to pity myself because I wasn't ©
there, Aunt Vena said that we'd go home and if
Daddy wasn't there we'd get cleaned up and she'd
take me to the dance for a little while. My hair
had been in curls since Saturday and Aunt Vena
told me that it really looked awful, We fixed and
fixed but it still looked like a rat's nest and it was
black where I had curled it on the stove poker, So
we didn't go, She told me that she would help me
plan the party that we were going to have in a few
days. . . June 16, 1917 (Day of the party) We've
worked hard carrying benches, tables, victrola
and lights for the lawn. Dear Aunt Vena has

worked so hard cooking and sewing for us, etc.'!

"After mother died Aunt Vena (bowing before
the perplexities of problems attendant upon caring
for five young children) often dreamed of Jennie.
She must have seen her. in many teaching situations
of all kinds, taking time out to nod encouragement
and approval of Aunt Vena, who stood humbly on
the other side of the veil, seeking help, That
mother adored her for her sweetness, gentleness
and selflessness I have no doubt. As I look back
through the eyes of experience I can now know how
tired she must have been from all of our varied
demands, how lonely for love and attention from
friends her own age and yet how patient, under-
standing and available she was for our diversified
family needs, I know that she showed a great com-
passion for all of us and that she was especially
close to little Phillip, as she must have been also
to mother, Aunt Vena slept in the Blue Room with
five year old Phil who clung to her as a substitute
for his mother, One morning just at dawn she
awoke to see Phil smiling and nodding at someone
in the room, Aunt Vena turned inquiringly just in
time to see a flounce of skirt disappear down the
hall, Upon asking Phil who the visitor was, he
replied, 'I've been talking to my mama.' That
Aunt Vena herself lived close to the angels, I've
never doubted,"!

Laurs and Else were then living a little
nearer to Albert's in Manti, since they had given
up their place on Ist North and Ist East and moved
to a smaller place one-half block west of Main
Street on what is now known as Union Street, In
fact they were living directly across the street
north from the Tabernacle Block that had become
so important to them in their first years in Zion,
some fifty years before, when the Black Hawk
Indian War was in progress, They had contracted
to buy this 32-ft. by 107% ft. lot and the house on
it from John Lawrence and Anne J, Lowry.
Doubtless they had heard of the possibility of
buying it from their long time friend and associate,
Eliza R. Bartholomew, who herself had contracted
to purchase the place from one Lottie Hoggan and
then changed her mind after paying $100.00 down
<span id="page-??"></span>
419 Prophecies Fulfilled

on the bargain. Sister Bartholomew had sold her
contract to the Lowrys and Laurs and Else in turn
had got it from them. A warranty deed and abstract
to this property were made out to Laurs, 17 Apr. —
1922, indicating that by that time the place had

been fully paid for and terms of the contract met.
The price they had paid for it was $850 plus interest,
and another $100 to Sister Bartholomew for her
equity.

The house itself was along, rather narrow
two-story affair of adobe that opened almost
directly onto the front sidewalk on the south. It
must have previously been a little shop or store
of some kind with living quarters built on behind
and was first owned and built by a DeMill family.
As I recall, there were two rooms in front, a bed-
room, and a front room from which one descended
down several steps to a large living or ''sitting __
room" and kitchen area with a pantry. From here
there was a back stairs leading up to a couple of
spare bedrooms and an outside door to the west
leading to a small porch. There was a cemented.
cellar underneath but no inside bathroom, There
was little room for animals on the narrow lot,
except for a few chickens and perhaps a "'runty
pig''oralambortwo. There was a small rasp-
berry patch and room for enough garden for the
two of them, and they had enough primary water |
right in Manti City Creek to keep it watered.

This small place was about all Laurs and ©
Else could take care of at their ages, since they .
were then both pressing seventy. Although they
were two-and-a-half blocks farther away from ~
the temple than before, yet they were nearer the
Post Office and center of town and some nearer
their son Albert's, All in all this must-have
proved to be a comfortable arrangement for them,
The temple hack still continued to drive around
regularly to take them to their chosen work in
the Manti Temple, since they were very busy
there; for in 1915 Else had commenced the great
redemption work for her noble Hvid progenitors,
which line she had obtained back almost nine cen-
turies, through her professional Danish researcher, ©
to one Skjalm Hvide who had been born about 1052
<span id="page-??"></span>
Prophecies Fulfilled 420

in Roskilde, Copenhagen Amt, or County, Denmark,
Skjalm Hvide had married the Princess Signe
Haroldsen, daughter of King Harold IV of Denmark,
or Harold ''Hen" as he was anciently known, and

his wife Margrethe. Laurs helped Else by doing

the work for her male relatives, including old
Skjalm Hvide. He also did work for some of the
male dead of Brother Joseph Carpenter's, as has
been mentioned, and for others, by which means

he earned a modest living. It helped some in
regards to their living when, by a Government act
of March 4, 1917, Laurs became entitled to a

small pension amounting to $20.00 per month pay-
able quarterly, for his service in the Black Hawk
Indian War as a ''Private in Captain John H. Tuttle's
Company, Utah Militia Infantry."

-Laurs and Else must have started out house-
keeping in their new location with mostly brand new
furniture and equipment, or at least what was new
to them, though some may have been second hand.
Interestingly enough, an itemized bill for furniture,
rugs, etc,, purchased about the time of their
moving, was found among their papers in the Old
Brown Kit. It was from the Michigan Furniture
Company, 430-36 South State Street, Salt Lake
City, Utah and reads as follows:-- "Buffet - $35, 00;
Wash Stand - $2.50; Library Table - $15.00;

In my minds eye I can see now some of this
furniture and the way it was placed in that old
adobe house on West Union Street. Ican still see
also, in memory, some of the other things that
were there which helped to 'dress up!'' that house
and make it Grandpa's and Grandma's:-- dark red
plush covered, gilt edged Family Albums full of
photos of strange people resting on the library

table; hand made lace tidies here and there on the
backs and arms of the rockers and couch and some
well-used hand-painted velvet sofa pillows that had
seen better days on the seats of the same; brightly
colored hand cut, hand sewn and woven rag rugs
spread over the carpets to protect the spots of
greatest use; a few thrifty-looking potted plants

on the window sills; some heavily framed,
enlarged photographs of relatives hung on the

front room walls and a gay printed calendar in the
kitchen and a pendulum-swinging-clock on the
clock shelf ticking off the minutes and singing out
in most positive tones the precise time every hour,
But Grandmother wasn't much for collecting ''do-
dads" and folderol - she loved people more than
things!

I used to go there often during the year after
mother Jennie died, and I always felt welcome and
so comfortable there, Though the house was right
across the road from school, north, I would go
around by way of the Post Office to pick up the
mail in my grandparents' box and take it to them
on my way home from school in the late afternoons,
Iusually arrived at their place soon after the
temple hack had dropped them off following the
afternoon session in the temple. I remember
Grandpa, having pulled black sateen sleeve pro-
tectors well up over the elbows of his white
starched shirt, would usually be stretched out
full length on the couch in the front room, resting.
He was always glad for the mail; it saved hima.
trip to town after a wearying day at the temple.

But most of all I remember Grandma, softly
humming as she moved about fixing their late
afternoon meal of cold sliced meat and cheese,
bread, butter and jelly, coffee cake or sweet rolls
and a hot drink, She would cease her humming to
greet me with a smile and a loving kiss, saying,
"Vel, vel, if here isn't cur dear Weryinya!" -
just as if she hadn't seen me for a time, even
though I'd been there the day before and the day
before that, (She always pronounced my name
that way inthe tender, caressing, intimate style
she had of speaking to those she loved - and I
loved her for it!) Then she would insist that I

<span id="page-??"></span>
Prophecies Fulfilled 422

stay and ''have a bite" with them, This I always
hungrily hoped for but tried to appear reticent
about - but Grandma wouldn't be put off - and so
I'd stay and pull up a chair to the dining room
table in the front room where the cloth and things
were set, Then she would fetch the coffee pot or
the tea pot from the kitchen stove, as the case
might be, and while she was filling their cups she
would say in the most natural and hospitable way,
"Vil you haf a cup of tea (or coffee) Weryinya?'"'
She wouldn't wait for an answer but would quickly
place a cup and saucer for me and pour in some
hot water from the teakettle, put in plenty of cream
‘and plop in a couple of sugar cubes, She even
stirred it up for me. I guess this was what they
called "Brigham Tea''- the only kind of tea Brig-
ham Young approved of for the Latter-day Saints.
Iwas never given regular coffee or tea in my
grandparents’ home, or my parent's either. But
drinking tea and coffee was one of the very few
vices Laurs and Else allowed themselves; it would
have been pretty hard for them to have broken this
habit of a lifetime - and they never did.

Sometimes on Saturdays I went to Grand-
mothers in the morning when she would be doing
her "heavy cooking''for the week. The most
delectable eating of my childhood came if I was
fortunate enough to be there when she was making
"Abelskivers", thos delicious little bell shaped
tender Danish apple pancakes made with plenty of
fresh eggs, alittle flour, salt, buttermilk, grated
‘apple, soda and whatnot, and fried just so in small
lakes of butter in little round mold pans made just
for that purpose, There was magic in the way she
turned them gently over, Then she rolled them in
a bed of sugar and served them up piping hot with
one's favorite jelly or preserves, Tome, nothing
has ever tasted so ''yummy'' as Grandmother Else's
freshly made abelskivers,

She had other kitchen specialties of course,
like her Danish soup and dumplings, Her ''sweet
soup'' and ''red mush"' for the makings of which she
always seemed to have raspberries, red currents
and a plum tree on the place, were happy changes
for one who was so used to rice pudding, sego
<span id="page-??"></span>
423 Prophecies Fulfilled

pudding, bread pudding, custard or blancmange
for dessert. Then there was that home made
Danish beer which all the adults in the family
used to make such a fuss about. When each new
batch of Grandmother's Danish beer had duly
"ripened!" and was ready for the tasting, word
would go out from her place and the big folks
would swarm in and have a cork-popping good
time of it! Though I never learned to like that
harmless Danish beer that Grandma made, I
loved the happiness and hospitality of those many
little family festivals we had at her and Grandpa's
place when the beer was "ripe",

Grandmother Else could cook and she could
sew and she could fix up her house, and these she
did and did well, and she was the most charming,
lovable hostess, in her unpretentious, homespun
way, that one could imagine. She never apologized
for the things she had or had not, but seemed
grateful for all she had been given, but especially
for all the choice opportunities that the Gospel and
the Land of Zion afforded her and hers. If she
yearned for fancy things for herself and her home
we did not know it; but I doubt that she ever pined
much for ornamental decorations, rich tapestries
and fixtures, magnificent paintings or other works
ofart, Her needs were simple it seemed, and yet
who knows, perhaps she too 'dreamt that she dwelt
in marble halls" at times, The only personal orna-
ments we ever saw her wear were simple amber.
ear-drops hanging from her pierced ears, an
amber colored shell comb in her braided crown
of amber colored hair, then streaked with grey,
and a plain gold brooch. Indeed, the things Grand-
mother seemed most interested in were richness
of the spirit and the culture of the soul. The things
for which she seemed to strive most were the arts
of living, serving, loving and learning, I often saw
her studying by the lamplight at nights, bespectacled
in little oval shaped eye glasses with fragile wire
rims and bows, She loved to read - to study - to
learn - to keep abreast of things, As they say of
those who never quite grow old in spirit, 'She
grew a little green wood every year,"

During that year of 1916/17, after mother

Jennie died, Aunt Vena lived with us, Albert's
family, as has been stated, About the first part
of July that second summer, however, she was
persuaded to leave and go to Wyoming by Uncle
Chris, who seemed very anxious to get her up
there for some special reason, In fact it was
perhaps Chris himself who took her there on one
of his various business trips back and forth from
Sanpete. It turned out that he was anxious to have
Vena meet a young bachelor from Upton, Utah, by
the name of George T, Clark, who was one of the
herders for the Bennion Livestock Co, As Chris
had observed the character and habits of this man
in his employ he had found him to be an all around
honest, clean, good and fine fellow and was
thoroughly convinced that George would make Vena
a splendid husband, So Chris took Vena to stay
with some of the folks and saw to it that she and
George got together, doing all he could to foster
a match.

It was but a few weeks before Elvena Chris-
tensen and George Thomas Clark were married,
for of course Chris had built each of them up to it
well beforehand, They went to the Uinta County
courthouse in Evanston, Wyoming, 14 Aug, 1917
to secure their license and then sought out the
LDS Bishop to perform the marriage ceremony.
Each of them was thirty years old at the time but
they were as thrilled and happy as a couple of
teenagers,

8. WYOMING INTERLUDE

The part of Western Wyoming in which some
of the Christensens were now living was in the
general area known as Bridger Basin, through
which what was left of a once mighty river wound
its way. Long ago Fort Bridger, from which the
region got its name, was a precious shelter from
Indian's tomahawks - the same Indians who finally
whooped themselves into tame and stupid retreats
on the reservations, Pioneering inthis unmade
country was first begun a hundred years ago by
railroad workers who came to build the Union
Pacific Railroad which now bisects the territory.
<span id="page-??"></span>
425 Wyoming Interlude

The flapping tent villages of these rail-
roaders were soon replaced by homesteaders
cabins, Then Wyoming's vast sagebrush and grass
covered prairies caught the eyes of stock raisers,
and "cattle barons" with their immense herds
moved in, Thousands of cattle grazed and roamed
at will over the range and cattle raising became
the territory's first major industry. At first most
of the range cattle there were owned by non-resi-
dents who came but once a year from the east to
look after their interests in Wyoming - thus the
name ''Cattle Barons" was given them.

Resenting the ever increasing power of the
non-resident stockraisers inthe business and
politics of Wyoming, homesteaders began fencing
in their land along the streams in order to protect
themselves from ranging cattle and to break up the
range, Cattlemen retaliated by having their
employees file on property and, not content to
fence in homesteads alone, they often included
whole sections of public domain between their own
property, thus gaining control of millions of acres
and preventing the free use of public lands. Angry
homesteaders, who would not steal from their
neighbors, began to think nothing of rounding up
calves belonging to some far distant "cattle baron"
and applying their own brands, ''Careless applica-
tion of the branding irons" brought increasing
financial losses and embarrassment and threatened
the paradise of the cattlemen, Cattle and horse
thieves flourished and rustling became a big
business on the ranges of Wyoming.

Failing to pin down these ''bandits of the
plains" or to secure protection from them through
the courts, some cattlemen felt forced to take the
law into their own hands and life on the prairies
of Wyoming took on the aspects of a civil war.
Lynchings, shootings from ambush and other
methods of frontier justice became the style as
cattlemen made a strong effort to hold the range.
Some hired "regulators! to kill the rustlers and
frighten homesteaders fromthe territory. On one
occasion paid professional gunmen were secretly
brought into Cheyenne, Wyoming in a sealed rail-
road car to join in the fray; and though the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 426

importation of hired gunmen from other States
was against the constitution, yet it continued,
Homesteaders were killed and their property
burned, It was a bigger, bloodier war than the
outside world suspected. It reached its peak in
1901. Bitterness and prejudice prevailed and
popular sympathy was divided between cattlemen
and homesteaders, Accounts of trouble were
usually contradictory and garbled and the local
authorities threw up their hands indismay, But
law abiding citizens were indignant at the flagrant
disregard for law which allowed wholesale murder
of guilty and innocent alike, Federal authorities
were finally called in to intervene in this inter-
sectional warfare between rustlers, homesteaders
and cattlemen, Conviction and execution of a
"regulator" in 1903 ended it to all purposes, but
the rustling went on about the same.

Meantime, it had been discovered that
Wyoming ranges were ideal for sheep raising.
Sheep could graze the arid and semi-arid regions
there and the dry, cold climate helped to produce
a heavy growth of long, fine wool. So trailing
sheep through Wyoming became another profitable
industry. This began to annoy the cattlemen and,
having failed to remove the rustlers entirely from
the range, they began to concentrate on getting rid
of the ever increasing herds of sheep which trailed
through the country and fed on the public domain.
They argued that the ranges were becoming over-
stocked, but especially that cattle would not graze
where sheep had been - that sheep had an offensive
odor and that they ruined the range, Frank Benton
stated the situation in this rhyme:--

"Sheep range - cattle sure won't graze
But cowboys hate sheep anyways !"!

Various practices were adopted by the

cattlemen in different parts of the State to drive

out the sheep owners, Cowboys stampeded whole
herds of steers through flocks, Some bands were
driven over cliffs, Poison was scattered on the
salt-sage to kill the sheep, When attacks on the
sheep failed more drastic measures were taken -
herders were killed, wagons were burned and herds
were scattered, For example, in 1905 Louis A,
<span id="page-??"></span>
427 Wyoming Interlude

Gantz was trailing 7,000 sheep to the Big Horn
Forest Reserve for grazing, Ten masked men
visited his camp, which was about 40 miles from
the town of Basin. They clubbed and shot 4, 000

of his sheep, burned his wagons, killed a team of
horses, destroyed $700 worth of grain, and warned
his herders to leave the country and never return,
This ''Cattlemen's and Sheepmen's War" finally
ended in 1909 and forced the recognition of the
sheepmen's rights to a share ofthe range,

These great borderland dramas were almost
at an end when Chris took over the management of
the Bennion Livestock Company (1908). This was
an organization owned in the main by Chris himself
and John M. Cannon, also of Salt Lake City; but
there were other stockholders, According to
Chris' daughter Pearl, the company controlled or
owned about 50,000 acres of range land and sum-
mer lambing ground on which they cared for their
thousands of head of sheep, plus a few cattle and
horses, An extensive ranch and summer range
land in the Weber River Valley in northeastern
Utah served as the company's main base of opera-
tion, The ranch itself they called ''The Weber'!
and here they had a large two-story ranch house,
Through successful irrigation methods which
Chris first introduced there, he and his hired
help were able to raise thousands of tons of wild
or ''white' hay. The Company also had rangeland »
in Chalk Creek Basin near the head of the Weber.
River and also owned property at Trout Creek and
Manila and on the West Desert, where they owned
two ranches and leased the school sections, They
also owned a small ranch at Upton, Utah, about
twenty miles over the mountain from The Weber, |
where many of the company's cattle and horses
were cared for and hay and grain raised, Chris'
brother Arthur managed and farmed this ranch
for the Bennion Livestock Company for four or
five years (1911-1915), He was a stockholder for
a time,

The Company wintered four herds of sheep
of about 2, 500 each, near a place in western
Wyoming called Carter, which being on the rail-
road was an outfitting place for sheepmen who
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 428

came there for supplies, They wintered two
similar herds down at Manila where it was a little
warmer and they could feed some hay. They also
sent one large dry herd onto the West Desert in
Skull Valley. In the spring the herds from Carter
and Manila trailed to the lambing grounds at places
about thirty miles southwest of Carter, called
Spring Valley and at Piedmont, Wyoming. From
the lambing grounds the sheep trailed on to the
large shearing corral which Chris and John Cannon
had built at Altmont, Wyoming. Here thousands of
sheep were sheared each spring for several years,
At Piedmont they also had a large dipping vat
where they dipped the sheep to kill the ticks the
years the sheep ticks were so bad (1915-16 and
1917-18). From the shearing corrals the sheep
trailed on to their summer range on The Weber,
This trailing was hard on sheep and men, sheep
dogs and horses too. Chris was always on the job
at those times with the buckboard and ''Fannie'' the
mule, and 'Old Bay''his faithful horse, Later he
got a Ford pickup truck which made things easier
for him and traveling much faster,

The Bennion Livestock Company employed
quite a number of men each year, including a
manager and workers on each ranch, as well as
two herders with each of its many herds, plus
"Camp Jacks'"' who were the men engaged to cook
and care for the camps and horses, As mentioned,
Chris' brother Arthur managed the Upton ranch for
the company and his brother Louis helped with the
herds, George Clark, mentioned as having mar-
ried Chris's sister Elvena, was one of the depend-
able herders and Peter A. Jensen, who later
married Chris' daughter Pearl, was assistant
manager of the company as well as one of the
herders, Chris' two older sons, Elmer and LeRoy,
helped with the sheep or on the ranches as soon as
they were old enough,

Chris often bought hay for his company in
and near Lyman, Wyoming, which was a number
of miles east of Carter, and he became well
acquainted in the area and bought some property
for the company from a Mr. C. N. Larsen about
12 miles east of Lyman, 160 acres together with

water rights for part of it, part being in alfalfa
and part dry farm. About 1913 Chris, as before
mentioned, had bought this 160 acres from the
company as an investment, Later, with his encour-
agement, some of his brothers and sisters had
taken up the adjoining homestead land together
with a certain amount of range land that went with
these homesteads, until by the middle of 1917 most
of the ground still available in this area had been
taken up by members of the Christensen family.

On this jointly owned land, The Oasis, Chris, his
daughter and his brothers and sisters envisioned

a large and prosperous estate some day.

In the meantime, war clouds had gathered
over Europe and by 1914 the major countries there
were involved in a bloody struggle, It had been
hoped that the United States could be kept free of
this conflict but by April 1917 she had been swept
into it. Soon two million American men were
fighting with their allies in Europe and an equal
number were training in this country preparatory
to going over there. Thus with the coming ofa
bright new century with its new inventions, enter-
prises, and miracles, came the shadow of this
new century war - 'a war to end all wars'' it was
said, Would people never learn then?

Back in western Wyoming on The Oasis,
that middle of September 1917, this war must have
seemed far away. Louis, Florence and their six
children were living in their three-room house
there, improving their property and harvesting
their crops, Elsie and her five children were
living in their two-room house not far away,
cleaning up their land and getting ready to harvest
their potatoes, Elmer and LeRoy, or ''Roy''as we
shall henceforth call him, usually took turns with
the herds or farming on their father's and sister
Pearl's places each summer, This summer Roy
was on The Oasis with Pearl, helping to harvest
the hay and grain they had raised, Elvena (now
Mrs, George T, Clark) was living alone in her
two-room log cabin, her husband being away with
the sheep most of the time, All seemed peaceful
and serene there that lovely autumn, but clouds
of trouble were gathering on the horizon for them
<span id="page-??"></span>

also, Following are extracts from a testimony
later given by Louis:--

'T reached Lyman, Wyoming in December
1913. I remained here in the country until the
spring of 1914. Iwas with the Bennion Livestock
Company, an assistant to my brother Chris "I"
Christensen. He was then the general manager
of this company. I never was a stockholder but I
worked for the company every winter after I came
here. I took up my land in January 1915, I moved
my family here in March 1916 and moved them
directly to the ranch, , . I built my first house in
the spring of 1916. It was a log and frame house
and it was burned down in October 1916. At that
time I attached no importance to this and did not
think it was a criminal act. I rebuilt the house in
the spring of 1917. . . The only trouble I had had
in the county up to this point was with a Mr.
at the oil well about 25 miles west of Carter, who
shot at a herder of C, I. Christensen's and C, I,
saw him about the matter,

"On September 14, 1917 Iwas at my ranch
and my wife and children were there, On this day
Iwas ploughing during part of the day and in the
afternoon I went and hauled water from the spring
and then fixed up my wagon to haul wood, I
retired between nine and ten o'clock, During the
night our dog barked and attracted my attention,
This was between about two and three o'clock A.M,
About three o'clock I heard a horse come in and
up to the east side of the house and then a little
later take off onthe run, I remarked to my wife,
"IT guess Mike (our dog) is running "Old Cap" off.
(Old Cap is one of my horses,) I laid there for a
few moments, I had my clock set for four o'clock
and got up to see what time it was. When I went to
the south room (kitchen) I saw the reflection of a
light through the window and I went to the door and
opened it and got the smell of fumes, I stepped out
and saw a blue flame about six inches high at the
edge of the roof and at the same time detected an
odor that smelled like wood alcohol. I put out the
fire with the water I had hauled, I found part ofa
torch, a piece about two inches long and an inch
wide. It looked like canvas or piece of water bag
<span id="page-??"></span>

and there was charcoal there as if it had been
attached to a stick and it seemed as though there
was a little piece of cotton or wool about the size
of my fingernail and then ashes of old rags. It
had burned through the shingles and into the sheet-
ing under the shingles for about 23 ft. wide and

3 or 4 ft. long. After daylight I discovered the
horses tracks and followed them from the house
and along the road clear up to Mr. White's on the
way to Lyman, There sheep had come into the
road and obliterated the tracks, I went at once to
Bishop Rawlins and reported this attempted burn-
ing to him, and the following day I went to Evanston
and talked to County Attorney Mathews, I had
received a threatening letter in July but had told
no one of it up to this time, I then told Bishop
Rawlins about it, I returned home after my trip
to Evanston and watched every night from then on
but saw nothing,

"But on the night of Sept. 20th someone
came again but Idid not hear them, though I was
up until about midnight watching, The next morn-
ing my oldest boy went out and there found, on the
south side and about six feet from where the other
fire had been, someone had attempted to again
light a fire, I found tracks of a horse that had
been standing outside, This was the same track
as the first one, I followed this track up on the
bench two hundred yards to where I found another
track as though a horse had been standing. There
was evidence of this and where it had turned around
there, One horse was sharp-shod, the same as the
first track, the other was shod on the front feet
with old shoes, I followed the tracks up to Jenson's
and then a lot of horses had come in and so oblit-
erated the tracks that Ilost them, I reported this
to the sheriff by phone and also to Bishop Rawlins,
The sheriff said, 'We will have to do something
about this', but he did not come. Dewey Rawlins
came out to watch with me and we watched all the
night of the 2lst, but nothing happened.

"On the night of the 22nd Dewey and I came
out of the house and we heard a signal - it was a
whistle. We went out by the barn and out on the
canal bank and while there we heard someone in
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 432

the potato patch between us and the house, I sent
Dewey down along the south side of the potato patch
and I went north along the canal. A man ran out of
the northwest corner of the potato patch and I shot
at him in the dark as he was running. I shot at him
a second time as he was near the bank of the canal
and I think I hit him, because I heard the bullet
strike something. We searched along the canal
that night but found no one and it began to rain very
hard and was very dark, The next morning we went
out and found where someone had fallen on some
sagebrush, There were imprints in the mud of
clothing, as though it was corduroy, and there
were footprints; but on account of the rain they
were so that we could not properly measure them.
Tracks of two horses had come together at this
point and it looked as though someone had gotten
on one of the horses and ridden off. Dewey and I
followed the tracks across the bench and from the
creek towards Mr. White's house. We believed
they were the same tracks that we had seen before.
I reported this to the county sheriff's office but no
one came out, But on Monday night Attorney
Mathews was advised by Bishop Rawlins of the
matter and he came to the ranch on Tuesday."

It was quite apparent that someone wished to
make trouble for the Christensens by trying to burn
them out, or at least frighten them into leaving the
place, The anonymous letter received by Louis on
July 14, 1917, though he had paid no attention to it
at the time and destroyed it, not wanting to frighten
his family, had given him three months to move out
or he would be burned down. But the threaténer
had waited only two months to make the attempted
burning. In the newspaper published at Lyman,
the first article in relation to the burning was
under the date of Sept, 25th, mentioning the
attempted fires on the nights of 14th, 20th and 22nd
of September and stating that the County Attorney
and the sheriff were in Lyman on the case by the
25th. The Bridger Valley Enterprise also printed
an account of the threatened burnings, But every-
one in the region was talking about it and rumors
flew thick and fast, Suspects were found on every
hand, centering mostly on one particular crowd.

A certain Mr. So-and-so was said to have made the
<span id="page-??"></span>
433 Wyoming Interiude

statement that it was 'no worse for a man to be
burned out than to be eaten out and by reason of |
Christensen eating him out he had lost about twelve
hundred head of sheep''. Other suspicious state-
ments were reported, but no one could really find
out the motive and as the truth was hidden and thus
unknown, rumors flew to take its place. |

The testimony of Uinta County Sheriff Lowhan
backs up the statements Louis had made:-- "I
heard of the trouble the day I was called there the
first time. It was about the 25th. Christensen
came in and told me about it and said someone had
attempted to burn him out by throwing a wick or
rags on the roof. He told me about a letter but
that it had been destroyed. I did not go up until
the time he was supposed to have shot someone.
Imet County Attorney Mathews at Lyman and went
to investigate the attempted burnings. When I got
west of the place the shooting was alleged to have
taken place, Mathews and Christensen joined me
and Christensen showed me the east and the south
side of his house where burning attempts had been
made. It was burned in both places and through.
the shingles in one. He showed me the remnants .
of the torch; it looked like pieces of old drawers,
charred and nearly all ashes.

"The house is a three-room frame house
about twenty by sixteen feet. It faces east.
There is a hill behind it to the west. He showed
me where he stood when he shot. He was up on the
ditch bank to the west. I saw where a man had
fallen on the brush and left imprints'of corduroy
in the mud, but the brush was broken down and [
could not measure his tracks on account of the
rain, It had rained all night but the tracks did
show that horses had come to where the man was
lying. There were two tracks came up to him and
I could measure those tracks, We followed them
to the road and then they went towards Lyman,
They came off from the hill towards Lyman.
There was no blood to be found anywhere along
there to indicate that the man might have been
wounded. On this trip I deputized L. _D. Christen-
sen and left him there."

It is easy to see how these threats aroused
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 434

the fear of the families living on the Oasis, If

one was in danger they ali were. LaFaun, then
nearly sixteen, remembers taking her turn stand-
ing guard with a gun at nights, Edith, Elsie's
oldest daughter, recalls how her two older
brothers, A, Owen and Edgar, used to stand guard
at their place at nights and how even her dear
mother stood outside with a gun, taking her turn
at guarding, night after night. She remembers,
during those frightening times, that as soon as it
was dark all the lamps would be put out and she
and her younger sister Ellamae would be put to
bed and told to stay there and not get up and run
around under any conditions, or ''the mean men
would come and burn the house down!" - ''Firebugs"!
was what they called them. On the other hand,

A. Owen, then a brave lad of fifteen and man of the
house, now remembers that he thought the whole
thing was more or less ''much ado about nothing"!
at the time.

Thus a week went by on The Oasis and Sun-
day, September 30, 1917 came around, Chris, who
went back and forth between the herds, the ranches
and his home in Salt Lake City, was not there but
Pearl and Roy were there living in Pearl's house
and had been helping with the harvest. But let
Pearl tell of it:-- 'The harvest was over, the land
cleared of alfalfa, grain, oats, wheat and lucerne
seed; the potatoes had been harvested - we raised
lots of potatoes for the company. Five huge stacks
of hay were piled in our yard, as well as large
stacks of oats, wheat and alfalfa seed waiting for
the threshers, It was a quiet Sunday evening the
last of September, about 8 o'clock, Supper was
over, the dishes done, and Roy and I were sitting
reading. All at once I looked up to see everything
so bright and said, 'Oh, what's that bright light -
it looks like the sun coming up!' We rushed to the
door and opened it and looking out saw everything
in the yard ablaze! The stacks were on fire about
50 ft. from the house, Horses were screaming,
pigs squealing and chickens clacking. We ran out
and started fighting fire, Idrew water from the
well and Roy threw it onthe barn, It seemed only
minutes until Aunt Elsie's boys and Uncle Lou
were there and with their help we got the four
<span id="page-??"></span>
435 Wyoming Interlude

horses out and saved the pigs and the barn, but all
the crops - a whole years work - were burned to
the ground, Soon some people came from Lyman;
they had seen the flames from that distance,
Someone went for father and he came the following
night,."'

We now go on with Uncle Lou's story:-- "On
the 30th of September 1917 I was home with my
family and Dewey Rawlins was there with me,

_ This night we went up west of our place and then
Dewey went south to circle around the south and
east side of the place while I was going to the
west. When I got up on the hill I saw my brother's
place burning and I ran over there. Later Dewey
came over and Iasked him, 'What about my place?!
He ran back towards my place. A little later I
started back towards my house and then I heard
some shots in that direction and started to run.

As I was running along towards my home I came.
near what is called 'the Old Bedstead', on the
bench, and here someone shot at me and struck
me through the coat, though the bullet only

grazed my skin. When I reached the house,
Dewey reported to me that he had seen a man west
of the house and had shot at him several times, It
was now about 11 P,M, Later we tracked two _
horses from my brother, C, I. Christensen's
place to my place, where they separated upon the
hill west of my house, Later they had joined again
and we tracked them towards Lyman,"

Here is the statement of Deputy Sheriff
Twombly of Uinta County about his activities the.
Same night:-- 'On Sunday, 30th Sept., I went to
Lyman and on out to C, I, Christensen's, while
the stacks were still burning, I found tracks close
to the stacks, There was one horse track that I
tracked from the hill to L. D, Christensen's house
and to within 40 yards of the house, It looked as
though the horse was there tied and that a man got
off and went down from the hill, from which, near
to the Christensen house, I followed his tracks to
within 50 yards of it and into the potato patch south-
west of the house, It appeared as though he stopped
here and then left running, He ran out of the potato
patch and up towards the old bedstead that is
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 436

standing upon the hill and there he kneeled down
and I could see the corduroy imprints in the place.
This was where L. D. Christensen claims to have
been shot at by a man who was kneeling near this
bedstead. I found no shells at this point but mea-
sured the horse tracks, They came from the south
side of the burned stacks, up past the west end and
around the east side. There seemed to be but one
track but there could also have been a horseman
on the opposite side. A lane runs east and west,

I followed the track from C. I,'s place in a southerly
direction towards L, D,'s and then west, L. D.
Christensen and Dewey Rawlins helped me and we
measured the man's tracks thirty or forty times -
they were the same, a cowboy boot, We watched
Christensen measure the tracks of both horses,
First he measured the tracks near his home and
he and Rawlins both claimed that they were the
same that they had seen there before. Charley
White, who lives west of Christensen's, claims
that he heard his dogs bark early in the evening
but did not go out to see whether anybody was
passing or not,"

Impressions of then five year old Ellamae
are included in her present history thus:-- '. ..
About this time we moved with mother to a home-
stead near Lyman, Wyoming, where Uncle Chris,
Pearl, Uncle Lou, Uncle Andrew, and later Aunt
Vena also had homesteads. To me this was quite
an adventure, Iwas oblivious to the problems of
clearing the land and making a home of stretches
of sagebrush, but remember the huge bonfires of
sagebrush when the land was cleared. We explored
the hills during the days, free as the wind, but after
dark we were afraid to venture out. I remember
my brothers sitting watch with a gun, and of
returning home to find rocks thrown through the
window. I remember waking one night to see
Uncle Chris! haystacks on fire. , . At the time
I didn't know anything about range wars between
the cattlemen, sheepmen and homesteaders - it
was only something frightening."

Chris came the night after his crops were
fired and a few others came to help guard the
homes of the Christensens on The Oasis, Someone

with a gun was at each dwelling and others had set
places to keep an eye out for, Each was cautioned
to shoot into the air as a warning for help if any-
thing unusual took place or anyone strange was
seen intheir area, There was a tenseness of fore-
boding in the air. Twenty-three year old Pearl and
her brother Roy, nearing seventeen, were on guard
at her's and their father's place on the night of
Tuesday, Oct, 2nd, 1917. Chris himself, saying
he was going down to one of his sister's places to
see how things were there, had left going in that
direction. The lights were out in the house but the
door was open in order that the two inside could
have a better view of the yard, though the opening
was protected by a screen door, Suddenly each .
‘saw, almost simultaneously, something moving
outside in the brush nearby - it looked like a man
crouched down, They both sprang to the door to
give a warning shot. One held the screen door
open while the other prepared to shoot into the air.
‘The action was almost automatic as they had been
so carefully instructed by their father in what.to

do in such a case,

But then something went wrong, The motion
that triggered the gun also jarred loose the screen
door and it swung into the path of the bullet and
banged shut, deflecting the shot to where it never.
had been aimed or intended, worlds without end.
It all happened so rapidly and then came the startling
and heart-rending cry into the night - "Oh...
You've got me!'' It was their father's voice, No
one on earth had known that the time of Christian I,
Christensen's probation was to be over then or
that so successful. a career would come to so sad .
anend, But though mortally wounded and in |
intense pain, heaven granted this exceptional man
a few more days of life that he might comfort his
grief-stricken children and try to make them
understand that they were no more to blame than
he, for he had thought they were asleep when he
had returned unexpectedly and thus failed to tell
them, Reason tells us that no one was to blame,
except perhaps the person or persons who had
perpetrated the whole thing inthe first place.

His wife and family were quickly notified and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 438

Caroline came before he passed away, 5 Oct. 1917,
the day after his fiftieth birthday. His oldest son,
eighteen year old Elmer, then farming onthe ranch
in Cedar Valley, had had a premonition that some-
thing was wrong before he got the upsetting word;
for he had dreamed, or imagined, that his father
came and stood in the door of his tent the night
before,

They took the body to Gunnison, Utah, for
burial beside his daughters, Elora and Orilla, in
the family plot there. Then the bereaved Caroline
and her six fatherless children, Pearl 23, Elmer 18,
Roy nearing 17, Ivy near 13, Farrald 8 and Gordon
53, went back to their home in Salt Lake City for a
time. They had difficult days and decisions ahead.
But always life must go on somehow for those that
are left, and soon they were back again doing what
they had to do, some in Wyoming and others in
Salt Lake City.

Elsie's daughter, Ellamae, tells about going
to Utah when her Uncle Chris died:-- 'I remember
when Uncle Chris was shot; and when he died we
rode with his body to Evanston, from where we
went by train to Salt Lake City and on to Gunnison.
In Evanston Edith and I had to go to bed in the hotel
with our shoes on because we had left the button
hook home.'' Men were left guarding at The Oasis
while the occupants were all away, for even in the
face of this tragedy no safety could be felt for their
homes there. Sheriff Lowhan made this statement: --
"T came back to the Christensen's ranch on Oct. 4th,
“after C, I. was shot and stayed there until the 9th.
On this trip I remained while L. D. took his
brother's body to Utah for burial. Dewey Rawlins
and Rube Field were there one night watching and

from the 9th to the 12th Deputy Sheriff Twombly
was there."

Louis and his family, Elsie and hers, as well
as Vena, returned to the ranch in Wyoming as soon
as possible, for this was their home and they had
no intention of abandoning the struggle to save what
they had there from the evil forces that seemed
determined to drive them out, Elsie of course
planned to move into Lyman for the winter to put
the children in school, as she had the year before,
<span id="page-??"></span>
439 Wyoming Interlude

and Florence planned to do the same. We quote
again from the testimony of Louis:-- 'I moved my
family away from the ranch and into Lyman on Oct,
20, 1917, but I remained there at the place and
others were with me,

"On Nov. 19th Iwas in Lyman and left be-
tween three and four o'clock P.M, to go over to
the ranch, arriving there before dark, I put my
horses in the barn and then went over to the sheep
camp about a mile south and east, Elmer Chris-
tensen and Miles Critchley were at the camp. I
expected to have supper there with them and then
go back to the house, but they induced me to stay
for the night. We went to bed but the sheep were
restless and woke us up, We got up to see what
was the matter and it was then that we saw that
my house was on fire, This was between eleven
and eleven thirty that night. We at once ran over
to the place. It looked at first like only the roof
on the east side was on fire, but we found that the
whole house was burning and it burned to the
ground, There was nothing we could do to stop it.
We later found that horse tracks came in at the
gate and went up to the west window. We followed
this track back west again; it was what we called
a 'malable shoe' and the first time I had seen a
track of this kind."' The sheriff was notified next
morning and he came out to the ranch to investi-
gate; his statement follows:-- ''I went out again
when L, D.'s place was burned.and I found the
track came down the road and in the mud to the
northeast corner of the house and passed the
north end of the house and turned west and then
turned in close to the house and then went back
the same way, out of the gate and up the road
towards Lyman. I measured the track. It was 6
inches from toe to heel and 34 inches between
heels, It was anew shoe. There was just one
horse track, "!

Someone was responsible for these burnings
at The Oasis and it was not the ghosts of past
range wars, The Uinta County officials were
anxious to get at the bottom of things.. Judge
Albert Christensen of Manti, Utah, lawyer of the
family, was likewise determined to see that the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Wyoming Interlude 440

guilty parties who had caused so much misery and
anxiety were found and brought before the law, He
was instrumental in getting the Uinta County
officials to hire the help of a private investigator
or detective from the Burns Detective Agency in
Salt Lake City to work with them secretly, gather-
ing evidence and tracking down the criminals,
Albert himself engaged a well known criminal
lawyer of Salt Lake City to work on the case,
evaluating evidence, interviewing witnesses and
taking testimonies, as well as to assist in the pro-
secution should the case come to trial.

The report of the activities of this private
detective in his efforts to track down the parties
guilty of trying to burn out the Christensens in
what was known as ''The Uinta County, Wyoming
Arson Investigation", is full of drama and intrigue,
but will have to wait for a later telling. Though
arrests were made, the suspects were let out on
bail and the case never came before the courts,
nor were there ever any convictions, While the
officials tried to learn the truth, the costs mounted,
Finally the investigation was completely dropped by
the county officials. The general feeling among
-most of the area was one of anger and disgust,
There was the familiar talk among them that some
of the officials must have been in with the crooks;
others said the reason the officials were opposed
to any further investigation was that perhaps the
detective got too close to some of their friends,

No one really knew.

Judge A. H,. Christensen hired the detective
to go on with his investigation independent of the
county officials. He was not anxious to have the
criminals behind bars for vengeance sake but to
assure that there would be no repetition of the
same and that his brothers and sisters and their
families could be left alone and safe to pursue
their normal living at The Oasis. After several
more weeks, however, reports and accounts be-
came so contradictory and garbled and rumors so
irresponsible that the detective was dismissed
and the investigation closed after six months in all.

We can't help but believe that most members
of the various Christensen families, if not all, were
<span id="page-??"></span>
44] Wyoming Interlude

greatly relieved to have this chapter of their lives
ended, The notoriety brought on by this investiga-
tion must have been extremely distasteful to these
modest people who were anything but publicity
seekers, But with the end of the investigation
came the end of the dream for the great estate on
The Oasis for the Christensen brothers and sisters,
The dream must have begun to dim the day their
oldest brother, Christian, died. It wasn't long
before his family sold out their interests to Louis
and left the area. Elsie and her children left
before long to rejoin their husband and father in
making a new home, Elvena and her husband went
back to Utah to live, The girls realized little if
anything from their homesteads, which were
eventually sold for taxes, Andrew failed to prove
up on his property there so lost it in the long run.
Louis and his family were the only ones who con-
tinued to live in Wyoming. But though he continued
to retain a good share of The Oasis, he went into
law enforcement as a profession, being elected to
the office of Uinta County Sheriff for several terms
and finally being appointed to the position of State
Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Wyoming's
Governor, Nellie Taylor Ross, first woman gover-
nor in the United States. So The Oasis dream dis-
appeared for the Christensens, but with the swift -
changing years new dreams, new hopes, new
opportunities and fresh challenges took its place
for all of them. ,

9. TIME'S HOURGLASS

After the last rites and burial. for their eldest
son Christian, age fifty, were ended, Laurs and
Else gathered with many of their descendants at
the red brick home in North Gunnison, then owned
by their youngest son and his wife, Arthur and
Millie, Of course Arthur and Millie and their
children, Melrose, Wesley, Grace, Gladys and
David, were all there, as were Joseph, Roxie and
their offspring, Harold, Ruth Ellen, Myron, Virgil,
Marvin and nine-months-old Don, Andrew and
Sarah had come up from the LaVerkin area in
southern Utah's Dixie with their entire family,

then including Edith, Wendell, Sheldon, Luther
and Lucile; while Albert had come from Manti,
bringing with him his five motherless children,
Virginia, Elaine, Sherman, Hale and Phillip.
Emma and Charles and their three children,
Byron, Ada and Imelda were all present. Louis
and Florence had brought all their seven with
them from Wyoming, LaFaun, Lucien, Rex,
Dale, Weldon, Alice and baby Rose, six months
old and youngest of the group, With Louis and his
family were guests from Lyman, Wyoming, Bishop
Clarence Rollins, who had spoken at the funeral,
and his daughter Ada.

Caroline and her children, Pearl, Elmer,
Roy, Ivy, Farrald and Gordon, were not in atten-
dance at this Christensen family gathering, for
they had left as soon as possible after the services
to return to their home in Salt Lake City. Elsie
and her five youngsters, A, Owen, Edgar, Clifton,
Edith and Ellamae, had also left right away to
return to Wyoming, and Vena had gone back with
them since her husband George had been unable to
accompany her to Gunnison and she undoubtedly
wished to rejoin him as soon as possible,

Laurs and Else and the others were likely
disappointed at not getting them to stay for the
taking of a family group picture. But they went
ahead with the picture nevertheless, all of those.
present standing out in front of the red brick house,
Laurs and Else both looked their full seventy years,
for Christian's death had been a great shock to
them. Most looked sad or thoughtful in the picture
that was taken that 12th of October 1917, but Aunt
Roxie's sweet face coming up like a full moon over
Grandfather's shoulder helped to brighten it up
some, It must have been hard to realize at.the
time that it had been ten whole years since their.
last family group picture had been taken. There
were a number of new faces on this one - but some
were missing, and not just. because they had not
stayed to be taken.

We can imagine that part of the discussion
carried on among the adults at this gathering was
concerning their getting together oftener. Life
was so uncertain and time so precious and it

moved along so rapidly. In seventy years one had
only 25, 000 days and 600, 000 hours to use and
cherish. There was no time to waste on useless
and shoddy things, only time for the best; and
what could be better than for a family to spend it
together enjoying each other while yet there was
time in which to do it? They talked of having a
family reunion the very next summer and likely

a committee was appointed to plan it and all
pledged to be present, And then they separated,
each family going its way, doubtless with renewed
resolve at léast to see their dear progenitors more
often and to keep in touch and cheer them on in
their declining years.

A month and a half later, 29 Nov. 1917,
Laurs went into the Manti Temple and did the
endowment work in behalf of his beloved son
Christian, Six days after that, 5 Dec, 1917,
Caroline and five of her living children went with
Laurs and Else to the Salt Lake Temple. Here
Caroline had her own endowments that day and
Else did the same work for the deceased Elora,
Then all of Christian's and Caroline's family, both
the living and the dead, were sealed together for
eternity, all but Pearl, and Laurs stood for
Christian while Else stood for Elora, Those on
the other side must have rejoiced on that occasion,
and those on this side of the veil who understood
rejoiced too,

Elvena (Vena) came back to her parents!
home in Manti to have her first baby. Her mother
Else took care of her, She was past thirty-one
years old and according to Tresia she had a very
hard time. The little girl was born 12 July 1918
and was given the name Vera, Vena was not yet
up and around when the Christensens began gather-
ing for their family reunion, nor was she able to
join to any extent in the festivities, We do not
know if George was able to come, but probably
not as he was usually with the herds of the Bennion
Livestock Company, and with a new member in the
family to provide for felt unable to miss his work
and the income it provided.

This family reunion was quite an affair,

we are fortunate to be able to copy:-- "Sat. July 19,

where Bob Blackner sang 'Sunshine of Your Smile'
and 'Somewhere a Voice is Calling'. Then the men

grandest meeting. There were tears in everybody's

rumored that in Europe the ''war to end all wars",
the worst war, the bloodiest war in history, was
almost over, Soon it was all over over there and
the boys were coming home! Cheering, flag
waving crowds, with bands playing, were at
hundreds of railroad stations throughout the

length and breadth of the United States to welcome
home their heros. Cousin Elmer Christensen,
Christian’ and Caroline's eldest son, was among
those to return from the First World War. Though
he joined the service not too long before the end of
hostilities and didn't get into the actual fighting,
he was however, as far as we can learn, the only
one of Laurs' and Else's descendants to get into it
at all, How thankful they must have been when the
threat was at last ended,

Though Laurs and Else had kept up occa-
sional correspondence with their loved ones in
Denmark ever since their return from there in
1910, this had been almost entirely disrupted
during the war and for some time after. They —
wrote again when the great war was over, and in
April 1920 received two letters from Jutland in
return; one from Else's sister Marie and one
from her sister Karen, A translation of each
follows:- -
"Skovlyst 21, Thisted, Denmark

26 Mar. 1920

"Dear Loved Ones:

"Thanks for the letters we received, they
are passed around among us, Mikkel and Karen
were here and Karen read the card for me while
I rested on the sofa, I have to rest my legs since
their support is not always strong. But I will say
thanks to my Father in Heaven that I can still move
about and take care of myself. I cannot stretch
my strength as far as you can but I am happy and
contented and I receive a little more to live on and
this is good as everything is so expensive.

"Our sister Stine died the 18 March (1920)
and was buried the 23 March. I believe she was
not as satisfied spiritually as could be desired,
Of course it can come to both old and young. But

now she is released from the earthly life and we
are sure she departed in the belief of the three-
in-one God (Trinity). We have heard so little
about them since, but it was pneumonia which

took her life. She couldn't stand it with her asthma.
The doctor that came also knew she couldn't live.
It was strange that she should be so far away from
us when the end came, but she had it good with her
husband and children and the new house that was
being built for them in Frederikshaven. While it
was being built she and Swend were living with
their children in Copenhagen, where she died.

"Their oldest son, Holger, is a carpenter,
married and with two children, a boy and a girl,
Their happy youngest daughter, 'Stinne' is married
to a trolly-car operator, a nice man from Fyn.
They have three delightful children, two boys and
a girl. Viggo is director of an association of com-
panies and Dagmar is the secretary. They have
extended themselves completely out economically.

"Old Mrs, Vagner, born Jessen, is still
living. She has been so near death and is so feeble
but is up and around again. She has been to see
sister Stine, They lived together awhile many
years ago. I used to visit her once in awhile.
She's poor now though she was an only daughter
from Lyngholm and a grocer's widow. We are
so much better off, we children of Anders Kristjan
the houseman, Yes, father did well - long live his
memory,

"Yes dear sister, you can be sure we Danish
pray and hope for our brothers and sisters of the
southland. The Germans can continue to be, as
Gruntdvig said in his talk, ‘our burden,' That is
true, but we believe true and fast that everything
stands in God the Father's hands and in that belief
we live and are happy.

"Our Edel is happy. She has a daughter and
son, Iam going to travel there in April and hold
Easter in Jesus' name; Thousands of Greetings.
Marie"

"Dear Sister:

447 Time's Hourglass

"Right at first, many thanks for being so
kind to write to us; it is a great joy to us, I have
now read Marie's letter to you and see that she
has written about what we know of sister's sick-
ness and death,

"About the first part of March Viggo and
Aksel Poulsen, who live in Aarhus, were here
for a visit and Vigo said at the time that 'mother
is becoming better than father.' So it was a sur-
prise for us when we saw Stine's death announced
in the newspaper. We decided we would not send
a letter to you until we knew something about her
last days.

"April lst, Dear Sister:-- We have now had
a letter from Svend and that we are all happy and
thankful for, Sister was not real sick for more
than eight days, The Dr, was there on Wednesday
and he said that she would have to have someone
with her, That was taken care of and so she lay
and had it good, Dagmar was with her and layed
down in Svend's bed and they talked together for
one hour before Stine passed away, which we
have very much to be thankful for.

"Sister Marie was here for Easter and we
had it very good in spite of what disrupts both in
and out of our little land, I think that you cer-
tainly know the latest happenings in Copenhagen,
Yes dear sister I was better to write this time;
of course there was enough to write about, I will
with words say that all in the family have it good,
Herewith will I bid you farewell, and may God's
peace be with you all, --Karen Skarrup."'

Alas, separations come and all must travel
the way of death, Though last partings are
grievous, none can escape them, There is an
earthly end to everything, both bad and good and
sooner or later every living body must lie down
to sleep the exhausted sleep of the dead for a time.
So Ane Kirstine ''Stine'' Andersen Poulsen had
passed on at seventy-one years five months and

anniversary festival held years before in honor of
Stine and Svend. They went like this;--

"Svend Poulsen, the bridegroom, came to work
on Mikkel Skaarup's farm.

He came not with sword but with axe on his
shoulder and a saw in his hand,

He was a fine worker and smiled a lot.

Stine Andersen, the bride, had a courageous,
loving heart

And a happy, pleasant nature.

These two met, but how they met and fell
in love

Only they themselves know,'' -- yes, there
had been happier days!

In Zion on 23 June that year 1920, the son
Albert married again after almost four years as
a widower, He was forty-seven and a half and his
bride was nearly thirty-five. The two, Miss
Myrtle Farnsworth a successful teacher in the
Manti High School, and Albert, chose the beautiful
St. George Temple in which to be wed, The
mothering of his five children was a great challenge
and Myrtle was worthy and capable in every way.
She took over the responsibilities as wife and
mother with optimism and great couwage and
brought love and devotion, encouragement and
great strength into the home. Besides she was
an excellent seamstress, a marvelous cook and
a splendid housekeeper, Good stepmothers are
not easily found but she was one of the best,

"Aunt Myrtle'', as many of us lovingly call
her, is the only one of our Christensens of the
second generation living at this writing (1969). She
will soon turn eighty-four and is still a strength
and inspiration to us all, not only her.own children
and theirs, but us stepchildren and ours, There
has been no line of distinction drawn between us as
far as we can tell, Aunt Myrtle well remembers
her father and mother-in-law, Laurs and Else,
and admires them greatly, although she found Else
a little hard to get acquainted with at first. She
related this little incident about her.

One day, not long after she had taken up her
<span id="page-??"></span>
449 Time's Hourglass

duties as housewife inthe Albert Christensen
home, she was washing dishes and using a new
styled wire dish-dryer in which to dry them, con-
sidering this more sanitary than the old dishtowel
method besides being a real time saver, Else
came to call at that moment and stood inthe kitchen
doorway watching this operation, hands on hips.
Finally she said, ''Sarah has von of doze', Myrtle
replied, 'Yes I know; she saw mine and liked it so
well that she got herself one right away.'' Else
stood looking for awhile and then she stated very
positively, ''Vell me, I vill alvays vipe my dishes!"
There was no "beating around the bush" with Else
K. She called a spade a spade and an axe an axe.
One always knew where she stood.

In the meantime Laurs and Else went on
with their temple work for their dead kinfolk, In
June of 1921 she was privileged to do the work for
her dear departed sister Stine in the Manti Temple,
She likely hoped to outlive her other sisters and
her brother Mads in order to be able to do the
same for them when their time came. They were
all still living the last of April 1922, when a letter
was sent to Laurs and Else from Denmark, by
Mads' youngest daughter, Edel Hvid. FoHowing
is a translation of the same:--

"Tingstrup, Thisted, Denmark
29 April 1922

"Dear Aunt and Uncle:

"Thanks for your long, dear letter which we
were all so happy to read, Aksel is going to take
a trip home in the month of June when it is Uncle
and Aunt, Mikkel and Karen Skaarup's yellow |
(golden) wedding anniversary festival, This is.

a little late to send you an invitation but it would
be fine if you could come and surprise them on
this day. It is the longest day of the year (21
June) but you remember that of course - your
memory is good, .

"T will tell you a little about father's birth-
day the nineteenth of last March. The day began -
with delightfully calm, mild weather and sun the
whole day. We had five guests for dinner, We
had first soup with dumplings and then ox steak
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 450

(beef steak) and fried chicken, potatoes, yellow
root (carrots), red cabbage, red beets, preserves,
and pudding for dessert, At 2 o'clock in the after-
noon came the family in the Hurup car, There were
nine of them altogether so there was a big party
here, We drank chocolate and coffee. By evening
there were eighteen of us,

"The day after came our aunts, Karen and
Marie, They stayed awhile in the afternoon, By
then it had become so cold and had snowed and
frozen and it has been very cold ever since, Here
there is nothing by way of crops although we are
well along in the season, Late congratulations on
your birthday! I can remember Elvena writing to
me that it was her birthday the 27th of last month,
I hope this letter will get to you in time to let you
know of Uncle and Aunt Skaarup's wedding festival.

"Father was very sick one time during this
last winter. He had influenza and a heat rash, but
now he is completely well again. He became
seventy-seven years old, so of course he is not
wholly young any longer. We say thanks to the
good God for the time that goes. I hope you are
all well. Happy Easter! And loving greetings to
you all from Denmark and the Hvid family. --Edel
Hvid. P.S. -- Iwas so pleased to receive the
newspaper,."'

Yes, it was good that: Karen and Mikkel
could celebrate their golden wedding together; not
all were so fortunate - Stine and Svend for instance.
But of course Laurs and Else could not go to the
celebration. Their days of travel to far-off
Denmark were over. Perhaps someday others of
their descendants would want to go there. They
too had had their 50th wedding anniversary back
in April of 1916, but they had no special celebration
then, With so many of their family moving to
Wyoming about that time it probably just ''got lost
in the shuffle,"'

The end of the year of 1922 Laurs got word
from Denmark of the death of his brother Christen
there on Nov. 27th. Now all of the family of his
youth was gone but him, It was a strange feeling
to be the last leaf left fluttering on the family tree.
<span id="page-??"></span>
45] Time's Hourglass

How very lonely such a man must be who had no
companion or children of his own, How grateful
he was for Else and their many descendants!

v sh y y
Ed 3K K Bg 3K

Else decided to travel and visit all of their
children. Laurs was busy helping various ones
in Gunnison with their harvests, They were always
good to look after him when Else was away. The
decision made, Else K, set out and started her
visiting in Gunnison with Emma, Charles and their
three youngsters, Then she spent a little time
there with Arthur and Millie, who now had five,
the youngest, Max, soon three years old, Joseph
and Roxie always welcomed Grandma at their place.
They still had their four youngest boys at home,
Harold and Ruth Ellen were married but both lived
in Gunnison, Else was able to get a look at four of
her great-grandsons while there, for Harold and
his wife Herma had three little boys, the youngest,
Clair, not more than ten days old, and Ruth Ellen
and her husband, Frank Hansen, had little Duane,
fourteen and a half months old.

Then Else went to Goshen where Elsie and
Elvena and their families lived. Elsie and Alma
now had six living children, three sons and three
daughters, LaPreal, now two and a half years old,
having been their first child in almost nine years,
Elvena was expecting her fourth baby and her
mother Else must have been real anxious to get
to Goshen in time for it so that she could be on
hand to help with the three little girls, Vera, Alta
and Tresia, until Vena could be up and around
again,

Else likely went from there to Salt Lake City
in time to attend some of the sessions of the
General October Conference, Heber J. Grant was
President of the Church then, She and Laurs had
lived under the administrations of Brigham Young,
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow,
Joseph F, Smith, and now Heber J. Grant, and
known and loved them all. This trip she spent
most of her time with her children and their
families however, Andrew and Sarah now had the
six children living, three boys and three girls,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 452.

like Elsie and Alma. Their Edythe had recently
returned from two years of study in Boston.

Else also spent time visiting Caroline and
her children, those who were around, while there.
Pearl, of course, she had likely seen in Goshen,
Elmer and Roy were out of the state, working.
Roy in particular was a great help to his mother
in those days in assisting with the support of the
family. Too much can not be said of the faithful-
ness of this boy in behalf of his widowed mother.
Farrald says the family would have had great
difficulty making out if it hadn't been for the finan-
cial assistance of this older brother during those
trying times, and in fact as long as their mother
lived, The three younger children were then at
home attending school and Caroline was able to
spend some time working in the Salt Lake Temple,
which she liked to do, Perhaps Else went through
a session with her while there, as she often did.

Wyoming was Else's next destination for she
had promised Florence she would come and do
some quilting for her, Cold weather was coming
on and Wyoming was well known for its cold
winters, Lewis and Florence were then living in
a fine home in Evanston, where he was still county
sheriff, and doing well. They now had eight living
children, baby Marjorie being two months past a
year. But they also had a grandson, since LaFaun
was married to Benjamin Slagowski and had a five
months old son Louis, Else got to see her fifth
great-grandson while in Evanston, for LaFaun
came from Lyman, where they were living, to
show him off, She and Laurs as yet had no great-
granddaughters, She stayed several weeks in
Evanston. It was quite a long ways away and she
didn't hope to be able to get there very often in
the future.

When the first of November came Else had
had her visit out and was eager to be on her way
home, She had seen most of her descendants, as
well as numerous old friends, and she wanted to
get back to Manti in time to vote in the coming
special election, The train may have seemed to
run slowly.to Else, homeward bound, for there
would be Laurs to greet and tell the news to, and
<span id="page-??"></span>
453 Time's Hourglass

there was much of that. Albert's family also
would be in Manti to welcome her. And when she
neared the end of her journey and looked out of the
window of the Rio Grande train on which she
traveled, and saw the majestic Manti Temple on
the hill overlooking snow covered Sanpete Valley,
her heart must have welled up and almost cried
out loud, ''Home Sweet Home'', She had been
away so long - she was lonesome for the patient,
faithful, ever-loving Laurs! :

Albert's family was mostly at home, although
Virginia was married to Daniel M, Keeler and
living in Provo, where she was expecting her first
baby in the spring. Elaine was teaching in the
High School at Manti. Albert's and Jennie's three
boys were at home and he and Myrtle now had two
little ones of their own, the boy Cullen, two anda
half years old, and the baby girl, Mable Norma,
six and a half months, Else visited with them a
little while on her way from the station, She felt
better acquainted with Myrtle now than at first. |
She confided in her the fact that she had had "'an .
axe to grind''for several years and that she had
taken care of that on this journey. Then she told
her about that Danish friend of hers, sister so-and-
so, who had remarked to her some years before ;
Vena had married, "Ja, but Vena you vill haf.
alvays vit you", ''I vent to visit this friend on the
way home from my trip", said Else with a trium-
phant smile in her eyes, "and ven she asked about
my children, and Vena in particular and if she vas
vell, Isaid to her, 'Ja, ja - and Vena now has
four beautiful datters!'' Yes indeed, Else K. was
in excellent spirits when she returned from her
trip. . Soe
It was election day the day Else came back
and she went to the polls and cast her vote, and :
this turned out to be the final public act of her
earthly career, Within a week she had contracted
a cold which gradually went down into her lungs
and turned to pneumonia. She was seriously ill
for only three days, Her children were notified
and those near at hand came to do what they could.
The wife of the tailor next door, Sister Petersen,
who was a nurse as well as a very close friend
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 454

and neighbor, offered her services, and, working
under the direction of the doctor who was sum-
moned, did everything she possibly could for her
desperately ill friend.

But Else K, Christensen passed away Monday
night, 19th Nov. 1923, It was a shock to all who
knew her, Sister Petersen laid her out, with the
kind assistance of other sisters of mercy. One of
their last services at the time was to wash Else's
long, heavy head of gray auburn- streaked hair,
and partially dry it and then leave it hanging down
from her head at the end of the table where she
was laid, to complete the drying before she could
be dressed in her burial clothes,

We have heard it said that sometimes spirits
hover around their dead bodies until they are
finally laid in mother earth to rest, to make sure
all goes well. Indeed stranger things have been
told. A couple of nights after Else's body had been
laid out there in her home in Manti she appeared to
Sister Petersen in a dream or visitation, She said
nothing but seemed to be disturbed and kept rubbing
the back of her neck, Sister Petersen felt strange
and puzzled about it and the next morning went next
-door to the Christensen's to look at the body. Of
course she lifted the long hair hanging almost to
the floor and looked at the neck of the corpse. She
found that someone had left a damp towel rolled
between the hair and the neck, keeping things from
drying out there. Decomposition was beginning to
set in and this had to be taken care of right away.
Some may find this hard to believe but it was told
to members of the family by Sister Petersen herself,

The Manti Messenger carried an account of
Grandmother's death under the heading of ''Else K.,
Christensen", as follows:-- 'Passing quietly away
at her home last Sunday night (Monday) Mrs, Else
Cathrine Christensen ended peacefully a 76 year
career of active service, 'Do good to those in
need' seems to have been her guiding motto, for
a careful study of her history shows her activities
to have been directed along these lines. From her
earliest childhood she has been devoted to service.

she leaving her home and family for the sake of

that year, having endured the hardships of the

across the plains. They moved to Gunnison from
Manti and then became associated with the United
Order at Mayfield, later moving back to Gunnison
where they spent many years, Later they moved
to Manti, then to Salt Lake briefly (?) then back
to Manti, which has been their home since, They
reared nine children to maturity and two foster
children; they have 54 living grandchildren and
five great-grandchildren,

"Mrs, Christensen has been a devoted
mother to her family, wife to her husband, and
ever ready to give service to her church and to
those in need, She was the first doctor nurse
Gunnison Valley had, She served in the Relief
Society both as an officer and teacher and in the
Primary Association, She was chosen at one
time as a delegate to represent the Republicans
of this county in a State convention in Salt Lake,
She has been especially devoted to the gathering
of her genealogy and has a record back to the
fifteenth century, She has made two trips back
to her native land, once alone and once with her
husband, to gather genealogy and has devoted years
of service in the temple to work for her dead rela-
tives and friends, She is survived by her husband
and the following children: Andrew B., Salt Lake;
Joseph C., Arthur M. and Mrs, Emma E, Peter-
son, Gunnison; Albert H,, Manti; Mrs. Elsie K.
Bartholomew and Mrs, Elvena Clark, Goshen;

"A large group of mourners gathered at the
tabernacle last Friday to pay respects to Mrs,
L. M. C. Christensen, The services were con-
ducted by Bishop's Counselor Alphonso Henrie.
The choir sang 'Come, Come Ye Saints', Mr,
and Mrs, E, E, Johnson sang a duet, Miss
Christy Parry sang a solo, and Miss Helen Fikstad
and the choir sang 'Come Ye Disconsolate', The
speakers were Simon Christensen, Peter Sorensen
of Ephraim, N. R. Peterson, Pres, A, E, Park
of Gunnison, and Temple Pres, L. R. Anderson,'!

The account of Grandmother's death, life
and burial as taken from the Gunnison Gazette at
the time is also recorded here:

"Pioneer Woman is Called to Reward

"Else K, Christensen, beloved wife of
L. M. C. Christensen, and well known throughout
Gunnison Valley and the entire county, passed to
the great beyond at her home in Manti last Monday
night at 12 o'clock, Death followed a three-day
serious illness and notwithstanding the fact that
she was very ill she was conscious and realized
that the end was near and bade all those about her
farewell. The husband, and Joseph and Albert,
sons, and a daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and
Mrs. Chas, Peterson, were at the bedside when
the end came.

"Mrs, Christensen just recently returned
from an extended visit to some of her children in
the northern part of the state and in Wyoming,
where she spent six weeks, and on her return
was well and in splendid spirits.

"The deceased was born in Denmark, Feb,
9, 1847, and had she lived until this coming Febru-
ary would have been 77 years old. When eighteen
years old she joined the L. D. S, Church and later
emigrated to America, settling first in Manti,
After a residence there for awhile she removed to
Gunnison and resided here for more than thirty
years, Some few years ago she returned to Manti
where she lived until called to the other world,
Mrs. Christensen was widely known and loved
always. In the early days she was the only trained
nurse in the entire valley, and through her charming

and loving ways and her efficiency in administer-
ing to the sick, she was highly esteemed and loved
by all.

"In her religious belief she was devout. For
thirty years she was an ardent worker in the Relief
Society and did much charity work, She was also
regarded as a very brilliant woman and before
coming to America, taught in the schoolsof her
native land. Since her residence at Manti she
has devoted her time to temple work, and her
time was occupied in this both at Manti and in
Salt Lake, Besides her husband and children she
leaves two sisters and a brother in Denmark,

"Funeral services have been arranged for
tomorrow, Friday, at one o'clock, Services will
be held at Manti and the body will be laid in its .
final resting place in the Manti Cemetery, "'

Yes, Grandmother Else K. Christensen was
laid to rest 23 Nov. 1923, in the Manti City Ceme-
tery, almost within the shade of the magnificent
Manti Temple which stands on the crest of the
once "Gray Hill", overlooking the valley, and in
which she had labored ardently and long for so .
many years for the salvation of others, Her grave
was placed on Albert's cemetery plot close to that
of his first lovely wife, Jennie. Some quite elab-.
orate funeral cards, similar to ones often used in
Old Denmark on such occasions, were printed
with Else K.'s name on and sent to her close rela-
tives in Denmark as a last farewell and keepsake
from her to them. (Cousin LaFaun has one of.
these in her possession)

Only a simple flat stone marker designates
the place of Else's resting, No fancy monument
marks the spot. Like the other noble mother
there beside her, her real monument is to be
found in the lives of her children and her children! s
children, even to the fifth generation.

THE MONUMENT

"Il asked her once, when I was young,
'Dear mother, are you great?

And will there someday be a stone
That will commemorate
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 458

The things you've done to help the world?'
My mother smiled at me,

‘You are my monument' she said,
‘And all the world will see |

In your kind deeds and in your life
The ideals of your mother,

You are my monument' said she,

‘I would not want another. '

So now I must stand straight and tall
And now I must be true | i
To all the dreams you had for me -
This monument to you,"

There are some people who, from the moment
you become conscious of them, you care about.
Suddenly they have something to do with your life.

If they succeed - you succeed; if they have a failure -
you fail to some degree. They wrap themselves
around your mind and heart, To me, Grandmother
Else K, was such a one! Softly she calls to me

over the years - even today. Tenuously her memory
clings. To be true to myself I have had to write of
her the things that I know and feel, One thing I feel
deeply is that in this earthly existence she gained

the approbation of an all wise and loving Heavenly
Father for her sacrifice and her faithfulness,
obedience and devotion to her Maker, and for her
great service to and her love and compassion for

his children - both the living and the dead, She

was a great soul, Sometimes I imagine I can

almost hear an echo of words coming from beyond
the veil - ''Well and beautifully done, Else K, !''

Grandfather Laurs went on with his life and
his temple work - one couldn't just stop in the
middle of things, Just weeks following Else's
death he did the work for his brother Christen,

He was more contented in the temple than most
any place then, His children who were living near,
Emma, Joseph, Arthur, Albert and their com-
panions were very considerate of him, as were
those who lived farther away. He often spent time
with them but he prefered to live mainly in his own

home and try and go on as before, But he was
lonely - there was no doubt about that! Being
naturally a rather quiet man himself, he missed
Else's humming at her work, the exuberance of
her conversation - her small talk - her soul talk;
and oh how he missed the comfort and strength of
her presence, Afterall, they had enjoyed more
than fifty-six and a half years together as man and
wife - mostly happy years in spite of hardships;
one didn't put aside a thing like that without longing.
But Laurs needed a companion - and he needed a
housekeeper,

One day in the Manti Temple he happened to
mention the latter to a widow whom he often met
and visited with there. In fact the two seemed to
be somewhat attracted to each other. Though
Laurs was half way joking about it at the time,
Sister Nielsen took him up on it right away and
practically popped the question herself (or so her
only daughter, Helga N. Larsen of Springville
seems to think it happened, ) Well why not?

So Laurs M. C. Christensen, widower of
seventy-seven years, and Sorena Boleta Thyrring
Nielsen, widow of nearly sixty-seven, went to the
County Court House at Manti and got a marriage
license and the same day, 21 Nov. 1924 went into
the Manti Temple and were married, for time only;
for Sorena was already sealed to her first husband
for eternity. Laurs shaved off the moustache he
had worn for many years and the new bride and
groom had their pictures taken together,

Sorena made Laurs a good housekeeper and
a splendid companion, She was of a very cheerful
nature and at times even a regular ''cut-up"., They
got along wonderfully together, She was extremely
attentive and good to him, She belonged to the
Scandinavian Choir there in Manti and was also
often featured on Danish programs as a Singer
and entertainer, Laurs was proud of her, She,
like Laurs, loved to dance. Byron telis of going
to. grandpa's house there on Union Street one day
after they were married, but it appeared that no
one was at home, Yet the house was unlocked and
he sensed that someone was there. He found
grandpa and Sorena in the basement dancing - they
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 460

were having a fine time. Sorena's son and daugh-
ter, by her first marriage, were pleased with
Laurs and they got along well together whenever
they had the opportunity to meet, Laurs' and
Else's children welcomed Sorena with open arms, -
"It is the best thing that could have happened to
father now'', they said, She responded with love
and treated them all as her own, The grandchildren
too were showered with her attention, as evidenced
by two beautiful ''star'! quilt tops she pieced and
sent to me as a token of affection.

Sorena, like Laurs, had been born in Denmark
and also came to Zion for the Gospel's sake, She
and a brother came over together, leaving parents,
family and friends. Much of her research remained
to be done, as well as her temple work, and Laurs
was able to help her a great deal with these, She
helped him with his also - and with Else's, When
he had word from Denmark of Else's sister Marie's
death, 7 Mar. 1925, and again of Else's sister
Karen's passing exactly a year and eight days later,
15 Mar. 1926, Sorena went to the temple and did
the work for them when their time was right.

But time passes and people get old. The one
who never grows old, ''Peter Pan", lives only in
'"Never-Never Land", The long hard school of life
began to close inon Laurs, He became ill of a
diabetic condition which settled in his toes and
gradually spread, He suffered a great deal for
many months. Excerpts from his son Albert's
recollections printed in ''The Hard Rich Soil", in
the form of letters mostly written to his son Sher-
man, tell much of his father's suffering in his last
days, as follows:--

"16 July 1928, Grandfather Christensen is:
quite ill. I'm afraid he won't be here long, He
would like to live he says, but if his time has
come he is ready to go. . . 4 Aug. 1928. Grand-
father Christensen is very ill and I don't know how
much longer the life forces can sustain him, He is
a wonderfully fine type of man, You may well be
proud of your grandfathers, . . 18 Aug. 1928.
Grandfather is still doing very poorly and he is
quite discouraged, Grandmother Christensen is
very fine to him and we all appreciate her. She is

entitled to a great deal of credit. She never spares
herself but waits on him constantly. . . 18 Sept.
1928. Grandfather is still doing very poorly, He
cannot move about and the days and nights seem so
long. He is in pain constantly, He prays contin-
uously to be released. He would like to pass away
as he feels no hope of recovery. . . 24 Sept. 1928,
Grandfather is still lingering on without getting
much better, if any at all. He is getting entirely
discouraged, It is too bad, the grand man that he
is and has been, that his last days should be so
full of pain and suffering, . . 15 Oct, 1928. Grand-
father is still very bad, in fact getting worse all
the time, and he would like to be relieved from his
misery. He cannot get well it seems and the sooner
he can pass the better, as he feels, Of course we
are doing all possible for him, Aunt Myrtle went
down the latter part of last week and she came
back yesterday. She says grandfather is very bad
and wants to die. He may, however, linger for a
month or more. . . 6 Nov. 1928. I stayed at
Grandfather's Sunday night and yesterday until
train time, He is in very bad condition, poor
dear; he is also having a very hard time and no
chance to get well. Under the conditions it would.
be a blessing if he could get relief. His mind is
as keen as lightning but his body is racked with
pain, Uncle Andrew went down to see him this ©
evening and I phoned Louis at Lyman, Wyoming
this morning that father wanted him to come down,
He promised that he would, ''..

Of course all of his cuindven ‘wanted to be
near him to give him the aid and comfort that they
could, Most of them came often, Even his foster
daughter, Tresia, and her husband Jim Lacy,. came
to see him before he passed away. Tresia tells
about how they had written her that Grandfather |
felt that if he could only get hold of some whisky
that this might bring about a cure. It had been
used to cure so many things in the early days when
Grandmother was practicing medicine, But Utah
had prohibition at that time and no whisky could be
had there, So they brought him some whisky
smuggled in from Montana, Grandfather was so.

that, but of course to no avail. The diabetic ulcers
were in their last stages,

Albert and his family were of course then
living in Orem, Utah. We continue with extracts
from his letters to his son Sherman: ''12 Nov,

1928, Grandfather Christensen passed away day
before yesterday about 1:30 o'clock P, M. and I

am here in Manti to assist in performing for him
the last earthly service we can, The funeral will
be held in the Center Ward Tabernacle here to-
morrow at 2 o'clock P.M. He will be laid away

on the south side of Grandmother - where he has
designated. He remained conscious until the very
last, It was a marvel to all how rapid and accurate
his mental facilities worked throughout his great
pain and suffering. Although unassuming, his mind
was of a very fine order and capable of an accurate
grasp of matters of general as well as particular
concern, ,, 14 Nov. 1928, Grandfather was given
a fine funeral, Many of his old friends and friends
of the family attended the services, The speaking,
singing and other music were excellent. All of his
living children were there except Louis from Lyman,
who could not come. Also many of his grandchildren
and some great-grandchildren were there. Phillip
was with me, (Aunt Myrtle and the small children
could not attend, being under quarantine still.) Ted
and Elaine were also at the funeral but Dan and
Virginia couldn't come."

In her history Laurs' and Else's oldest daugh-
ter, Elsie Bartholomew, wrote this account:--
"Death brought relief to Father on 10 Nov, 1928,,
nearly five years after mother's passing. He was
81 years 3 months and 19 days old when he died.
Funeral services were held in the Tabernacle or
Center Ward Chapel Tuesday afternoon 13 Nov.
1928. Many mourners from Manti, Gunnison
Valley and Mayfield attended. Speakers were
Simon Christensen, Bishop Brigham Jenson of
Centerfield, Bishop Niels R, Peterson of Manti,
and Patriarch J, Hatten Carpenter of Manti, with
closing remarks by Bishop Stott of the Manti Center
Ward, who presided. Three numbers were sung
by the choir - ''There is Sweet Rest in Heaven’,

vocal duet, 'The Morning', by Mr. and Mrs,

Ellis E, Johnson, President Jacobsen offered
the invocation and the benediction was by S, Peter
Peterson, He was buried beside mother in the
Manti Cemetery,"'!

Grandfather's second wife, Sorena, continued
to live on in the home in Manti, which she inherited,
for well onto ten years longer, Then she moved to
Springville and made her home with her daughter
Helga until she passed away. The following account
of her appeared in the Provo Herald Sun, 28 Mar,
1943, under the caption, ''Sorena Christenson" --
"Springville - Funeral services will be conducted
in the Fourth Ward Chapel this Sunday at 3 P.M.
for Mrs, Sorena T, Nielsen Christensen, 85, who
died Thursday night at the home of a daughter,

Mrs, Helga N, Larsen, with whom she had made
her home the past four years,

"Graveside services will be conducted at
Ferron, Utah at 1 P,M. Monday and burial will
be at Ferron, under the direction of A. Y. Wheeler
and Son Mortuary. Friends may call at the Larsen
residence, 140 East Third North in Springville
before the services Sunday,

"Mrs, Christensen was born in Denmark
Feb. 1, 1858, a daughter of Marton and Nikolana
Hansen Thyrring. At an early age she anda
brother came to Utah as converts to the L. D. S.,
Church, She lived at Ephraim for a number of
years and later moved to Salina. She has been an
ardent church worker, having been a Relief Society
teacher 45 years, and has also worked in the temple.

"Besides Mrs, Larsen she has a son,
Christian T. Nielsen of Ferron; also nine grand-
children and six great-grandchildren; a stepson,
Nick L, Nielsen of Homedale, Idaho, and two
sisters, Mrs, Eliza Nielsen and Mrs, Ella S,
Smith of California,"

Laurs of course outlived all the members
of the Christensen Company who came to Zion
together in 1866, besides his brother Christen
<span id="page-??"></span>
Time's Hourglass 464

and all of Else's people back in Denmark, except
perhaps her brother Mads Hvid, of whose death
we have no account, He also outlived all of
Christen and Anne's children, with the exception
of Caroline and ''Chris Krat''. Dear Patient,
sincere, devout and honest Grandfather Laurs.
Like his father, his word was as good as his bond,
His principles were the highest and his ideals most
noble. He was humble - yet dignified; full of good
humor - yet sensitive and sympathetic to the
greatest degree, He was a gentleman, a loving
husband and father, and he was a loved and
respected grandfather. We shall always cherish
his memory.

Here ends the story of Laurs and Else K.
Christensen as far as this book goes, We who
have followed them were born into a world quite
different from the one in which they lived and wove
their patterns of life. With their faith and works
they helped to build this new world for us and
future generations, It is a greater world, a more
exciting world than they were given. It is only
yesterday that our pioneer grandparents walked
the earth and did the work they chose to do. And
simply by doing well the things they did, with their
vision cast afar, they helped to provide for us and
ours greater opportunities than they themselves
had ever dreamed of, There have been more
changes since they passed away than in all other
times of written history put together. Could they
have visioned, when they sailed the seas in 1866
and walked across the plains to 'Zion Land", jet
liners traversing the skies from here to Denmark
in a matter of hours? From sagebrush to cement
and steel, from covered wagon to mooncraft, from
Pony Express to Telstar - these are but a few of
the changes that have taken place since yesteryear,

Truly, we ourselves may claim no honor, no
reward, no respect, special position, recognition
or credit because of what our grandparents were
or what they wrought. We can only set eternal
goals and try to emulate the greatness of their
characters and their devotion to service, and in
so doing bring lasting honor to their names, How
<span id="page-??"></span>
465 Time's Hourglass

we conduct ourselves is vastly important, for we
hold the future of the world in our hands, What
we do today, history will record tomorrow.

Yet each of us has so little time, as the
eternities of time are accounted. The wise wiil
charish it - the foolish waste it, For though it is
free, time is a relentless tyrant and takes its toll
in the long run, There is no time for shoddy
work - no time for non-essentials, The hourglass
of each life runs out too quickly.

"Help me to choose, O Lord,

From out the maze and multitude of things
that by me roll,

One thing to keep before me as a goal.

That when I die, my days may form for thee

Not many fragments - but one perfect whole, '"'

Laurs and Else K, Christensen were parents
of eleven children, including two pairs of twins.
One twin of each pair died soon after birth so are
not counted as branches on their family tree but
only as twigs, The remaining six boys and three
girls in this part of the book as the Nine Branches
of their Family Tree and the stories of their lives
appear in the order of their births, With few
exceptions these histories were written mainly by
various of their children, at the request of this
author, Brief accounts of each of their marriage
partners are also included, Two foster daughters,
partially raised by Laurs and Else, have something
about them recorded here as well. None of these
life histories are intended to be sophisticated bio-
graphies, for although they contain important and
interesting data they are more like heartfelt,
colorful, tender and even sometimes sad recollec-
tions about these whose graves we now tend and
who se memories we so fondly cherish,

(1) CHRISTIAN "I'! CHRISTENSEN

Christensen, was born Friday 4 Oct, 1867 in
Manti, Sanpete, Utah, during the raging of the
Black Hawk Indian War there, Perhaps he first.

the fierce beating of warning drums, Both his
father and paternal grandfather fought in that war
with others of the hard-pressed occupants of the
then eighteen year old settlement of his birth. He
was christened just plain Christian but in early
manhood he assumed the middle initial of 'I", He
was often called 'Chris" or "C, I."

At the age of three-and-a-half, the war being
over, young Christian moved with his Danish emi-
grant parents, a baby brother Andrew, and others
of his father's relatives, to a smaller settlement
some fifteen miles southwest of Manti, called
Gunnison. A short time after his seventh birthday
his parents joined the ''United Order" and moved
five or six miles southeast of Gunnison to the very
small United Order community of North Mayfield,
taking Chris and his then three younger brothers
with them. The account of their circumstances and
experiences in the "Order'! and later in South May-
field, have been given in some detail in another
chapter.

It was in Mayfield, we remember, that Chris
first attended school. His daughter Pearl tells of
this:-- ''Christian had very little chance for an
education in school but he was taught by his mother,
at her knee, while she was spinning, carding or
doing other household duties. She, having had a
fine education, taught him so well that when he did
enter school for the first time he was placed in the
sixth grade. He studied very hard and had an
excellent memory. It was in Mayfield also that
Christian suffered the long-lasting and severe eye
infection which threatened to destroy his sight and
might have, had it not been for the constant efforts,
faith and prayers of his loving parents, grand-
father Christensen, and other concerned relatives,
Instead, however, he was left with a "happy tear"!
for life. Doubtless it was the persistence of this
eye infection that kept the boy from entering school
earlier. It was in Mayfield, too, that Christian
was baptized a member of the L, D. S, Church,
This took place on his tenth birthday and his
mother recorded it in her journal like this:--
"Christian Christensen, dobt den 4 October 1877 i
May Field, dobt of Henry Jensen.'' His younger
<span id="page-??"></span>
469 Christian

brother Andrew, four months past eight, was bap-
tized the same day, and by the same Henry Jensen,
Counselor to Bishop O. C, Olsen of Mayfield.

When Chris was going on thirteen the family
sold their home in South Mayfield and moved back
to Gunnison. His father leased a farm in Christen-
burg, midway between Mayfield and Gunnison.

Here he and his boys farmed and the family lived
for anumber of summers. Christian was a great
help on the farm for he had started farming young.
Pearl tells of this:-- ''When Christian was about
six, he started to help his father on the farm. He
also herded a few sheep and cows on the flats in
Mayfield, Gunnison and later in Christenburg.

Many a day he skipped off with a smile, humming
the tunes he had heard his mother hum and sing to
him. He would carry a lunch tied up in a knapsack
on a stick over his shoulder. Most of the time this
lunch consisted of a slice or two of homemade bread
and a slice of baconor salt pork; and on his way
he'd go, never complaining. He learned very early
in life the value of thrift and industry and he learned
to love and appreciate nature and the out-of-doors."

Pearl continues;-- ''While living in Christen-
burg the Christensen children played with the Ole
Larsen children next door, Ole Larsen and Laurs
Christensen freighted together many atime. The
children would walk or ride to Gunnison each week
to Sunday School, Primary and Religion Class,
Christian became attracted to Caroline Larsen
while living there and the two became childhood
sweethearts.

"At age fourteen Christian started working
for the man from whom they had leased their farm
in Christenburg, Julius Christensen, with his sheep
and cattle; for Mr. Christensen was a large sheep-
and stock-owner as well as a land-owner. He soon
gave young Chris heavy responsibilities, for he
knew he was trustworthy. At age nineteen he was
put in charge of the sheep herds for his employer
and worked on shares, which gave Chris a chance
to put in so many sheep for himself each year.
This went on for several years.'' His brother
Albert, during some of this time, was employed
by Julius Christensen to run what was called his
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 470

‘South Farm" or ranch in Christenburg. He tells
about receiving help from Chris there:-- ''My

oldest brother, Chris, was my employer's foreman
over his sheep outfits, but in June when the alfalfa
was ready to cut and put up, he came down to the
ranch to help with the hay. Later he helped with

the grain which was all loaded and stacked by hand,"

The year of 1888-89 Albert was given employ-
ment with Julius Christensen's herds, under super-
vision of his brother Chris, He tells something of
their experiences in "The Hard Rich Soil", from
which we quote:-- ''That spring I went to work for
my old employer. Iwas with the sheep, a lambing
herd which lambed on the east slope of the Wasatch
Range about due east of the southernmost part of
Sanpete County. The sheep were ranged in about
the same vicinity until the first part of October 1888.
-Ihad charge of one of the two large herds then owned
by Mr. Christensen. That fall my employer came
to me and asked me if I would continue to work for
him during the winter. He said if I would stay with
him for one year he would pay me as high a wage as
any man he had, except his foreman, Chris. That
-was $30 per month; Chris received $35 per month.

"Our long trip with the sheep was commenced
late in October. The herds moved through the
southern part of Sanpete County, across part of ©
Sevier County and up to Grass Valley in Piute
County, thence south past what is now known as
"Bryce Canyon' and from there down to a place
then known as 'Loseyville", but now called ''Tropic"'.
We camped a little north of Loseyville on a creek,
We-had arrived at the campsite about dark. We
bedded the sheep near the trail and pitched our |

camp in a sandy flat on the east bank of the stream.
Rain poured down during the night, From our
-campsite, north and east, the ground gradually
rose for about half a mile and then the country
broke off into the valley. We could see the sheep
apparently feeding along this slope through the
forenoon, so we stayed in camp, drying our bedding
and clothing. The other herd had passed on ahead,
My brother Chris, foreman of that herd, was stay-
ing with me and intended to move on the next day.

"After dinner I started out to go around the
<span id="page-??"></span>
471 Christian

herd, I discovered to my dismay that what had
appeared to be feed was a worthless red weed and
what held the sheep down was a plaster-of-paris
type of clay that gathered on and stuck to their feet,
When a sheep would succeed in extricating one foot
from this clay its other three feet would stick fast,
I notified my brother Chris of this condition and
together we went around the herd. We found that

a considerable number of the sheep had crossed
over into the swale, or valley, to the east. We
also found that a considerable number had moved
on to the west, They were in clay up to their sides,
We drove what sheep we could back to camp, where
the ground was more firm, then we attempted to
lift the other sheep out of the mud and place them
on firmer ground. We soon discovered that our
own feet would sink into the ground and when a

foot was pulled out the boot would remain fastened,
It was about dark when we got all of the mired sheep
back to firmer ground,

"The next day we worked the marooned sheep
over to a small hill where we had to leave them for
three or four days before we could get them back
with the rest of the herd, One of our burros got
into the clay up to her sides. We seemed unable
to get her out; so, rather than leave her in the mud
to die, we put a chain around her neck and attached
a team of horses to pull her out. To our astonish-
ment she came through the ordeal comparatively
unscathed. While she was useless until spring,
she later assumed her usual burdens. This was
the way we celebrated my sixteenth birthday, Dec.
13, 1888. (Chris was twenty-one)

"After the herd moved away from the mud
country we moved along leisurely. . . The winter
was quite severe. Along about February we were
forced to seek lower country. Feb. 28, 1889 was
one of the coldest nights Iwas ever out in. Several
sheep were frozen to death, The entire herd was
so cold that it failed to leave the bed-ground until
about noon of the following day. We moved down
into what was locally called 'Death Valley''. Day
after day came and went. Iwas up at daylight,
had breakfast, followed the sheep out onto the
range, generally came back to camp for luncheon,
<span id="page-??"></span>

then out with the sheep again. About sundown the
sheep would move slowly toward the bed-ground,
browsing as they went. Returning to camp, I would
make a fire and after I cooked supper and washed
dishes, I frequently read by campfire light. . . My
brother C, I, Christensen (Chris) was certainly a
grand brother and, I may say, a true companion to
me. He often came a long way just to stay with me
at night."

Yes, the life of a sheepherder could be a
lonely one, especially in winters, and it was not an
easy one at any time. But under this heavy respon-
sibility Christian grew strong in physique as well

as character. ''He was a tall, slender young man
with wavy brown hair and grey-blue eyes, but later
became heavy", says his daughter Pearl, ''He was

very self reliant, with usually a happy smile for
everyone - but he could be very strict and stern
when the case demanded, though he seldom used
strong language. When he was upset with someone
his favorite term for such a one was 'chump head!'
But on the whole Chris had a wonderful way with
men - he was a real leader. He was very persua-
sive, people had difficulty saying no to him. He
made friends easily. He loved people and he loved
music and he loved to sing and to dance. Some of
his favorite songs were 'Come, Come Ye Saints’,
'The Star Spangled Banner', 'What Will the Robin
Do Then, Poor Thing', and some favorite piano
numbers 'Pure as Snow', 'Shepherds Dream’, and
‘Shepherds Evening Song'.'' In fact it might be said
that Chris loved life, for he had so much that was
good to give to it.

He married his childhood sweetheart, Caro-
line Larsen, 28 Dec. 1893. Pearl continues:--
"They were married in Gunnison, with a wedding
reception being held at 4 o'clock in the afternoon
at the Larsen residence, They were very happy
and cherished each other all their lives. Caroline's
father gave them two beautiful horses for a wedding
present. One was a sorrel (Old Mormon) and the
other a bay mare (Beauty), Christian and Caroline
rented their first home, the old Tony King place,

a rock house on the east side of Gunnison, They
lived there for two years while they built their own
<span id="page-??"></span>
Their first and last home in Gunnison
<span id="page-??"></span>

home, which was about two blocks west of Main
Street, It was of white rock with five rooms and
was tastefully furnished and had handmade carpets
throughout, Imyself, their oldest child, was a
year old when we moved into this home,

"Soon after we moved in the folks planted
shade and fruit trees, berry bushes, flowers and
a garden on the place. Since father Christian was
away so much of the time, this left a lot of respon-
sibility to mother Caroline'', An amusing incident
is told by their eldest son Elmer, in regard to his
father's long absences from home:-- 'When I was
young, father was away most of the time with the
sheep and later, when I was at the ranch or with
the sheep myself, he wasn't there with me either,
I remember one time while I was real young and
we were still living in Gunnison, he came home
one spring after having been out on the desert all
winter. His whiskers were long and red and I
didn't know who he was. When he came over and
kissed mother Iwas shocked. After he left I told
her I was going to tell father that she let that man
with the red whiskers kiss her, but she only laughed.
After. father came back from the barber shop with
the red whiskers all gone, of course I recognized
him and told himabout the red whiskered stranger
kissing mother - he sure got a kick out of that!"

Pearl writes: "Christian's employer, Julius
Christensen, died while still quite young, but Chris
was asked to continue working for his company until
they sold out, which left him with all the major
responsibilities for quite some time. But he was
equal to it. After the company sold out, Chris was
left with quite a few sheep of his own. Later he
bought a few more and then went into the sheep
business with Lafe Bown, also of Gunnison. This
partnership lasted for many years and was most
successful,

"Lafe and Christian ran their sheep up
Twelve Mile canyon in summers and on the west
desert in winters, Their company owned a sepa-
rating corral south of Fayette, where they
separated their sheep both spring and fall,
Christian spent many a cold, hard winter going
back and forth on the west desert with the sheep.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian A474

He usually traveled in his buckboard. He would
put hot rocks in the bottom of it to keep his feet
warm and usually he had heavy wool-filled quilts
around him to keep out the cold. Many times he
would drive all night to keep a promised appoint-
ment. Sometimes he would have to camp by a fire
or under a cedar tree until it was light enough to
find his way. There was little travel on the desert
in winter and the going was slow, A trip that would
take eight to ten days at that time in a wagon or
buckboard can now be made in four or five hours
in a car and forty-five minutes by plane,

"Christian and Lafe Bown had dependable
men that would help them with the sheep, which
left them free for their other interests when
necessary, Christian's two younger brothers,
Louis and Arthur, worked for him alot. Besides
his sheep and cattle he had a farm on the west side
of Gunnison at a place called Clarion. There was
always a job to be done there and elsewhere, with
harvesting of crops, threshing getting flour,
potatoes and meat in for the winter, and also wood.
Besides his own wood supply he hauled extra for
needy families and widows, He paid his tithing
with such farm products as grain, hay, wheat,
flour or cattle,

"The winters with him away seemed long but
the summers were wonderful. Father and our
family, Lafe Bown and his family, and other friends
and relatives spent many happy summers up Twelve
Mile Canyon together. We went riding, hiking,
picking wild flowers and berries. We made swings
for grown ups and for children and we made large
bonfires to gather 'round in evenings for fun, with
singing and dancing. A favorite hike was up
Musinia Peak by foot or horseback. Good old sour
dough bread and plenty of mutton chops cooked over
the open fire or on a camp stove was the food we
liked best." : en

The sheep business paid off for Chris in
those days and he was able to save quite a bit of
money. Among other things, he was most generous
in helping his brothers and sisters get the schooling
which he himself had been denied, He was indeed
an older brother to be honored and looked up to in
<span id="page-??"></span>
475 Christian

every sense of the word, Again we quote from his
brother Albert's recollections:-- 'The four older
children of my parents were boys. The oldest was
Christian (or Chris or C, I.) then Andrew, Joseph
and myself, In the early days, in Mayfield espec-
ially, we often roamed the foothills and fields
together. Chris generally took the responsibility
of my supervision on such occasions. In later
years we four were passed off as 'oldest' and

"youngest' and 'middle two', I generally looked to
Chris as my 'big brother' and a real big brother
he was. . , I remember well when I was struggling

to get an education. Very frequently there was a
shortage of spending money. At one of these
critical times my oldest brother (Chris) came to
my aid, and that without asking, . . While I was
attending Law School at Ann Arbor, Michigan, my
finances were again very limited. I sold some of
the things Thad at Gunnison, including my rubber-
tired buggy and some other articles of which I now
have little memory. Inthe autumn of 1898, when
Iwas about at the point of seeking some help to
tide me over my last year, I received a letter
from my oldest brother, Chris, or C. I. Christen-
sen, as he then signed his name. This letter has
always seemed to me to be somewhat of a miracle,
It read, in substance:-- 'Dear Albert, I have just
sold a herd of sheep and I am wondering if you
won't need some help to see you through school.

If you will let me know about how much you will
need a month I will be glad to send it to you.'

"No one will ever know how grateful I felt
for this message. As a child Chris had always
been my ideal and almost my guardian. Now he
was turning out to be my savior, materially, as
well, Needless to say, I accepted his offer with
heartfelt thanks. Thereafter, the needed checks ©
came regularly, Just before graduation he sent a .
larger check to take care of my graduation and my
trip home. . . Upon returning home I figured I
owed the Manti City Savings Bank a total of $700
and interest, My brother Chris had told me while
Iwas at school that he would look after the interest
on my note, but I wanted to make such further
arrangements as might be necessary. I went to
the bank and requested the cashier to look up the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 476

condition of my account and told him that I would
like to get an extension. He left and in a minute
he came back and said, 'You have no loan here; it
was paid in full by Chris about a year ago.'. .,
When I went back to Gunnison a few days later, I
called in to thank my brother for what he had done
for me and to give him my note. He told me to
forget it. When I told him I couldn't do that, he
finally insisted that he would accept nothing more
than the principal. ‘You can take what time you
want to pay that', he added. I shall be in Chris'
debt forever."

That's the kind of fellow Christian ''I'' Chris-
tensen was, and others of his brothers and sisters
could have told similar stories about his kindness
and helpfulness to them. While a number of these
were struggling to get their college educations at
B. Y. U. inthe early nineties, Chris came to their
aid time and time again. His daughter Pearl says:
"Christian saved enough money to help his three
brothers and one sister through school at Provo.
Ihave been told that at one time he had saved two
hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces and he used what
was needed of it to help with their educations and
also buy new graduation outfits and pay for having
their pictures taken.'' More has been given about
this in an earlier chapter but too much cannot be
said about the generosity and charity of this wonder-
ful brother.

We continue from Pearl's history:-- ''Christian,

a strong Republican leader in Gunnison, was active

in politics there. He was City Recorder at one

time and City Treasurer, and was on the Gunnison
School Board of Education for a period of eight

years, from 1900 to 1908. He always used to see
that everyone had a chance to vote at elections,

and helped by picking up in his buggy those who

might not otherwise have ways to get to the polls,
especially the widows.

"The 4th and 24th of July were great days for
celebration in Gunnison, Christian liked to see
that all the children rode in the parade on a big
flat-topped wagon; he called them 'Utah's Best
Crop'. He loved to see everybody having a good
time. His little girls were dressed in white silk
<span id="page-??"></span>

dresses and his little boys in blue pants and blue
and white striped shirts, which their mother
Caroline made for them. She took pride in sewing
for her children. One year Christian was 'Marshal
of the Day' for one of these big celebrations. He
wore a large black Stetson hat with a long ostrich
plume which hung down over his shoulder and he
rode a black, shiney horse with its mane and tail
braided with blue ribbons. We all called the horse
‘Old Black Joe',

"Christmas was another great holiday for
our family and both father and mother enjoyed
having their children and their relatives and friends
around them to help celebrate. Some of the many
good features were the wonderful dinners mother
cooked and served at those times, as well as on
other special occasions suchas L. D. S. Confer-
ence times when we usually had visitors at our
house, especially after we moved to Salt Lake
City."

In 1908 Chris dissolved his partnership with
Lafe Bown and joined with John M. Cannon of Salt
Lake City, and other smaller stockholders, in
what became known as the ''Bennion Livestock
Company". As has been mentioned earlier, this
company's main headquarters was a large ranch
on the headwaters of the Weber River in north-
eastern Utah, which they called ''The Weber",
together with other smaller ranches and accom-
panying range lands in the areas. Chris trailed
his sheep and other livestock from Twelve Mile
in Sanpete County to The Weber, and his brothers
Albert and Arthur had some of their sheep trailed
up there also, as they became smaller stockholders
in this venture. Arthur's brother-in-law, Bert
Gledhill, writes something of this:-- "Arthur, after
his marriage, was associated with his brother,
Albert Christensen, in the sheep business, They
lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina.
After lambing, about July lst, they would move
into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months
and then winter on the west desert. As I remember,
Arthur and his brother Louis took care of the sheep
on the desert until the later years. Iwas herding
with Louis on Cedar Mt. one summer when we got
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 478

word to take 1500 head of sheep and start for the
Weber River area above Oakley, Utah. Arthur
met us above Gunnison and was in charge from
there. That was the start of the Bennion Livestock
Company in which Arthur, Albert and Chris be-
came interested. The following year the company
bought a ranch at Upton, on Huff Creek, from a
Mr. Benson, and Arthur was made foreman of that
ranch. The company herders came there for
supplies, which were hauled twelve miles by team
from Coalville. I lived with Arthur and Millie for
a time and worked on that ranch."

Chris was up on The Weber in May 1910
when he received word of the serious illness of
two of his young daughters. Pearl tells of their
deaths:-- 'In 1910 scarlet fever hit the town of
Gunnison and nearly all the children got it. Elora
and Orilla took the terrible fever and both died of
it within five days of each other. There wasn't
much help for them in those days. Father did not
get home before Orilla died but he came a few hours
before Elora did. She spoke to him and asked him
not to be 'Woodman', meaning a member of the
Woodman of the World Lodge. This request he
kept. (She also, in her young and innocent way,
asked him to take her mother and the children to
the Manti Temple and have them all sealed to him
as a family, for eternity. This he also promised
and was most sincere in it but, like so many, put
it off for awhile for more pressing things and never
seemed to get around to it.) The funeral services
were held on the front lawn of the home. The
girls' caskets were raised so that everyone could
see how pretty they were, with Elora's golden
brown hair which covered her like a cape to her
knees and Orilla's reddish-golden curls. Their
deaths were such sorrows to our family.

"Later on that summer father sold most of
his interests in Gunnison, including our home
which he sold to his brother Arthur, and bought
his brother Andrew's home on 9th East and 27th
South in Salt Lake City. (This home has been so
well described by Andrew's daughter Edyth in
other chapters of this book.) It was hard on our
family at first to move from the country into a big

city among strangers. But since all the members
were very active in the Church at the time, all
except father, it didn't take long before we had
made many new friends in the Forest Dale Ward
into which we had moved, Mother took part in
Relief Society and other church functions, When-
ever father was at home he always attended meet-
ings with us, though he was never home long
enough to fill a position of responsibility. He
held the priesthood and was always a faithful
supporter of the L. D. S. Church, in spite of the
fact that his business and interests required that
he spend most of his time, especially his winters
and springs, away from the centers of civilization
and his family.

"He had replaced his buckboard with a Ford
pickup truck, which made things easier for him
and traveling faster. He traveled so many times
in the night to be able to keep his appointments.
When he could he took the train to Wyoming and
often stayed overnight at the hotel in Carter, try-
ing to get himself cleaned up a little from the grime
oftravel, or, as he said, 'taking a bath in a tea
cup.' He spent many days and nights in the terrible
cold of Wyoming's winters. The Carter range was
below zero most of the time then,."'

But summers were different as far as being
with his family was concerned. Pearl writes of
this:-- 'For many years, after we moved to Salt
Lake, our family spent most of the summers on
the ranch owned by the Bennion Livestock Company,
called 'The Weber'. We would move there as soon
as school was out in the spring and stay until late
fall, except for a trip or two back to Salt Lake to
check on the family home and get supplies for our-
selves and the hired men, as well as grain for the
horses. One of the highlights of these trips back
and forth, especially for father, was to stop at the
creamery located in the little town of Oakland.
Father was extremely fond of buttermilk and was
always sure of getting all he could drink of that
refreshing beverage whenever he stopped there.
it has been stated that his capacity for buttermilk
was remarkable.

"On the ranch in summers there was always
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 480

plenty of work to be done. Ranch work however
was interesting to us children and father seemed
to enjoy having us help with such things as separat-
ing sheep in the pens and getting lambs ready to
trail to market. When it was sheep shearing time
at the various shearing corrals, we loved to go
along and play on the giant wool sacks. We looked
forward to going with father to the many sheep
camps scattered throughout the area, for this
meant horseback rides through the mountains.

The Company owned a small ranch and lambing
ground in Chalk Creek Basin east of Coalville and
up over the mountain directly north of The Weber,
Trips were made there to get horses, etc., and
trips were taken to the company ranch at Upton,
which was also east of Coalville and where they
raised hay and grain and made butter and had a
place to feed the company's horses.

"But if this was called 'work' there was
plenty of time left for fun too. A short distance
from the two-story-ranch-house was a small lake
called 'Commisary Lake'. Because this lake had
no outlet its waters became quite warm in summer-
time and thus it became a favorite swimming hole
for the entire family. This was fun. It was fun
too for the whole family to spend time picking the
delicious wild raspberries that abounded in the
nearby areas, and make a picnic of it."

Christian purchased a part of the ranch known
as 'The Oasis'' near Lyman, Wyoming, as we have
heard, and about the same time he bought a dry
farm in Cedar Valley, west of Lehi, Utah and a
fruit farm at LaVerkin, Utah, in the Dixie country,
which his brother Andrew had interested him in.

It appeared quite evident that he had great hopes
for the future and that things ahead looked bright
for him indeed.

Pearl telis that her father never liked to use
the word ''goodbye''. It was always just ''see you
later" or ''so long''. As he left his home in Salt
Lake City that last time in late September of 1917,
he didn't say ''see you later'' but simply "so long".
In fact, as he left that last time, he returned from
the front gate to the front door three times to say
"so long" to his beloved wife, Caroline. That was
<span id="page-??"></span>
481 Christian

the last time she saw him until she stood by his
deathbed at The Oasis in Wyoming the first part
of October. The circumstances of Christian's
accident and death have been covered in a previous
chapter but we should like to present his daughter
Pearl's courageous and moving account of those
also:--

''Father was shot the night of Oct. 2nd 1917,
at the ranch, and died there Oct. 5th, He was to
have gone up in another direction, but he did not
go and of course we didn't know this, He had cau-
tioned Roy and me to shoot for help if we saw any-
thing moving in the area. I feel that I was at fault
as much as Roy, although he held the gun, for just
as he fired in the air from the doorway the screen
door Iwas trying to hold open for him flew shut on
the gun, putting the shot onto father. Of course
we didn't know at the time that it was father. All
we knew was that we could see someone moving in
our yard, that we had been told to shoot for help
in such a case, and that we were frightened. I
guess this was just supposed to be - just one of
those things, This has been so terrible for us to
live with. As for me, I can hardly stand to talk
about it even now, after more than fifty years,

We all loved our father so dearly!

"He lived three days after he was shot in the
back, The bullet lodged in his chest and ricocheted
so badly that they dared not move him, except into
the ranch house. He suffered terribly. He talked
to us and forgave us with all his heart and soul,
because he knew we did not mean to do it. We
were just carrying out his orders to shoot for help
if we saw anything moving. They embalmed him
at the ranch and then we took his body on the train
to be further prepared for burial. Then we took
his body on to Gunnison where his funeral and
burial were held, 12 Oct. 1917."

Sensitive people sometimes seem to die a
little themselves with experiences such as these;
but life must go on for them nevertheless, for they
too "have promises to keep and miles to go before
they sleep - and miles to go before they sleep".
Christian's descendants should take comfort in
his nobleness of character and the examples he
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 482

set for them in service to his fellowmen. (Has it
not been said in the scriptures - ''For he that hath
done it unto the least of these, my brethren, hath
done it unto me''.) Truly he was a doer of good as
well as a leader among men. Though he had little
opportunity for formal schooling, yet he was an
educated man with an educated heart - a great and
passionate heart. That one of his main goals was
to give his wife and children the better things of
life and leave them all well fixed, there can be no
doubt. For this he worked and labored hard, sacri-
ficing his own comfort. One cannot do everything
but Christian did much. He was a man of action.

Caroline Larsen (Christensen) wife of
Christian "I'' Christensen, was born in Christen-
burg, Sanpete, Utah 7 Apr. 1871, the daughter of
Ole Hansen Larsen and Inger Olsen (Larsen) early
Utah Pioneers, She was baptized a member of the
L. D. S. Church in the Sanpitch River which ran
near her home, in the early spring following her
eighth birthday. Her father was a farmer anda
freighter in those early Gunnison Valley days.
Caroline and her brothers and sisters helped on
the farm.

Pearl tells of her mother:-- ''Caroline
gleaned wheat with her mother, Inger, and others,
and her little bare feet would get so sore. Her
mother would wash and oil them and wrap them up
in rags. Many a night the small girl cried in pain.
Shoes were very hard to get at those times. Caro-
line had one pair for church and Sunday School,
‘Sunday shoes' they were called. This one pair of
little shoes she treasured very much, She was
about ten years old before she had shoes to wear
all of the time. The Larsen children and others
from Christenburg had a long way to go to church
and Sunday School, Primary, Religion Class and
also school, for they had to go to Gunnison, several
miles away.

"Caroline was a happy natured child and loved
to help her mother. She loved to sit by her side
and sew. When she had a few pennies she would
<span id="page-??"></span>
483 Christian

buy a piece of calico and make quilt blocks, and by
the time she was thirteen years old she had pieced
the tops for three quilts. She was eager to learn
and besides sewing she loved music and painting.
When she grew older she did a number of beautiful
paintings. She was very talented with her hands.
She was a beautiful seamstress and an excellent
cook. She learned to card wool, make rugs, quilt,
make butter and cheese and soap and cure meat,
and all the other early household arts that prepared
her to manage a successful home.

"Caroline and her brothers and sisters and
friends, including the Christensen children next
door, loved to swim in the Sanpitch River back of
their barn in what they called 'The Big Hole’. It
was here that her little sister, Josephine, age
four, was drowned. They found her little body a
mile down stream. The Larsen and Christensen
children, as neighbors, played together at many
things and Caroline Larsen and Christian Chris-
tensen became childhood sweethearts while in
Christenburg.

"When Caroline was about fifteen years old
her father built a lovely home in Gunnison, where
they went to live in winters though they continued
to spend most of their summers on the farm in
North Christenburg. The first winter in their new
home her little brother Peter and sister Hanner
died of diphtheria during an epidemic.

"Caroline grew to be a beautiful young lady.
She was dainty and small of stature with lovely
blond hair and blue eyes, She was also soft
spoken, modest and gentle in nature - and she
was kind, She and Christian continued their
courtship which resulted in their marriage, 28
Dec. 1893, when he was twenty-six and she was
nearing twenty-three. The bride wore a pretty
robin-egg blue satin dress and orange blossoms
in her beautiful long blond hair. She made a
lovely wife and mother. The couple had eight
children, four girls and four boys: Pearl Eva,
Inger Elora, Giles Elmer, Christian LeRoy,
Orilla, Myrtle Ivy, Farrald DeLong, and Gorden
Larsen Christensen.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Christian 484

"When Caroline received word of Christian's
fatal accident she was frantic. Mr. Cope, secre-
tary for the Bennion Livestock Company, took her
to Wyoming to be near him, immediately, in his
car, She left the three younger children, Ivy,
Farrald and little Gorden, at home along, with a
kind neighbor, Mrs. Seegmiller, to look out for
them if things went wrong. Pearl and Roy were of
course at the ranch and Elmer was on the farm in
Cedar Valley but soon joined the others. Caroline
was at Christian's bedside to bid him 'so long' when
the end came for him. His brother Louis and sister
Elsie and her two girls, and Bishop Clarence Rollins
of Lyman, Wyoming were on the train with Caroline,
Pearl and Roy when they brought the body to Salt
Lake City. Mr. Cope met them at the station and
did everything he could to help out. The body was
taken to the old Taylor Mortuary, then on West
Temple and First South. The others went on to
Gunnison where they were joined by their families,
as well as relatives and friends from both Wyoming
and Utah. But Caroline and her children stayed
several days in Salt Lake making preparations and
then all went down with the body, to join the others
for Christian's funeral and burial,"

About two months later, 5 Dec. 1917, Caro-
line took her children to the Salt Lake Temple and
had the necessary endowments and the sealing of
the family for eternity taken care of - all but Pearl,
who was then beyond the proper age. They were
accompanied by Christian's parents, Laurs and
Else K. Christensen. (Pearl had her own endow-
ments and was sealed to her parents some forty-
one years after, 26 June 1959, also in the Salt
Lake Temple.) Caroline herself went to the temple
often after that wonderful experience there that
December 1917, and continued to do so up until
three weeks before her death. She loved the
church and was a faithful attender to her duties as
amember. She had a strong testimony of the
divinity of the Gospel and her faith never wavered
throughout all the trials and tribulations of her
widowhood,

Caroline and Christian had been married
almost twenty-four years when he died, Just over

twelve years later her youngest son passed away,
lacking three months of his eighteenth birthday,

9 Jan. 1930, Christian had been well insured and
owned much property, which was soon sold. His
part of The Oasis, where he died, was purchased
by his brother Louis. The family would have been
left in fairly good circumstances had not the tender
hearted Caroline made some rather substantial
loans for which, through unforeseen circumstances,
she was never reimbursed, She herself died 8
June 1941, two months and one day following her
seventieth birthday, having outlived Christian

over twenty-three and a half years, during which
time she continued to live in her own home in Salt
Lake City. Following is part of an article which
was published in the Deseret News at the time of
her death.

(2) ANDREW "'B'' CHRISTENSEN

Andrew, second child of Laurs M. C. and-
Elise K. Christensen, was born Sunday 6 June 1869
in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. Black Hawk Indian War
hostilities were nearly over then and the railroad
had just come to Utah Territory, the last spike
having been driven at Promontory Point 10 May 1869,
<span id="page-??"></span>

linking the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Rail-
roads ina great transcontinental system. Andrew
was named for his mother's father, the Danish
version of the name being ''Anders'., When he was
a young man he added the middle initial 'B" and
changed the last three letters of his surname from
the original Danish spelling, ''sen'' to ''son"'. He
was less than a year old when his family moved
into Gunnison Valley and here he spent most of the
remainder of his childhood, in such communities
as Gunnison, Mayfield and Christenburg. He was
baptized a member of the L. D. S. church in May-
field and it was here he also started school, We
feel fortunate to have had choice contributions
about him from each of his six children now living.
Most of the remainder of Andrew's story comes
from them.

Wendell begins:-- ''Father came from sturdy
Danish stock - men and women of courage, faith
and vision. At age thirteen he left home to work
and help out. His first job was as a herder for the
well-to-do but rather godless man, Julius Christen-
sen, who spent time telling Andrew that a belief in
God was utter foolishness. One day this man, while
riding the range accompanied by father, was caught
in a heavy cloudburst. In trying to cross a gulley,
swollen with flood waters, the bankcaved in plung-
ing horse and rider into the torrent. The man
caught a hanging branch and was helped out by
father, who said he never heard a man pray to God
more fervently for deliverance."

Edythe tells a similar story about this pro-
fessional atheist, Julius Christensen, and young
Andrew:-- ''Father believed with heart and soul in
the divinity of the Restored Gospel of Christ.
Whether in jest or soberness, the older man made
a point of now and then testing Andrew's faith. It
nettled the younger man, One day it became nec-
essary to cross a small lake, As often happens
with almost no warning, a sudden squall developed.
The wind blew hard and the waves rose high. The
rowboat, near the center of the lake, jerked and
tossed about until it seemed it would surely capsize.
Andrew, who was rowing and fighting the elements
with all his might, began praying fervently. To
<span id="page-??"></span>
487 Andrew

his utter amazement, Julius dropped to his knees
in the bottom of the boat and, calling upon Diety,
also pleaded to be saved."

Wendell continues:-- ''Much of father's time
for the next six years was spent alone in the moun-
tains and deserts far from home and loved ones.
His companions were mostly sheep, wild animals
and rough men, He had many hair-raising exper-
iences of which he told us years and years later,
before the fire on long evenings. He was a mar-
velous story teller and we children would sit
entranced, reliving such experiences with him,

One of my favorites was about the day he had
climbed to a high ledge on a slope ove rlooking the
sheep herd and was deep in study when his atten-
tion was drawn to a disturbance in the flock.
Looking down he saw a huge grizzly bear coming

up the slope toward him. Although bears were

not uncommon in the Henry Mountains, father was
unarmed and this one seemed to have but one object
in mind - him! First young Andrew shouted, then
threw stones, but the grizzly came steadily onward,
In desperation he looked around for some means of
defense when he noticed a deep crack in the ledge
upon which he stood. Bracing himself against the
mountainside, he placed his heels in the crack and
pushed and strained with all his might. Slowly the
crack began to widen and, just as the bear reached
the bottom of the ledge, a great section broke loose,
crashing with a thud in front of the beast, followed
by a shower of rocks and dirt. The bear rose on
his haunches, then turned and headed straight down
the mountain with a large boulder close behind and
gaining Speed at every turn. Father said he never
Saw a bear run so fast! The last glimpse he had

of the brute was as it headed into the scrub oak and
quaking aspen, with the huge rock speeding unchecked
behind, crashing trees and brush in its path. The
Sight hit father's 'funny-bone' and he literally rolled
on the ground and laughed.

"Through all his lonely days and nights he
never ceased to remain true to the teachings of
his parents and his church. Truly he lived close
to the Lord during those years and had some
remarkable spiritual experiences which comforted
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 488

him in his loneliness and strengthened him in his
faith and convictions as to the part he personally
might play in shaping the world about him. All
boys have dreams, but Andrew's were a bit vast.
But to him they were real and he seemed to see
before him all the means for their realization,
During those years he never ceased to study and
prepare for the future that began to take shape in
his young, active mind. He dreamed of getting an
education and kept books in a box in the sheep wagon.
These he studied frequently, preparing for the day
when he could go back to school and then begin his
accomplishments."

Luther writes:-- ''There is nothing under
heaven quite like herding sheep to make an intelli-
gent young man realize there are better things in
life. It was sometime during those half dozen years
of playing nursemaid to the wooly creatures that
there developed in father a longing for a more formal
education. Those long hours, while the sheep bedded
down at midday and at nights, gave ample time for
him to daydream and formulate his plans, and from
the classrooms of nature he learned well. It was
from this period of his life that he drew much of
the material for the wonderful and sometimes hair-
raising experiences that he later told us children;
the true stories that kept us quiet on long, slow,
dusty wagon or car rides, rated with refreshments
at our home evenings, or produced lucious drowsi-
ness at bedtime."

Again we quote from Wendell's narrative:--
"At age nineteen father had acquired some sheep
of his own and he decided to put one of his brothers
in charge of them and start school. He went back
to Gunnison and finished the grades, embarrassed
by his size and age. Seminary followed, where he
got high grades. He became a fine scholar, He
went on to the Brigham Young Academy at Provo,
the fall of 1891, and here he spent most of the next
four winters. He taught part time the one of 1893-
94 and graduated from the Academy 23 May 1895,
with the degree of Bachelor of Pedegogy.

It was while at B. Y. A. the winter of
1891/92 that father became better acquainted with
Sarah Jane Bartholomew and her older sister Roxie.
<span id="page-??"></span>
489 Andrew

He fell in love with Sarah. The year following his
graduation they were married. This took place

1 July 1896 inthe Manti Temple. (Andrew had
been given a mission call to the southern states
earlier that year, but this was changed in order
that he might accept a call to develop the school
at Kanab, Utah.) In July or August following their
marriage, the honeymoon trip was made ina
wagon containing all of their belongings as they
made their way southeast, where father was to
serve as Principal of the Kanab District School,"!

Andrew and Sarah boarded and roomed at the
home of a son of Jacob Hamblin, Walter Hamblin
and his wife Blanch Robinson Hamblin, who had
been married only about two years themselves.
The house in which they lived is still standing and
today is owned by some descendants of the Hamblins.
A ninety-one year old lady still living in Kanab
(1968) Mrs, Blanch Hicks Mace, once lived in the
house across the road from the Hamblin place.

She remembers going there many years ago and
seeing a beautiful handmade picture of some yarn
flowers hanging on the wall. She was told that
Mrs, A. B. Christensen made the picture for
Blanch Hamblin, when they lived there together
in the Gay Nineties. Mrs. Mace also remembers
her husband, Charles Mace, speaking of Principal
A. B. Christensen, who signed Charlie's certifi-
cate of promotion from the 7th grade of the Kanab
District School, 1 Apr. 1898. This certificate is
still intact.

Andrew's children have divided their accounts
of him into three parts - Dreams Dreamed -
Dreams Realized - Dreams Unfulfilled. Edythe
writes;-- "Being the eldest child to live, I shall
write mostly of the second part, for from these
years 1 can report first hand. Father did not do
things by halves. A degree from B, Y. U. was
not enough, After two winters of teaching in
Kanab he took mother and their firstborn, Adelbert,
to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he entered the
School of Literature at the University there. This
is when I made my appearance,!!

Andrew remained in Ann Arbor for nearly
three years and won his diploma, being graduated
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 490

with high honors in the class of 1901. Returning
with his family to Utah, he received a call to head
the Church Academy at St. George. This was the
forerunner of Dixie College. He remained in the
school at St. George for two or three years and
then located his family in Provo. Sometime
following the birth of their third child, Wendell,
most likely the spring of 1904, Andrew left for
some advanced study in Germany. While in
Europe he visited his father's and mother's rela-
tives in Denmark. His studies in Germany, how-
ever, were interrupted prematurely by the death,
in Provo, of his eldest son, Adelbert, December
1904, Andrew withdrew from school and hurried
back home to comfort his wife and family.

Edythe continues: 'Andrew's advanced study
paid off. He was given the principalship, plus a
teaching post, at the Latter-day High School in Salt
Lake City. Dreams were being realized. He signed
on some excellent teachers, He was a tremendous
organizer and his schools ran smoothly, He was
also a forceful, gifted speaker and made many talks
in the Wards and Stakes throughout the valley in the
interest of increased enrollment, He radiated a
magnetic presence, a retentive memory, imagina-
tion, drive and purpose.

"Tt was when we first lived in Salt Lake that
brother Sheldon was born, and three years later
my first sister, Elsie Eliza, Father purchased a
home on a large corner lot at the juncture of 27th
South 9th East. The home was nice to look at, built
of red brick in a compact, artistic form. Sections
of the front window were of stained glass, forming
abay. The rooms were lovely with their richly
embossed wallpaper of wine-red, gold and blue.
There was an upper floor with bedrooms; but best
of all, a long combination storage and playroom,
Here stood the trunk that contained many of mother's
once-used dresses, including her white organdy
wedding gown plus the dainty, French kid slippers
with seed-pearl-studded bows, French heels and
pointed toes.

"These were fruitful, happy times. There
was always so much to do or investigate or con-
struct. There were the annual trips to our
<span id="page-??"></span>
491 Andrew

delightful relatives in Sanpete County; jaunts to

the sheep camps; and in cooler weather, our mem-
orable 'family evenings' where mother played the
hymns and sang alto and father told the most
wonderful stories that always called for ‘just one
more', Father could recite poetry too and often
did; we were held bound under his magnetic spell.
Then there were our Christmases, which were
something to remember, especially the one when
we children found coal in the toes of our stockings.

"We had been duly warned but were a little
unbelieving. Our downcast faces burst into joy
when we were led by our mischievous, doting
parents to investigate the other rooms. In the
front one a fire sputtered from the grate and a
Christmas tree sparkled, alight with tinsel and
candles, (It had been fashioned overnight from
the lower boughs of our own evergreens.) And
oh what gifts there were. Mother had dresseda
doll with real hair for me and father hadn't for-
gotten the books and other exciting things to delight
us all, Little did we know that one of our very next
Christmases would be spent in Germany at the
home of one of father's professors, a Herr Doctor,
whose name Ihave forgotten, and that the gifts
would be beyond any we had ever seen, like some-
thing from a fairy tale, for Germany was then the
toy center of the world,

"On our lot in Salt Lake City were a garden,
orchard, berries, a natural spring gushing forth
clear, cool water, and our own fishpond which
father had built, But our baby sister was far too
fond of water and her later drowning, the early
spring of 1910, in this pond, brought a sobering
period into all our lives, coupled with a haunting
remorse that lay just below the surface for many
years to come. (More detail has been given
earlier of little Elsie's death.) Father became
restless - did he blame himself?

"By July of the same year, father, mother,
my two brothers and I were enroute to Europe,
where father planned to study again. We had sold
our home in Salt Lake to generous Uncle Chris to
help finance the same. Father continued to take
an interest in explaining, showing, guiding and
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 492

inspiring our eager lives. Mother also threw off
her sadness as best she could and seemed to enjoy
this period of her life.

"Father at first did some research at Christ
College in Oxford, England. But for part of each
day members of his family were also educated when,
under his expert guidance, we wandered through the
various colleges with their lovely green, deer-
infested parks; the many musty, vine covered old
churches; walked along the tree-shaded banks of
the winding river and even rowed boats on the same
quiet stream. Sometimes we watched the rowing
teams or opposing teams of young men engaged in
playing rugby or cricket. We browsed through
secondhand book stores and rode on street cars
drawn by horses along crooked streets that had
originally served as cow trails.

"We left England and met Grandfather and
Grandmother Christensen in the Province of
Thisted, Denmark. Then followed a few weeks of
nothing but visiting our Danish relatives. In the
main they were prosperous appearing farmers with
fine, snug barns boasting fat, sleek animals and
many ducks and geese. The hand of welcome was
extended until 'Mormonism' was mentioned. Grand-
mother Christensen's visit had been in the interest
of genealogy. She loved people and was in her true
element. Father assisted her in this work, It was
his second trip to Denmark and the relatives there.
At the Danish capitol of Copenhagen, he made time
to take us to the Thorvaldsen Museum and Chapel
that houses the moving sculptures of Christ and
His Twelve Apostles, Father related the story of
the artist Thorvaldsen's humble beginning when as
a poor boy, along the wharf, he was discovered
whittling remarkable little figures of wood. Some-
one of note spotted the boy's potential and started
him on his way towards becoming Denmark's
greatest sculptor,

"From Denmark we went to Germany where
father studied next, We were taken by him to see
children's plays staged with unbelievable imagina-
tion and delight. ‘Hansel and Gretel' and many of
the fairy tales were made real before our very
eyes, We visited the 'Gowandhaus', world famous

concert hell established by Felix Mendelssohn, and
took a journey to the site of the huge, almost ugly
mausoleum of stone commemorating the Napoleanic
War victims who lost their lives in that vicinity.

Sometime in late spring, following my third
brother Luther's birthday in May 1911, father
received an invitation from one of the professors
ofthe Sorbonne in Paris. For five weeks, five
men were to live at his home and there study,
discuss and absorb whatever phase of research
he chose. This was a wonderful opportunity for
father. The family headed for Paris, all except
Wendell and I who were left at school in Germany.

"Returning from Europe the early fall of
1911, father was given a full professorship at
Brigham Young University. It was about the end
of our stay at Provo that my second sister, Lucile,
was born (1914) for after three years of teaching
at B. Y. U. father was called to head the Church
Academy at Rexburg, Idaho, Here he was instru-
mental in establishing Ricks as a college. During
his sojourn there, from 1914 to 1917, improvements
were made, anew gymnasium built and the student
enrollment climbed to new totals,"!

Wendell again takes up the story:-- ''During
the last year in Rexburg father rented a wheat farm
twenty miles east of the city, The crops were ©
already planted and all our family had to do was
keep it free from mustard weed and marauding
cattle. It was a marvelous summer vacation,

When harvest time came we called in the 'com-
bines' which cut and threshed for a share in the
profits, After all expenses, father realized $3, 000,
almost as much as an entire year's teaching salary.
He began to feel restless again. He had not for-
gotten those boyhood dreams and was becoming
impatient with the low salaries and limited oppor-
tunities within the confines of the schools,

"His daughter Edythe had become a bit thin
and anemic but there was nothing so serious that
a summer in the sunshine wouldn't cure. Father
seized upon this as an excuse to leave Ricks and
the schoolroom, and in the spring of 1917 moved
the family (much to mother's disappointment) to
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 494

the warm, dry climate of Utah's Dixie. He settled
us in the very small community of LaVerkin, within
walking distance of his option-to-title-acquired
mineral hot springs on the bank of the Virgin River
where, with the help of Sheldon, myself and an occa-
sional hired man with team and scraper, father
began to build a bath house near the LaVerkin Hot
Springs, The development of these springs had
long been in his plans. He visualized a health spa,
with tourist cabins on the hillside and hot mineral
baths piped to every cabin. The water there seemed
to have unusual properties and people came from
near and far to enjoy it. Along with the hot springs,
father had made filings on the waters of the Virgin
River and had plans for building a dam near the
entrance to Zions Canyon, which would provide
irrigation for thousands of acres of desert land in

a climate nearly equal to that of California. It was
a good plan and money for the initial work was
acquired from the local people and everything was
ready to start. The U. S. Government was ready
to put up about six million dollars. Unfortunately
war was declared between the United States and
Germany about that time and all government
reclamation commitments were withdrawn.

"This was a severe setback for father. He
had come so close to real wealth, possibly
millions, from the sale of land under this project.
Instead he was left in debt and years of hard work
and planning had been lost. But soon he was again
called into the service of the church school system.
This time it was to go to Hinckley, Millard Co.,
Utah to head up the church school there. This was
in the summer of 1918. Father and the rest of the
family went ahead to Hinckley to find a place to
live, leaving Sheldon and I, fifteen and thirteen
years old respectively, to bring a load of our
belongings from LaVerkin. The roads were not
as they are today and it was a hard trip through
sandstorms, snowstorms and mud. As we neared
our destination the country appeared barren and
desolate. We passed a covered wagon headed back
towards Fillmore. Across the canvas cover was
printed a large sign - 'In God we trusted and in
Delta we rusted', (Delta was a town near Hinckley. )
<span id="page-??"></span>
495 Andrew

"Father found a house and farm near the edge
of town and here we settled. He was soon busy
with school and business trips, leaving Sheldon
and I, under mother's direction, to run the farm.
We worked hard but with poor results. Little
would grow, This experience ended any real
interest in farming either of us would ever have,
This place held little challenge and interest for
father as well, for though he went through the
motions faithfully, his soul did not respond. One
good thing to come out of Hinckley, however, was
our baby sister Margaret, born there the last of
May that year 1919. About the same time father
resigned the posts of school teacher, principal and
president of schools for the rest of his life."

Lucile's clear-cut memories of events began
about this time. She says: 'As a child I had a
fearless passion for horses, While we still lived
in Hinckley we owned a cantankerous team named
Fox and Dobin. Often as they stood feeding in the
barn I would crawl under them up into the manger
and manage to mount one, via its neck. When the
team was hitched for plowing I was usually there
and one time, misjudging my timing, I slipped
from the front seat of the disk-plow and fell behind
the horses, gashing my lip to make a scar I still
carry.

"Soon after this experience we moved to Star
Ranch, between Mona and Santaquin. After we
were settled there father, understanding my
unsatiable longing for a horse, gave me a little
sure-footed mare which I promptly named 'Queen'.
For the full summer I remember no other com-
panion than the beautiful animal on whose back I
lived and dreamed."

Wendell picks up the story:-- ''Being finished
with school by the spring of 1919, father turned
his whole attention to his projects. With a younger
brother, Judge Albert Christensen, and a brother-
in-law of mother's, Otis Ercanbrack, he acquired
the Star Ranch about eighteen miles north of Nephi,
Utah. It was a beautiful place near the foot of
lofty mountains from which flowed both surface
and underground streams, Much of the land was
watered by deep artesian wells. To the west was
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 496

a lake stocked with fish, and in the fail with an
abundance of ducks and wild geese. On this pro-
perty stood three large brick houses, The one to
the north in which we lived was beautifully furnished
and gave our family many happy hours.

"When we moved to Star Ranch, Edythe had
been ready for college and Sheldon and I for High
School. Arrangements were made to move the
family to Provo in winters between 1919 to 1922,
for short school terms, but the remainder of the
time we worked on the ranch. In the fall of 1921
Edythe left for study in Boston. By working part
time and through frugal living, a scholarship, a
loan from an available church school fund, the help
of an occasional relative or friend and the Lord,
she made it through two consecutive years of study.
Father could only give encouragement and mother
did her part by sending a dress now and then that
she had sewn or remodled beautifully.

"The Star Ranch venture seemed to hold
great promise and for a time prosperity seemed
assured, Crops were planted - wheat, alfalfa and
sugar beets. There were also horses, cattle,
chickens and pigs on the place, which was well
equipped with barns and corrals, With the addition
of some machinery, including a tractor, we were
in business, We children all worked very hard and
were proud and happy and filled with hope for the
future, There was talk among us of college,
missions, travel and great accomplishments, On
the other hand, father seemed impatient for success,
He was offered an additional opportunity to buy a
cattle ranch of about 5,000 acres near Duchesne,
in eastern Utah. The bank was willing to put up
the money and, with a thousand head of cattle
thrown into the bargain, this looked very attractive -
so he made the deal. A quick calculation on father's
part placed our total wealth then at almost $500, 000,
which, with luck and a few good years, would pay
off all the debts and plenty to go.

"The winter of 1922 started our normal
enough. Crops had been good. Cattle were fat
and ready for the market with an offered price of
$60. 00 a head - $60, 000 for the herd. Wheat was
bid at $2.00 a bushel and we had 10, 000 bushels to
<span id="page-??"></span>
497 Andrew

sell, Word went around among the farmers, how-
ever, that prices would be higher in the spring and
to hold their crops. Spring never really came.
The snow was heavy and stayed on the ground until
nearly May. Food for cattle became scarce and
father was forced to buy hay at $40. 00 a ton to
keep 1,000 head of cattle from starving. Again
the banks advanced the money. Finally, when
winter ended, the market had vanished for both
cattle and wheat. It was almost impossible to

sell at any price. The banks which had loaned so
freely now wanted their money. Farmers, who
for all their lives had been able to get almost any
amount on signature, were given a flat 'no!'
Father of course was over-extended. It cost him
his share of the ranches and all other owned assets
to get out, and he still owed thousands of dollars.

'In 1923 we left Star Ranch and moved to
Salt Lake City. I suppose we had lived in worse
places but the little house on the bend of the Jordan
River was at least a place to house the family now
in dire financial straits. Mother, brave and cheer-
ful, set about, with almost no money, to make the
place livable, scrubbing, cleaning, painting and
papering, with the help of us children. I remember
my pride in helping to select the paper which,
when hung, looked great.

"I don't know just how father managed; I'm
sure he was deeply discouraged and for a time
there was little for him to do but borrow from
friends and relatives. He was gone a great deal
trying to get things going. For atime he got a
job of some kind in the southern part of the state
somewhere, sending mother the money to meet
accumulated bills, Edythe was asked to come
home from school in the east, which she did,
finding an immediate job to help out. Sheldon
and I worked in some mines in Farmington Canyon
for the same purpose.

"Gradually our situation improved, Father,
by some means, rented a big house on South Main
Street into which we moved,'' Lucile tells of this:--
"We lived in a large red brick house on Main Street
next to the McKinley School, Here were both parlor
and livingroom, and in the latter a fireplace.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 498

Before this fireplace stood father's great big
leather rocker, I remember one winter night he
built a blazing fire, cuddled Margaret on his one
side and me on the other as he sat and let us
choose the stories he would tell. As he gently
rocked he took us into the sheep camps to watch
him outwit a prowling bobcat; he led us up the path
to a castle on the Rhine and he walked with us
through Tom Tower at Oxford. Finally, as the
fire burned to embers and we fell into our dreams,
he carried us one by one and tucked us into bed.
Though the time he spent with us younger children
was limited, it had a rich and satisfying flavor.
We never felt neglect or indifference from him,"

Margaret writes;-- ''As I look back on early
childhood, most of my memories center around our
home at 1879 South Main Street, It was a large
two-story, red brick home with plenty of room for
a big family. There was a large yard, many
beautiful trees, places for secret hide-outs, and
plenty of room to play hide-and-seek and run-
sheep-run. There was a large garden area where
each of us took our turns weeding and helping with
irrigation, There was also a running well where
one could get the coldest drink on a hot summer
day in all Salt Lake. Mother usually kept a few
chickens to help supply her family with fresh eggs
and also to help with an extra treat for some of
those delicious Sunday dinners,

"IT remember my father was a lover of good
books. We had a fine library at home and were
encouraged to use it. How I loved to curl up ona
rainy afternoon and lose myself in a good book,
This was another heritage father passed onto us -
the joy of reading. Religion played a most
important role in our family life also. In fact, it
seemed that our lives literally revolved around
the church. And even though father was not home
a great deal, we knew that we were to attend our
meetings and do our duty there above all else.

I heard him talk in Sacrament meetings many
times and there was no doubt in my mind but that
he had a strong and lasting testimony of the Gospel.
Mother shared this strong testimony.

"Fundamentally, Papa was a sincere family

man, He loved us children but always expected us
to be well mannered and respectful. He could be
stern when he had to but he could be jolly and fun
to be with too. When he was ina teasing mood his
beautiful blue eyes would twinkle. As I remember,
he never spanked me, His most severe punishment
was sternly sending me to my room to contemplate
my shortcomings. I'm afraid Mom was delegated
to correct me for more serious offenses and this
was usually done when Papa was away. I always
felt envious of my older brothers and sister who
had been to Europe with our parents and had such
tremendous experiences, Ithink father realized
this and had every intention of making this up to
the younger members of the family, for he would
many times share his dreams with us as to what
was in store for us as soon as 'the big deal' went
through,

"My papa was one of the grandest persons I
have ever known, During the few short years that
Iwas privileged to know him, he furnished me with
some of my most vivid and cherished memories,
as well as some of the most valued lessons of my
childhood, To me he was always a kind and loving
father, coming home from his various business
trips with tales of the almost-to-be-realized for-
tune, which was his great dream during the later
years of his life, Educated and intelligent as he
was, it was very hard for mother to rationalize
his philosophy concerning his great desire to
become a man of wealth through the complicated
fields of investment and real estate. This desire
became almost an obsession with him.

"Father could well have been the originator
of the saying 'Early to bed and early to rise, etc.'
This was the way he lived and believed firmly that
everyone else should follow suit. We were never
allowed the privilege of 'sleeping in' when he was
home. Five o'clock usually found us up and doing
and, though we may have felt we were being treated
a little unfairly, we all seemed to learn not to
waste time, to take advantage of the beauty of
nature, and that working and accomplishing things
brings joy.'' Luther adds to this evaluation of
their father:-- ''He was generally up at daylight
<span id="page-??"></span>

and wanted everyone else up, The nearest I ever
came to a 'licking' resulted in my going back to
sleep after I had been called to get up. The covers
came off and father had me by the ear and into my
clothes so fast the incident remains in my memory
as ablur. He seemed to have the notion that cows
gave sour milk after five in the morning, He
seemed always ina hurry. He could hardly wait
for the frost to go out of the ground to put ina
garden, then wanted peas and potatoes before the
potatoes had grown much larger than the peas,

"For reasons I don't recall, I didn't start
school until Iwas seven and father seemed deter-
mined I should make up for that lost time. There
were endless sessions sitting beside Dad, a first
grade reader in my lap and tears streaming down
my face, with half a mind on the reading and the
other half exploring the haunted castles across
the alley back of the house. Times tables were
another grim chore,

"IT remember father as not a large man, but
one who looked big at the head of the table and who
seemed to stand out ina crowd. I remember him
as a strict disciplinarian, yet I cannot recall many
stern reprimands or punishments. I was kept
somewhat in line by mother's words, 'Your father
will hear of this when he gets home'. The longer
he was gone the longer the list of 'hear abouts' be-
came and the more I dreaded his return, The
"hear abouts' were resolved listening to lectures
on hard work, dependability, truth and honesty,
and other virtues that seemed appropriate.

"Tt is with reluctance and mixed feelings that
I put into words the pictures of father that were
etched into my memory and had an influence on
my life. It was during the last few years of his
teaching career that my recollections of him began.
He became restless and appeared to be in a hurry
to get places. He seemed dissatisfied with things
as they were and began to spend more time travel-
ing in search of undeveloped, artistic and inventive
talent, land, water, minerals and products,"

Wendell writes: ''The time when we were
living in the big house on South Main Street in Salt

Lake City played a significant part in the shaping
of our lives, We were in the Farmers Ward and
we soon became active in church there and made
many close friends. It was while located here
that Sheldon and I were called on our missions to
Germany; here that our younger, nature-loving
brother Luther, then fourteen, ran away from
home and was gone nearly two years; here that
Edythe was courted and won by Dr. Burtis F.,
Robbins; and here that Lucile and Margaret met
their future husbands and that Sheldon and I met
and later married our wives.

"When I returned from my mission father
was deeply involved in plans to revive the Dixie
Irrigation Project and to develop some little known
resources in Southern California, His fertile
brain had conceived new possibilities in metals
and alloys so advanced that large corporations,
such as the Ford Motor Co., became interested
and promised large sums of money to develop one
possibility - only to find on closer examination
that this brilliant idea had little substance. During
this time I spent all my time with father. I took
no other job and dropped plans to continue school,
I drove the car on his trips, worked on his projects
and met his business partners, until I finally
realized that he was being used by unscrupulous
men, whose sole object was to keep him sold on
their non-existent skills to the end that he raise
more money to feed and maintain them in the per-
petuation of ahoax, The cost ran into thousands,
Being the oldest living son, Iwas rather involved
in our financial and business affairs and was often
given responsibilities which I was not equipped to
bear. Inthe process, I grew and developed but
father had real need for someone with wisdom and
practical business experience to balance his vision
and enthusiasm. Iwas not up to the job, and among
others with whom he counseled there were few who
had either time or experience to really help."

Luther goes on:-- ''Father spent considerable
time, effort and money helping artists such as
Fairbanks, Campbell and Ramsey; guiding them
into scenic areas he knew so well and purchasing
some of the pictures realized from those trips.
<span id="page-??"></span>

He became interested in one of the earliest radios;
a safety tire design that now, forty years later, is
coming into use, and in a metal railroad tie that
may yet be used, Of course the Star Ranch and
Uinta property, which he had visualized as the
beginning of a great cattle empire, came to naught,
He had seen in the fertile but dry land below the
Virgin River and Deep Creek a great irrigation
project if the water from those streams could be
harnessed and utilized, The LaVerkin hot springs,
which later my wife saw as much too hot at one end,
much too cold at the other, and all of them much
too smelly, father had seen as a great medical
center where specialists of the world could apply
their skills, He tried to develop the clay beds back
of Redmond, Utah in order to utilize the medical
properties of that clay. He recognized the potential
value of the rare metal deposits along the Sierra
Nevada Range, which now are being mined for tung-
sten and other elements so vital in the production
of alloys for the aircraft and space industries.

"These projects required large amounts of
capital and into them went every cent he had or
could raise. It was during the height of this quest
for finances that I had the privilege of driving him.
He was pushing himself to the limit of his strength
and ability. In order to conserve his energy and
save hotel bills, we traveled at night while he slept.
It was amazing how he could sleep most of the night
sitting up in a car, spend fifteen minutes shaving
and freshening up in a service station wash room,
then come out looking as fresh and well groomed
as a New York banker, On longer trips, suchas
those between Sali Lake and California, there was
time for sleep and also for long talks, He was
never critical of the past, never tried to place
blame for his disappointments, He was always
enthusiastic toward the future, always planning
new projects or enlarging present ones, He was
the master of words, He used them to build
empires or castles or fortunes and as you listened
you became involved and wanted to help. It was
like a trip to Utopia and what you saw was a better
world and a glorious hereafter, There was a world
in which as yet untapped resources were used for
the betterment of man; oil was extracted from vast
<span id="page-??"></span>
503 Andrew

shale beds; courses of rivers were changed to
make the deserts bloom, and the minds of all men
were turned toward good, There was a powerful
church in which his belief never faltered; strong
family ties and a love for literature and music. It
was to help reach this Utopia that so many paid the
fare, for his words created a vision of smooth
roads, pleasant company and ample rewards at
the end of the journey, It was as a guide for this
trip that he lived and for which he expended his
energy. It has been said that his ideas were twenty
years ahead of the times; that the world was not
then ready for them. Who knows what might have
happened had he gone more slowly, been more
cautious, planned more carefully, built more
solidly and dreamed less - who knows?!"!

"Father always tried,'' says Wendell, ''but
he was human and so made mistakes and sometimes
those mistakes loomed large. He was no ordinary
man; in fact he was far in advance of his times.
Many, having been touched by the magic of his
vision, were made far better and lifted up by that
experience, There were countless ways in which
he showed his love and concern, countless lessons
which he taught with insight and right timing, for
no one can deny but that he was a great teacher -
countless ones have attested to that. In his last
years he drove himself without mercy, though he
was sick and the doctors begged him to stop. In
his travels he was often hungry, living in cheap
rooms and having to borrow money to get home to
mother, From her he would only borrow more to
further other fruitless trips and divide his few
dollars among hangers-on who bled him for all he
could raise. As I look back I think father felt left
out and somewhat deserted those last years. His
family, for whom he had worked and planned so
much, had begun to go its separate ways and each
member was becoming independent. Even mother,
with rare business insight and tireless effort, had
created a profitable sewing business and was no
longer dependent on him, It was a hard role for
father to play and without a doubt, in my opinion,
helped to hasten his death, "'

Margaret says, ''During the last years of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 504

father's life he was afflicted with diabetes. Having
been ill hardly a day up to this time, it was difficult,
if not impossible, for him to accept the fact that he
really had this disease and that if it were not pro-
perly controlled by diet and insulin it could cost his
life. Mother was so careful in planning his meals,
even to weighing everything he ate while he was at
home. She baked special bread, bottled fruit with-
out sugar and planned proper, appetizing meals to
send with him when he traveled. But to no avail,

for as soon as he left home he would eat at restau-
rants, paying no attention to her instructions for

his diet, and would often return home almost in
diabetic coma, Several times this necessitated

his having to be taken to the hospital to be treated
until his blood sugar was again at a safe level, He
would never be convinced that each of these episodes
was weakening his resistance to other infections

and having a dangerous effect on his health.

"During one of his frequent trips to Southern
California he contracted a severe chest cold that
developed into pneumonia. He tried once again to
make it home where he knew he would get loving
care, but became so ill he had to be taken off the
bus at St. George. On the morning of Dec. 17,
1931, mother received the shattering news that
father had passed away. With his death came the
end of my childhood, "'

Sheldon concludes the narrative:-- "Although
father liked fine things, in traveling he was more
apt to choose a modest hotel room with single-bulb,
drop light switch, where perhaps the only item
furnished to brighten the accomodation was a small
cake of lavendar soap of artificial lilac bouquet.
Nor, with his affliction of diabetes, was his pre-
scribed diet adhered to. Again there was a marked
tendency to deny himself in his valiant effort at
reaching for the stars, Through it all, however,
Ido not recall seeing him when his clothes were
not pressed, when he was not clean shaven or when
his shoes were not shined. Except when he traveled,
he was by habit akin to our feathered friends, in
that he always retired and rose with the chickens,
In this respect he utterly shattered Ben Franklin's
statement, 'Early to bed, early to rise, makes a
<span id="page-??"></span>
505 Andrew
man healthy, wealthy and wise !'

"Father died alone in a modest hotel room in
St. George, Oddly enough, 'twas in the same locale
where years prior he pioneered, organized and
established the school that became a very success-
ful church college, endearing himself to the rugged
and good people of that community. Traveling in
severe cold of that December, 1931, I arrived at
St, George about fifteen hours after father's pass-
ing. In the last moments of his life, despite com-
plications of pneumonia and diabetes, still he
bothered to wind his inexpensive time piece, I
remember well, I cried as I held the watch, know-
ing that so long as it ticked, a last bit of father's
tremendous energy still remained. Whether he
really died of a broken heart or was mercifully
taken in illness, Ido not know. But of one thing I
am certain, there still remained an unsubdued
determination and dignity about him to the end.
He was buried in the City Cemetery at Provo,
Utah 20 Dec. 1931.

"To do biographical justice to the life of our
father, Andrew ''B'' Christensen, would involve
an enormous amount of time. We have written
less than a hundredth part, I feel keenly that the
story of his life must be recorded realistically,
as well as in his defense. The most dominant
and consistent parts of the many phases of father's
life were his unusual drive and his fierce deter-
mination, He mastered, absolutely, many most
difficult skills, As an example: - In the early
twenties I listened to the spell-binding oratory
of William Jennings Bryan (no less) as he stood
on the front steps of the old Jesse Knight home
in Provo, Yet, by all methods of comparison, I
have heard my own father deliver some addresses
that out-classed Bryan's, Here's another example:--
In June, 1929, I returned from the German-Austrian
Mission, For thirty-one months my ears and tongue
had been accustomed to the sounds and pronuncia-
tions of the 'Deutsche Sprache (German language).
At the same time, I knew father's exposure to
German had been about nil for more than a decade
and I could hardly wait to test his supposed academic
knowledge of the language. When the opportunity
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 506

came, I proudly initiated the conversation. He
came back articulate, with grammatically perfect
German and, mind you, completely without an
English accent. I could hardly believe my ears,
Then, as his keen memory began to recall German
axioms and adages, which he quoted verbatim with
amazing ease and versatility, I found it much more
comfortable to change the whole subject. No ques-
tion about it, this man was a master.

"But great minds have master passions and
there's no denying that many strong men, in
adversity or under mental stress, have turned to
some perverted sort of habit or activity, dissipating
their time, talent and strength. Father was tested
with many circumstances and in a wide variety of
circles, but he was never enticed, But then again,
father was a man of great vision. Through the
annals of time many visionary men with the best of
intentions have been careless and even reckless in
fiscal matters, Of this, father was a classic
example. During the period of his life when his
dreams were mostly unfulfilled, he borrowed
heavily from many sources, Unfortunately, most
of his debts were never repaid. At the same time
he was most prudent in spending for himself or his
person, What he borrowed went into projects or
for travel, In his immense undertakings he probed
considerable chemical, metalurgical and scientific
fields, gathered endless samples, set out to dis-
cover mining deposits throughout the entire west
and procured numerous options and leases. Had
he succeeded in his projects he would have been
a hero and, believe me, anyone who had helped
him would have been rewarded handsomely.

"Father wanted to help rather than hurt
anyone. Always the ultimate betterment of others
was uppermost in his mind. I think he resented
secretly, as do others, many of the financial
limitations in our economic system which are
imposed upon so many. But for him resentment
wasn't enough; he took off in dead earnest to do
something about it, not by way of exploiting the
rich or by the political route of higher tax imposts
but through arduous and unrelenting struggle to
organize and develop dormant resources around
<span id="page-??"></span>

him, both tangible and intangible. He saw these
great needs - but he saw them too soon. Inthe

end he sacrificed his health and, literally, died
trying to achieve his objectives.

''In father's entire life there was nothing
half way. There were lofty peaks and there were
lowly valleys - but not much in between. He was
no ordinary person and he thought big. He retained
an abiding faith in God and, throughout his life,
boldly proclaimed the divine mission of Jesus
Christ, our Redeemer. With the exception of the
fiscal matters before mentioned, father upheld the
standards and principles of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints and sustained its
designated authorities. At their every call he
responded without question, Had he been asked,
I'm sure he would have traveled barefoot to
'Timbucktu!' In summary, Dear Descendants,
whether we cherish or disdain, this is all part of
heritage from our beloved progenitor and father,"

Lucile writes: "It was during my senior
year in High School and about Christmas time that
father passed away. I still remember the bleakness,
the cold, the sense of loss, In his last years we
had seen him bear the weight of illness and finan-
cial loss, but he bore them like aman. We never
saw him mean or complaining. Since then, time,
marriage, children and dreams of our own have
helped to erase the loss and total up the blessings:
Father loved us; he dreamed big and worked to
realize those dreams; he achieved greatly in the
fields of scholarship, culture, teaching and school
administration, '' And Edythe adds, "Perhaps his
death came as a grateful release ... who knows?
I like to feel that he is now unfettered, inspired
and enthusiastic in the work in which he was so
well qualified - so nobly endowed."

Sarah Jane Bartholomew (Christenson) wife
of Andrew 'B", was born in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah
Sept. 8, 1875, the daughter of John and Eliza Roxie
Metcalf Bartholomew. There were nine children
in the family. Fayette was a Mormon settlement
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 508

far removed from the bustling growth of Salt Lake
City and essentially dependent upon its own resources
for all commodities, The Bartholomew children
learned early to work, Food was raised, hunted

or fished for and then dried, smoked or pickled for
preservation, Sheep's wool was sheared, carded,
spun, dyed and knit or woven into clothing and
household articles, Furniture was made and rugs
were woven or braided and tacked over straw
matting for comfort and wear, Soap, starch, flour,
bread and sweets were all home prepared,

"Sarah's father was called to serve as
Bishop of the community when she was about two
years old; a position which he held until his death
in 1914, When death came to the community, the
Bishops fashioned the coffin from well seasoned
wood and his wife lined it with quilted cotton. (He
most likely presided at the funeral and preached
the sermon as well.) Tithing was paid in produce
to the Bishop as custodian for the Church, and
often went to feed the ever-present Indian. Later,
when the Manti Temple was being built, this tithing-
food was carried to feed the laborers who were
donating their time to its building.

"At the age of eight, Sarah's responsibility
of doing dishes began. She hated this task, and
with good reason; but without whining she carried
water from the irrigation ditch, heated it on the
wood burning stove and with lye-soap, brick
shavings and coarse muslin toweling, washed,
scoured:and dried. When she played or visited,
her freedom was restrained by a younger child to
tend or an inevitable stocking to knit, Such early
discipline prepared her for challenges to come.
She attended public school in Fayette and church
Seminary in Gunnison, where she first met Andrew
Christensen, Later she and her older sister Roxie
attended B, Y. A. in Provo, Utah, where she
became better acquainted with Andrew and was
courted by him there,'' When she married this
promising young college graduate (1 Juiy 1895)
and accompanied him to his first school position
in Kanab, Utah, their honeymoon trip was on an
open hayrack upon which their few belongings
jostled as they drove a team across the long, hot,
<span id="page-??"></span>

dusty primitive "road",

She was allowed to return to her parents'
home in Fayette for the birth of her first child and
son, Adelbert. Her first daughter, Edith (Edythe)
arrived while her husband was working for his
Masters degree at Ann Arbor, Michigan at the
turn of the century. Her third child, Wendell,
was also born at Fayette. The following year she
and the children were living in Provo, Utah while
Andrew was studying in Germany, when their child
Adelbert died of diphtheria before his father could
return. Her fourth child, Sheldon, was born in
Salt Lake City at the beginning of a happy and suc-
cessful almost six years, during which Andrew
served as Principal of the L. D. S. High School
there, It was three years after moving to Salt
Lake that her fifth child, Elsie Eliza, was born,
and less than two years later that this little one
was drowned and taken from her.

"To help assuage their grief and to enable
Andrew to continue his advanced studies, they
sold their lovely home where so much joy had
been theirs, and this last sorrow, and with the
-three remaining children left for Europe. In
preparation, Sarah had managed a large straw-
berry patch, with hired help and the children,
picking, crating and marketing the berries, Her
earnings were used in Europe gathering treasured
items for the many houses she was later to trans-
form into homes. Sarah loved this period of her
life. It was in Germany that her sixth child and
last son, Luther, was born (Leipzig). In Europe
she joined her husband in living or traveling in
England, Denmark, Germany and France (Paris)
while he was studying there. The day before they
were ready to return to the States, after a little
over a year in Europe, baby Luther was stricken
with pneumonia, Through prayer, and the skill of
a kind German doctor, the child was healed and
made the long return trip without further harm."
How grateful Sarah must have been to be spared
another parting with one of her remaining little
ones,

"Three years at Provo, where Andrew
taught at B. Y. U. and another daughter, Lucile,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 510

was born, followed by three more years living in
Rexburg, Idaho, where Andrew headed Ricks

Academy, passed by and with their passing the
taxing routine and confinement of administrative
work, coupled with a long-cherished dream of his
for further research, prompted Andrew to abandon
his profession temporarily for the fields of invest-
ment, promotion and speculation, He hoped there-
by to hasten his permanent retirement from both
teaching and business, making it possible for him

to have freedom to probe the fields of ancient lang-
uages and archeology with a view to scholarly sub-
stantiation of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.
Sarah too must have been wrapped up in his dreams
but, being of a more practical nature, must have
worried about pulling up stakes to engage in phantom
projects revolving around hot springs, dams and
such, especially with a family of children to provide
for,

A scholar and teacher but not a business man,
Andrew's dreams failed to materialize, one by one.
As his dreams retreated, so of necessity did Sarah's,
The secure, well-ordered and stimulating life of a
college administrator's wife were no longer for her.
Her disappointments were swallowed up in the next
pressing problems and the next challenging tasks -
LaVerkin - Hinckley - Star Ranch failure - the
lowly home on Jordan River - the red-brick house
on South Main Street. One of the most unhappy and
anxious periods of Sarah's life was when their
young, teenage son Luther disappeared from home
and was gone nearly two years, His safe return
brought joy and a closer cementing of family ties.
In her remaining years, Luther tried to make
things up to his mother in every conceivable way
possible, Are not our greatest blessings some-
times channeled through the gates of sorrow?

Sarah saw her husband's security disappear,
his health break, his plans fail - but never his
drive and determination. Though she did all she
could to help him control his diabetic condition, he
failed to cooperate when out of her sight, No
matter, his sudden death at age sixty-two and a
half was a terrible shock to both her and the
children, Margaret, their last born, writes:--
<span id="page-??"></span>
511 Andrew

"Mother was faced with raising us children who
were still at home with hardly any provided funds.
We were all made to realize the severity of the
problem and from the day we laid our father to
rest, there wasn't much childhood left for any

of us,"'

Not long before his death, Andrew had done
some work for a firm in California; from this
Sarah received $300.00. This, together with some
lots up Emigration Canyon, were all the financial
assets Andrew left to her. Sarah had long since
turned to her sewing skills to supplement their
income, Edythe was married. Wendell and Sheldon,
having returned from their missions which she had
financed by that sewing, were now on their own,
as was twenty-year-old Luther. With her two
remaining daughters, Lucile and Margaret, Sarah
faced the world and faced it bravely. She had
earlier borrowed money for the down payment on
a large old home on South Main Street, not far
from the red-brick home they had rented but which
had been practically sold out from under them,
Luther helped with the further financing of this
place. In fact, all her children were helpful and
wonderful to her in her widowhood. In this new
location she had continued her sewing business
and upon Andrew's death she added to her income
by boarding and rooming teachers from the nearby
high school. The two younger girls helped with
this,

"Sarah's veal cutlets and lemon meringue
pies, her freshly painted rooms with airy curtains
and snowy white linen, her yard with its varied
blooms and well kept garden, gave these people
a feeling of home away from home, and they
appreciated it, And although her days were long
and demanding, often continuing late into the night,
she never left her girls for outside employment.
Instead she took time and energy to walk with them
the mile to Liberty Park or ride the streetcar to
the end of the line 'just for fun'. On Saturday
nights, part of Sunday's dinner was prepared, best
clothes pressed and polished and the house left in
spotless order, The next day, the week's problems
and struggles were laid aside and the beautiful,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Andrew 512

reflective spirit of the Sabbath was kept. It was
then Sarah attended church and read to her girls,
or tried to, though she inevitably nodded and dozed;
and they, sensing her need for rest, were left to
revel in the peace of the day.

Sarah worked up quite a business making
Temple clothes, for which there was much demand.
But after many years with her sewing and several
with her boardinghouse, her eldest daughter,
Edythe, became seriously ill. By mutual agreement
Sarah and her two youngest daughters became a part
of Edythe's household in order to help in the care of
her five small children. Edythe had poor health for
years, during which time her mother managed her
household in the efficient way she always had her
own, But it was a worry for her to have Edythe
down so much. Part of a letter written by her
sister-in-law, Millie, to her daughter Gladys at
Christmas time 1943 tells something of this:

"| | I went to the hospital yesterday - took Aunt
Sarah with me, Edythe had another serious opera-
tion six weeks ago and as yet no one except her
family are allowed to see her, Aunt Sarah said
they had taken the nerves from her spine - she
seems awfully worried about her,"'

"From the early days of her marriage Sarah
was a participating member of the Relief Society
and many times served as its president in her
locality. No means are available to measure her
humanity through this organization, in visiting,
service, giving and sharing with people in need.
More readily observable, however, was her life-_
long trait of personal giving. From her gardens,
kitchen and sewing room came the gifts for her
generosity - the bouquet of flowers, the spicy pan
of rolls, or the embroidered pillow cases that
always had a way of finding the new mother, the
shut-in, or the grandchild.

"While home and Sarah were nearly synony-
mous, her mind continually sought the new, the
young and exciting, the current. She studied the
fashions and kept her wardrobe abreast of the day,
within the bounds of her maturity. Her most wel-
come visitors were her grandchildren and their
friends, who spoiled her with gay gifts and delighted
<span id="page-??"></span>

her with their chatter of ski trips, school challenges,
and romance, Though her eyes were poor in later
years and a magnifying glass was used to aid her
vision, she scanned the daily papers, following the
course of astronauts, the campaigns of politicians,
and the flow of general news, From these she
formed positive opinions which she candidly dis-
cussed with those around to listen, She was a
faithful and informed voter and a regular church
goer, always prepared on the assignments to be
handled, She kept her mind young and alert,

"Throughout life, Sarah exhibited a love for
adventure and daring. As a young wife she relished
the many travels with her husband, undaunted by
the inconveniences of her small children; at
seventy-two she accepted the challenge of chaperon-
ing a granddaughter on her year of study in New
York City and while there kept their apartment,
prepared their meals, served as Manhattan Ward
Relief Society Counselor, and audited an American
literature class at Columbia University. At age
eighty she accompanied a daughter's family ona
ten day camping trip and took an active part in
camp cooking, picture taking and sight seeing. At
eighty-six, though she then walked with a cane and
her hands trembled, her eyes still sparkled as she
went places and did things people thought impossible
for her; for example: Solicitous of her health, it
was suggested that she 'skip' attendance at Provo
High's performance of 'The Merchant of Venice’,
of which a granddaughter was student director,
because this involved a hundred miles of night
travel. But she made the trip and her greeting
to the young girl was, ‘Susie, I didn't let you
down!' Such was the self discipline, active
humanity and courageous daring of the old yet
young Sarah B, Christenson, who crossed the time
bridge between pioneer era and space age with both
mind and spirit in step, "'

Her daughter Edyth and husband Dr, Burtis,
had long since provided Sarah with lovely quarters
adjacent to their own, and she remained a part of
their household until well into her eighty-ninth year.
Then Edyth was stricken with a heart attack and
was no longer able to look out for her mother.

Sarah was sent to be with Luther and his wife in
California. But she missed Salt Lake City so was
returned there and placed in a ''Guest Home’,
where she was given a room with her own furniture
and treasures about her, She passed away shortly
after that, 23 Apr. 1966, at age eighty-nine years
seven months and fifteen days. Her funeral was
held 26 Apr. 1966 at 12 noon in the East Millcreek
Stake center and her burial took place the same day
in Provo City Cemetery beside her husband.

(3) JOSEPH "'C'' CHRISTENSEN

Joséph, third son of Laurs and Else K,
Christensen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah
Tuesday 7 Mar. 1871. He was christened plain
Joseph, but in early manhood he assumed the middle
initial ''C'' which he seldom ever used, and changed
the last part of the original spelling of his surname
from ''sen!''! to ''son"', unofficially however. When
he was going on four years old he and his father,
mother and two older and one younger brother
moved a few miles southeast from Gunnison to
North Mayfield, where they joined in the '' United
Order'' experiment. When the "'Order'' dissolved
the family moved across Twelve Mile Creek to
South Mayfield and his father bought a home there.
This home is still standing and in good condition

(1968).

Joseph received his first lessons in reading,
spelling and numbers at his mother's knee, while
she was spinning, weaving, knitting or doing other
household tasks, He first attended school in South
Mayfield and excelled as a student.

Accounts of him and his brothers roaming
the hills there, swimming in Twelve Mile Creek,
riding their Indian pony, helping on their father's
farm and even raiding the Bishop's watermelon
patch, are given in earlier pages of this book.
Fishing was another thing he enjoyed in Mayfield,
and visiting nearby Indian camps to wrestle with
young Indian boys his own age, He was a strong,
well-built young fellow. There were cold winters

in Mayfield when their stock died and difficult
times when the family had little to eat. But there
was always plenty of love and kindness to go around
in his family and very little squabbling.

The family moved back to Gunnison when
Joseph was nine years old (1880) and he was bap-
tized a member of the L, D. S, Church there later
on that year. His Danish mother wrote about this
in her journal:-- 'Joseph Christensen, fod (born)
den 7 March 1871 i Gunnison, dobt (baptized) den
25 July 1880, of Thomas William Hansen of (and)
Konfermeret (confirmed) of P, W. Blom, samme
dag (same day).'' Of all of Laurs and Else Chris-
tensen's sons Joseph was perhaps the most con-
sistent in his attendance and activity in the church,
Possibly it was because his work didn't take him
away from home as much as the others, However,
he was ofa rather solemn and determined nature,

Joseph attended grade school in Gunnison,
He had an experience with one of his teachers one
year, of which his brother Albert writes, (This
took place in early spring of 1888):-- "My brother
Joseph, who was just older than I, looked after
the firing of the stove at school with my help, It
was our duty to have the school rooms warm inthe morn-
ings and during the school days. That school year
was especially short for the two of us, Joseph and
two other boys about his age, Frank Metcalf and
Arthur Johnson, had broken some rule of the
teacher, Oscar Berglund, Perhaps it was a
failure to be properly prepared or something of
that sort. By way of punishment they had been
ordered to copy a certain number of pages from
a certain book before going home from school,
These pupils apparently had some understanding
between themselves that they would refuse to write
the verses, I hadn't been advised by Joseph that
he would not write the verses, so I remained on
the school ground to wait for him, The teacher
had a large ruler, or stick, which he used to
Support his authority, He was a man of more than
usual determination and this was perhaps the first
time such determination had really been put to the
test, :

"The teacher first went to Metcalf, as Iwas
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 516

later told, and gave him the choice of taking a
licking or writing the verses. Berglund was a big
man and he had a big stick. As he stood there with
the ultimatum to write "or else'! it was too much
for Metcalf; he commenced to write. When John-
son was confronted with decision after having seen
the surrender of his ally, he also commenced to
write, The teacher was wise in not taking Joseph
on first, for when he was given the alternative he
refused to write. ‘Hold out your hand' the teacher
commanded, Joseph's hand came out without hesi-
tation, There were three vicious whacks! Joseph's
hand remained out but the teacher turned and walked
to his desk, Joseph took his hat and his books and
started for the door, and as he walked past the desk
he threw the school keys down. That was the end of
that school year for both of us.

''We notified our mother that we had quit
school. Notwithstanding her urging us to go back
we stood firm. She didn't belabor or command us
but said, gently and firmly, ‘You will then grub and
burn the greasewood on the north of the forty.' This
we proceeded to do in spite of the development of
blistered hands and sunburned faces and necks."
This must have been double punishment for Joseph
since he usually liked school so much. He loved to
learn and during his leisure moments one seldom
saw him without a book in his hands,

The summer of 1889 or 1890 Joseph and Albert
worked on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad
which was being brought into Sanpete County. They
secured jobs with one William Harris, a contractor
who had a contract to construct the grade between
Sterling and Gunnison. Mr, Harris finished his job
in Sanpete County early in the summer and moved
from there to the vicinity of Eureka. After his
outfit moved, Joseph and his brother got jobs from
a man by the name of Crandall, who had a contract
finishing the grade south of the Harris job. They
ran scrapers, drove teams and were somewhat
looked down upon at times by the hot-headed Irish-
men who operated the big drillers and shovels. But
no matter; the money they earned was used to
further their educations.

Joseph worked in summers but in winters he
<span id="page-??"></span>
517 Joseph

went to schools He graduated from the Gunnison
Public Schools with high honors and then took a
preparatory course at the Snow Academy at ;
Ephraim, Utah. It became his ambition to achieve
a high standing in the educational world and to this
his efforts were.devoted. His mother went to Den-
mark the early fall'of 1890 to:see her people, and
‘that winter Joseph attended the Gunnison Seminary
which was-sponsored by the L...D. S.: Church school
system, In the autumn of 1891, with two brothers
and a sister, he entered the Brigham Young Aca
demy at Provo, Utah, where they hoped to ‘obtain :
their.college.degrees.. All four ofthem +. Andrew,
Albert, Elsie and Joseph - Sventuatly graduated
from there.

It was in Gunnison that Joseph first: met Roxie
Bartholomew of Fayette and later: they both attended
Snow Academy at Ephraim and'the Gunnison: Semin-
ary at the same time. ‘They became very intérested
in each other. Roxie, together with her’ yotinger =
sister Sarah, also attended'B. Y. A: at Provo the
winter of 1890/91. It was here-that Joseph's: and:
Roxie's courtship: flourished andi blossomed; ‘almost
within the shadow of beautiful Mt, Timpanogos, ~
Roxie was .an efficient little: dark-haired, round-—

. faced miss of English descent, while Joseph was a
bit-over-six-feet tall, blond, curly*headed youth’

of full-blooded Danish extraction. Now today it is
fashionable to be descended from the early Vikings,
but in those college. days the greatest insult.one |
could give a fellow was to call him "a great big. -
Dane''or 'a great big overgrown Swede", or $0
we have been told. Nevertheless, Roxie fellin
love with Joseph, Danish heritage and all, andthe
two were married Sept. 6, 1893 in the Manti Temple.
‘This was the first of three marriages between the.
-Christensens and the Fayette Bartholomews.’ Later,
Roxie's younger sister, Sarah, married: “Joseph's
older brother Andrew, and still later the girls’
younger brother Alma matried the boys" olde st.
sister, Elsie.

Following Joseph's graduation. from, B..Y.A.
(later B. Y. U.) he first taught, school in Center-
field, but lived in Gunnison near by. Here he .
rented two rooms in the Bardsley home, corner of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 518

First North and Second West. This home is still
standing (1968) but now unoccupied and dilapidated,
It was here that their first child Harold was born,
21 Oct. 1894. Likely Joseph's mother Else, who
lived close by, assisted as midwife at that birth.
Roxie always had a hard time having her babies.
She had two more little ones while they were then
living in Gunnison, The first of these, little Roxie
Irene, lived only six weeks (6 Nov. 1896-18 Dec.
1896) and the second, Royal Milton, a month and
eleven days (14 Jan. 1898-25 Feb. 1898) (There
is some confusion now among various members of
the family as to the exact dates of these two births
and deaths - more research should be done. )

Joseph's next teaching assignment, following
the births and deaths of these two babies, was in
Redmond. Harold wrote of this in his history:--
"My first recollections, as a real small child of
about five years, were in Redmond, Utah, a very
small town in Sevier County about ten miles south
of Gunnison, where both my father and mother
taught school. I remember trying to keep up with
the older boys of the neighborhood while playing
'Follow-Jack' and trying to jump.a wide ditch, as
they did. Iwould get wet and then would get my
legs whipped with my wet stockings that had buttons
on the top, and that didn't feel so good,

"The next winter the folks went over to Vernal,
Utah in the Uinta Basin to teach. They loaded our
belongings in a large buggy and we started out by
way of Salina Canyon, I don't remember how many
nights we camped out but the morning after the first
one, father was sure someone had come in the
night and turned our buggy around, Of course it
wasn't the buggy but father that was turned around,
but he wouldn't admit that he was wrong. He made
me a 'flipper' while on that trip. After two years
of teaching in Vernal we went back to Gunnison to
stay and father became principal of the public
school there.'"'

Another baby was born to Joseph and Roxie
that first winter back in Gunnison. But little
La Faun, born 27 Feb. 1901, only lived two and a
half months and then passed away, 13 May 1901.
Thus they had lost three little ones straight ina

row and all were laid to rest in the Gunnison Ceme-
tery. Though infant mortality was much higher in
those early days than it is today, still this must
have been most disheartening to this couple and
they must have begun to wonder if they would ever
have another child to raise besides Harold,

Joseph soon had their first very-own home
built in Gunnison and they were able to move in
sometime before their fifth child and first daugh-
ter, Ruth Ellen, was born, 7 Oct. 1902. (Details
of her birth appear in another chapter.) Harold
remembered well when that house was being built.
They were then living part of the time in Fayette
with his Bartholomew grandparents, but he used
to come in from there and play about, jumping and
sometimes stumbling over the rubber hoses with
which the workmen were watering down the cement
and, as he said, ''getting into mischief in general",

This house is still standing in Gunnison (1969)
and from the outside appearance, still in good con-
dition though changed some, How well I remember
going there with my parents as a youngster, or
again with father on his way past there to our
Gunnison Ranch. Uncle Joseph and Aunt Roxie had
lots of cows, horses, pigs, chickens and even
turkeys on their place and plenty of milk, cream
and eggs for any use, There were heaps of corn
on the cob and fresh tomatoes in season, for they
always had the best of vegetable gardens, and
there was often chicken soup with dumplings, made
the Danish way. Aunt Roxie was a splendid cook
and so friendly and ''chatty'". Uncle Joseph, if he
were home, was usually sitting in a big chair
reading. He seemed to me to be a man of few
words, but when he spoke it was with wisdom and
deliberation. My younger sister, Cousin Ruth
Ellen's age, thought him overly stern for he
sometimes got after them for making too much
noise, or doing this or that. But then, perhaps
Ruth Ellen and Ellen Elaine needed a little "telling"
on occasions, My, how they used to pound on that
piano !

_ Though Joseph may have seemed stern to
some at times, because of his sober and deliberate
way of speaking, yet he was by habit most loving
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 520

and kind, not only to his family, friends and asso-
ciates but to the less fortunate as well, His son
Virgil remembers their mother Roxie telling about
how good their father always was to the many
Indians that came through Gunnison begging in
those early days. He never turned them down but
always gave them flour, meat, fruit, potatoes, or
anything else he had on hand. He was also very
generous and considerate of the Japanese people
who often worked for him on his farm west of
Gunnison, raising sugar beets, etc. He built
them a farm house on his land by Rocky Point,

in which to live.

Beneath Joseph's somber surface bubbled an
ever-ready ''dry wit!'', much like his father's,
Virgil tells a story that is typical of this:-- "Joseph
went down town to a movie one night in Gunnison
and slept through the whole show. When he came
out he asked the manager, Mr. Duggins, for his
money back. Duggins of course wanted to know
the reason and Joseph said, 'If a show isn't good
enough to keep a fellow awake it isn't worth the
money, '!

Joseph never neglected his church duties.
The early Gunnison Ward records show that he was
born 7 Mar. 1871; blessed 6 Apr. 1871 by Jens
Jensen; bapt. 25 July 1880 by Thomas Williams
and confirmed the same day by F. W. Blom;
ordained a Deacon, then a Teacher and finally a
Priest in the Aaronic priesthood, the latter being
7 Jan. 1893. Other L. D. S. church records
indicate that Joseph was ordained an Elder in the
Melchizedek priesthood 3 Sept, 1893 by James
Jensen; ordained a Seventy 21 Nov. 1893 by Brig-
ham H, Roberts, and on 10 Aug. 1902 he was
ordained to the office of High Priest by George
Teasdale, The same day he was set apart as
Second Counselor to Bishop A, C. Madsen in the
Gunnison Ward bishopric. In 1903 he was ordained
a Bishop and set apart to preside over the Gunnison
Ward as its fifth bishop, This calling he filled well
for nine years, Later he became a member of the
Gunnison Stake High Council and also an active
member of Gunnison Stake High Priests quorum,
and was serving as that organization's class leader
<span id="page-??"></span>
521 Joseph
at the time of his death. .

Joseph Christensen (son) was also very |
prominent in the civic affairs of both Gunnison and
Gunnison Valley. He served as Gunnison's Mayor,
or Town President as it was then called, for two
terms of two years each. It was during his tenure
of office, Sept. 1909, that Gunnison obtained the
franchise making it a third class city. About the
same time the Gunnison water system 'was created.
In December that year a law was passed limiting
the tax allowed in the area to the valuation of the
property. In March 1910, also while Joseph was
Mayor, the electric power company brought lights
to Gunnison, His was a productive administration.

Some of Joseph's other public services
included being secretary to the Board of Directors
of the Gunnison Valley Bank; secretary for the South
Sanpete District School Board; secretary of the
Gunnison Telephone Company; a member of the
Board of Sanpete County Commissioners; president
ofthe Sanpete-Sevier Beet Growers Association,
and head of the Gunnison Valley Swine Breeders |
Association, Indeed he held many public positions
of trust during his lifetime, for he was a worker
and he loved to serve, a :

Joseph owned a fine farm east of Gunnison,
He had a nice three-room house with a front porch
built on this farm to house an occasional overseer
or laborer and his family. In fact we understand
it was first built for a Danish emigrant cousin of
his father's, her husband and two daughters, when
said husband, Niels Jensen, was given employment
there by Joseph. Harold eventually took over this
farm and told about it in his history:-- ''Before
being married I had worked with father on the farm
during school and in summers, After Herma and I
were married we first lived in town, but moved to
the farm | Jan, 1919 when our first baby, Cloyd,
was six months old, We raised sugar beets, sheep
and cattle.'' Today that east farm is still in the
Christensen family, being owned by Harold's son,
Keller, and now one of the finest cattle farms in
the area. But Joseph owned and developed other
farming land around Gunnison Valley and, according
to his son Myron, it was one of his greatest
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 522

ambitions to be able to give to each of his sons, in
turn, a productive, well-stocked farm of his own,
as he had done Harold.

However, Joseph's main work during the
better part of his lifetime was school work, and
how he loved it. He was in the classroom, either
as a student or ateacher, for forty-five years.
During that time he studied much of the time to
keep abreast of things. It has been said that one
seldom saw him sit down without a book in his |
hands, Truly, he was a great reader, student and
teacher as well, for from his early youth it had
been one of his great ambitions to achieve a high
standing in the educational world, and to this he
had devoted much of his time.

He gave up the classroom sometime near the
period that ended the First World War. He had
decided to go forward in the direction of another
ambition, that of developing and stocking his other
farms with a view to getting them in order for his
boys yet inthe home. This done, he undoubtedly
planned to settle down to some of his own personal
projects and begin to realize his dreams for him-
self and Roxie. There was a great feeling of specu-
lation in the air then. People were venturing
financially on all sides. War prices were still on
and things looked rosy ahead. Joseph decided to
feed lambs on quite a scale for the then excellent
market. He borrowed thousands of dollars to buy
them. He also invested in some hogs, in hopes of
benefiting there also. Harold said that his father
figured that if he were successful in this venture
he could retire from his labors by the time he was
fifty-five and then spend his time doing the things
he himself longed to do.

But Joseph never realized this ambition for
the bottom fell out of everything and the market
crashed, Instead he lost heavily. This was a
great blow to him from which he never quite
recovered, Nevertheless, he turned over his
much-loved home and some other property to his
creditors and moved his family to the "Rocky .
Point" farm house he had earlier built for some
Japanese. Roxie made it as comfortable as
possible, Here they continued feeding a few sheep
<span id="page-??"></span>
523 Joseph

and hogs, as well as a flock of chickens, in hopes
of making some sort of a ''come-back"", Joseph
engaged in a number of projects, one of which was
organizing a Swine Breeders Association to help
step up the quality and price of hogs. Indeed he
did all he could to get things going for them again -
but he was terribly discouraged.

The youngest son, Don, who was then about
five and unaware of the real situation, tells some-
thing about this period in his own history, as
follows:-- "At the time of my birth the family was
residing within the Gunnison City limits but my
recollections of the home there are vague. My
first clear recollection of home is of the farm
house down below Rocky Point, a mile or so west
of Gunnison, Of this place I have many fond
memories: - father working in the garden, helping
mother with the chickens and around the house; me
exploring the hills in the neighborhood, riding
horseback, playing in the sand dunes and helping
on the farm. I remember helping with the pigs,
Chester Whites they were, and when the creek of
water just above our homestead would start to dry
up and water was no longer running in the Sanpitch
River below, it was my job to salvage and carry
enough water from the creek to keep the hogs
relatively content. I have a vivid recollection of
those hot summer days - the buckets that seemed
always too large - and the thirsty livestock."

Marvin well remembers helping his father
feed lambs there at Rocky Point, both before and
after this ill-fated venture. He said what his
father lost was not a staggering amount when com-
pared with the money available today, but then in
those hard-to-get-money days, thousands of dollars
was a fortune when you lost it and enough to change
the course of all their lives. He himself was in his
later teens at the time and had been working hard
at the project, with his father, and looking forward
to owning a farm of his own, This failure was hard
on the young as well as the old,

Life went on at Rocky Point nevertheless and
the experience drew the family closer together.
This is not to say that there were never any little
family squabbles, however, Virgil tells a story
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 524

his mother used to tell of those days which might
be called, 'There's more than one way to skina
cat'', She and Joseph had decided that they. should
have some trees on their place there at Rocky
Point, but for the life of them they. couldn't agree
on where to plant them. Finally Joseph just went
ahead and planted some where he wanted them and
Roxie let him go ahead and do it and said no more
about the affair. But then she went outside after
that for a little while each day, when Joseph wasn't
around, and gave each of the newly planted trees a
real good shove. Roxie always ended this story by
saying, '. . . And do you know - not one of those
trees ever grew!!!

We passed that place near Rocky Point the
summer of 1967, There were no trees standing
there and in fact not the slightest indication that
even a house had ever stood there. It was a dry
and barren place. Harold was with us and pointed
out the spot where his folks had lived some forty
years or so ago - but only rocks and dirt were there,

Joseph grew more quiet as the days went by
and also somewhat listless. It was evident that he
was not entirely well; yet he kept plugging along
and complained little, if at all, Then, about the
forepart of July 1926 he came down with an extreme,
though then undetermined, illness which took him
to his bed right away. He seemed to know then that
he was nearing his end. Roxie must have realized
it too. She said that in this last illness Joseph's
mind was so clear that he could figure out the
answers to problems that had perplexed him for
years,

As his daughter Ruth Ellen sat by his bedside
_ grieving one day, he told her that death was like
waking on a warm morning in June - and he did so
dislike winter! And when he was very, very ill
and close to death and his brother Andrew stood
beside his bed, he told him that he had been close
enough to death, in that last illness, to know what
was coming; and he likened death unto ''meeting

a morning star'',

Joseph died in the farmhouse near Rocky
Point, 23 July 1926. Strange to say, he was exactly

fifty-five years four months and sixteen days old
when he finally retired from his life's labors,
Some said he died of a broken heart, but Myron
said it was thought to have been a bursted stomach
ulcer followed by a number of complications and
ending with pneumonia. He was buried in the
Gunnison City Cemetery 25 July 1926,

His funeral, held on the above date, was well
attended by people from all walks of life. Many
had been his students or co-workers. Here,
among the many other tributes, were read two sets
of resolutions of respect, one from the officials
of Sanpete County and the other from the High
Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake. We quote
them in that order:--

"Whereas, there has been lost to Sanpete
County one of the members of the Board of County
Commissioners who has devoted not only his labor
and his energy but also his mind and heart to the
doing of tasks imposed on him and voluntarily
assumed by him; Whereas, the nature and character
of the services rendered by Joseph Christensen to
the public in the many capacities in which he has
served were such as to reflect credit on the entire
community and be a splendid example for all
employees to admire; be it .

---Resolved: that we, the officials of Sanpete
County, desire to express officially our admiration
for Joseph Christensen, as a man and as a public
servant; and as a token of our respect and esteem,
that a copy of this resolution be spread upon the
records of Sanpete County and that a copy be pre-
sented to his family, Be it further Resolved, that
we offer our sincerest condolence to Mr. Christen-
sen's family in this hour of their bereavement."!
(Respectfully submitted, dated and signed, by

Geo. E, Cook, Chairman. }

'Whereas, in the wisdom of our Heavenly
Father, our Brother and class leader, Joseph
Christensen, has been called from this sphere of
action and advanced to a higher sphere where his
splendid talents and powers will not be limited;
and Whereas, his departure has left a vacant place
in the High Priests Quorum which will be hard to
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 526

fill; therefore be it Resolved: that we tender to the
bereaved family of our departed member our
heartfelt sympathy and call their attention to the
great work their father is now beginning, the union
on the other side and the welcome he will receive
from relatives and friends who have gone before;
and be it further Resolved: that a copy of these
resolutions be given to the sorrowing family, and
also that they be placed upon the records of the
High Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake."

Among the numerous characteristics and
qualities Joseph had inherited from his predecessors
was a quiet, dignified and deliberate mien from his
father, as well as a handsome head of curly hair,
and a great thirst for knowledge, both secular and
religious, from his mother. He was a great theo-
logian as well as scholar and he used his wisdom
and knowledge for the benefit of others. He was a
tall man. He left the world five tall sons, each as
tall or taller than he, and one lovely daughter who
has been a great comfort to all of them over the
years - and he left a wise and loving wife and
mother to his children, as well as to other children
wherever she was privileged to serve.

His daughter Ruth, in writing of her father,
says: "I feel that father's life can be best summed
up in these words taken from an editorial which
appeared in the local newspaper soon after his
death.'' Thus we conclude his history by quoting
that editorial supplied by Ruth:--

‘In the death of Joseph Christensen last week,
Sanpete County, the Gunnison Valley and Gunnison
lo st one of their real substantial and progressive
citizens. And these citizens - men, women and
children - bowed their heads in sorrow and mourned
his death, deeply and sincerely. His broad mind,
his liberal thoughts, his goodness, endeared him
to all who knew him and he was held in the highest
esteem by thousands of warm friends and admirers.

"In his public life he proved efficient, honest,
and was trusted. He occupied offices of trust and
was placed there for his integrity, efficiency and
honesty; and never once was the finger of criticism
pointed at him. Joseph Christensen was a scholar
<span id="page-??"></span>
527 Joseph

and a student. He had one aim, to reach the highest
pinnacle, and his life was taken just as he was pre-
pared to start his real life's work. He was loved
and he loved all, whether Mormon, Jew or Gentile,

''A cloud of sorrow in the calling of this good
and friendly citizen will hang heavily and thousands
of friends will forever cherish his memory. '!

Roxie Ellen Bartholomew (Christensen) wife of
Joseph, born 30 Mar, 1872 in Fayette, Sanpete,
Utah, the daughter of John and Eliza Roxie Metcalf
Bartholomew. We are fortunate to have had the
following history of her submitted by her sister-
in-law, Catharine Decker (Mrs, Henry L.)
Bartholomew; she titles it ''Aunt Roxie!" , °
"This is the name she had for the last twenty years
of her life; people really didn't know her by any
other name, especially the youngsters of Fayette
and Gunnison, The school teachers who came to
Fayette still speak of her as Aunt Roxie. Her own
brothers and sisters speak of her as Aunt Roxie.
Her world was made up of nieces and nephews,
both old and young.

"She was born in the log house where her
parents lived the first few years after their
marriage - she was their second child and oldest
daughter, She could remember her father building
the new rock house, They moved into it before it
was finished so that her younger sister Sarah could
be bornthere, Gradually their new house was
finished - the parlor being completed last. The
carpet they put on the parlor floor was hand-woven.
Roxie's grandmother Bartholomew (Polly Benson)
helped her mother Eliza wash, card, spin, dye
and weave the wool of which it was made. This
parlor was a very special room, entered only on
Sundays when the members of the family were
dressed in their best and clean from their Satur-
day night baths. It was here that her father read
the scriptures; here that they knelt in family
prayers on the straw padded carpet - that was
luxury! This room was heated by a fireplace
which is still in the room at the present (1968),
<span id="page-??"></span>

The woodwork about the side and the mantle are
the same that her father John made some ninety
years ago.

"Roxie remembered their first great family
tragedy. It was the latter part of October 1878 -
she was six and a half. Her oldest brother, John,
nearly nine was very sick with 'membranous croup’,
Elder John Mellor was called to the home to
administer to and bless the child. He gave John
the blessing of health, but as he turned to leave he
said to her mother: 'Eliza, I can't tell you that
William will live.' He had reference to Roxie's
young brother, age four, who was sitting on the
floor playing and apparently in the best of health.
John recovered but in two days William was dead.
Roxie remembered their sorrow.

''When Roxie was about eight years old her
mother was making apricot jam and asked her to
see if it was cool. She tried to lift the large pan
and upset it, spilling the hot jam all over herself
from her neck down to her legs, She was badly
burned and it took a long time to heal the resulting
sores,

"Eleven children were born to that Bartholo-
mew family and Roxie helped her mother as any
pioneer daughter should, She was about twelve
years old when her mother got a 'home' sewing
machine, Eliza wasn't used to this quick way of
hemming sheets so she put Roxie to it. Though
her mother tried to show her how, Roxie did it
her own way, behind her mother's back, and soon
learned all the tricks of cutting and sewing and her
mother knew she was the better of the two, child
though she was.

"Her father was Presiding Elder and then
Bishop of Fayette for many years (about forty-
seven in all), For some time the end of the rail-
road was at the Juab terminal of York, some fifteen
miles north of Fayette. When the authorities of the
church had conference appointments south of Juab,
they would put their horses and carriages on the
train, unload them at York and drive to Bishop
Bartholomew's to spend the night, or at least rest
their animals for a time in his big barn that always
<span id="page-??"></span>
529 Joseph
seemed to have hay enough and to spare.

"Apostle Wilford Woodruff was a favorite in
the Bartholomew home, especially with the child-
ren. He was asleep upstairs at their place when,
in July of 1887, a rider came from York on horse-
back, trying to find Apostle Woodruff to tell him
to come back to Salt Lake because President Taylor
had passed away. (Wilford Woodruff was then
President of the Quorum of the Twelve and twenty-
one months later, April 1889, he was elevated to
the presidency of the church, ).

"Roxie remembered hearing of her grand-
parents being at the meeting in Nauvoo when the
mantle of Joseph Smith fell on Brigham Young.
Her grandpa had said, 'It is the Prophet. - it looks
like him - it sound like him!'! He had left his seat
in the Bowery where the conference was being
held, 8 Aug. 1844, and gone around front to the
speakers' stand, He came back and said to his
wife, with great conviction, 'We will follow Brig-
ham Young to the ends of the earth!

"At one time Roxie's mother had a terrible
abcess on her neck, She had a houseful of company
from Salt Lake and the visiting Elders gave her a
blessing, Next morning, after the Elders were fed
and on their way south to their assignment, Eliza
thought of her neck, The pain was gone and healing
had started,

"Roxie met Joseph Christensen in Gunnison.
They both went to the Snow Academy at Ephraim
at the same time and then attended the Gunnison
Seminary, where she was appointed Girls! Matron,
They attended Brigham Young Academy at Provo
the same time also and here is where their court-
ship took a serious turn, They were married 6
Sept. 1893 inthe Manti Temple, the first marriage
among the children of both families, Later, as we
have been told before, two others of the Bartholo-
mews married two other Christensens. Roxie and
Joseph's was a very happy marriage, Nine child-
ren were born to this union. Three died in infancy
and were buried in the Gunnison City Cemetery.

"Ruth Ellen was Roxie's and Joseph's fifth
child and the first following the three little ones
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 530

who died, one right after the other a few weeks
after their births. Her grandmother Christensen
was in attendance at her birth, the dramatic story
of which has been given in an earlier part of this
book, Ruth was always very dear to her parents,
as she has always been to her various brothers
and their families.

'In the early years after her marriage,
Roxie always went back to her childhood home in
Fayette at Christmastime to make things happy
there. She was a jolly sort of person and such
excellent company. She always had some joke or
'Christmas treat', especially made for her brothers,

"Roxie loved to sew. She made everything -
children clothes, fancy dresses, suits, coats,
sweaters, wedding dresses, boys pants, and
numerous sets of burial clothes. She did most of
her mother-in-law Else's sewing and that for Vena
and Tresia until they left the Christensen home.
She kept Ruth Ellen looking like a little princess,
She was a master at 'making things over'., (In fact,
as Ruth Ellen said, ''She was a wonderful seam-
stress"),

"Roxie fed her big family the very best of
food, Joseph and their oldest son, Harold, used
to kill as high as fifty wild ducks in one hunt and
for the season they would supply a set number
every day to a Salt Lake market; killing, cleaning
and dressing them and putting a specified number
on the north going train each day. Joseph and
Roxie cleaned the ducks and as they were busy
cleaning, a cake made ina big black dripper-pan
by Roxie could easily walk out of the house, a piece
at a time, in the hands of her five hungry boys,
She always had room in her house, at her table
and in her heart for 'one more' even if that one
happened to be 'ten'. Alma Fredrickson, a boy
about Harold's age who needed a home, lived at
their home for nine years and became almost like
a son to them and a brother to Harold,

"Following the death of her husband, Joseph,
23 July 1926, Roxie continued to live in their home
just west of Rocky Point with her four unmarried
sons. Myron was married the next spring, 13 Apr.
<span id="page-??"></span>
531 Joseph

1927, and then there were just the three boys left;
Virgil 18, Marvin 153, and Don 10; In early
November of 1928 Roxie went to Fayette to help
her brother Henry put up his fruit, his wife Ireta
having passed away late that summer leaving him
alone with three small sons to care for; Homer 7,
Keith 5 and John 35. She never went back to Rocky
Point to live long. Soon she began to bring her
chickens and barnyard animals and her household
goods back to the old homestead and the Old Rock
House she had watched and helped her father build
in her childhood, She moved in with her brother
Henry and his boys, who then occupied the old
place,"

Don tells something of this move:-- ''Some-
time after father's death we moved from our Rocky
Point home to Fayette, Utah, a distance of about
six miles. Uncle Henry had lost his wife and been
left with three young sons, He invited mother and
her family to come and live with him, they being
brother and sister, and she accepted. I recall
that my job in the moving was to take a horse and
drive our milch cow, 'Old Jerse', to our new
home, To me at the time it seemed a great
adventure and undertaking to set forth alone below
the foothills of Fayette.

"The arrangement to combine families worked
out with little friction and with great benefit to all
concerned, Mother soon became 'Aunt Roxie! to
her nephews, as well as all the other children in
town; and Uncle Henry, with his gentleness and
patience, became a second father to me.'"' Ruth
Ellen adds:-- ''Mother took her three youngest
boys and went to help Uncle Henry raise his three
motherless sons, She stayed with him twenty years;
it was the most beautiful brother-sister relationship
Ihave ever seen. She became 'Aunt Roxie! to
everyone in Fayette - she had so much love to give !"'

Catherine continues her history:-- ''Roxie
made many people happy with presents of Danish
dumplings, Danish meatballs or Danish sweet-
soup, which she undoubtedly learned to make from
her Danish mother-in-law, Else, She could cook
mutton to a 'queen's taste', Many of her friends
would say, 'We don't like mutton', but after a meal
<span id="page-??"></span>
Joseph 532

at her table these very ones would say, 'What
delicious meat - what is it?' It was mutton,

"She made her own yeast and bread - cakes,
pies, butter, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese and
head cheese, She made sausage and cured hams
and bacon, Always she had a garden of wonderful
flowers and vegetables, She would have cantaloupe
enough from her garden each fall for a Fayette
'town treat" Ruth Ellen adds to this:-- "Always
her hands were busy. Her hoe was her cane - no
weeds could show their heads in her large garden
and live,"'

Catherine continues:-- 'She always had
chickens to supply eggs, chicken for Sunday dinners
and 'egg money'. She stuffed them for roasting with
bread and sage dressing. She raised turkeys, ducks
and geese, She kept her youngest son, Don, on his
mission with her 'egg money', She was always on
the giving end of life.

"Roxie was a wonderful mother to Henry's
three boys, as well as her own. It was a sad
experience for her when Henry's middle boy, Keith,
died after two operations (1937), He had always
been so kind and courteous to her. She had been
in Henry's home some thirteen years when he was
married to his second wife, Catherine Decker. She
stayed on seven more years to help mother two more
of Henry's sons by this second marriage.

"In October 1948 she moved back to Gunnison
and went to live with her oldest son, Harold, and
his second wife, Stella. Henry and Catherine
moved from Fayette back to Gunnison, 3 June 1949.
One room in their new home was designated as ‘Aunt
Roxie's room!', but she never came back to live in
it. She died in Gunnison Hospital 5 Jan. 1952 and
was buried beside her husband and three infant
children in the Gunnison Cemetery. Apostle James
E. Talmage once said, 'All you can hold in your
cold, dead hands is what you have given away'. If
this be so, then Roxie's hands were full enough to
last for eternities,"

Aunt Roxie was indeed a good woman. For
most of the later part of her almost eighty years
she suffered from crippling arthritis, yet she kept
<span id="page-??"></span>
533 Joseph

cheerful and seldom complained, never gave up,
neither did she let this painful affliction keep her
from her services of love. She was active in each
of the auxiliary organizations of the church in one
way or another, from time to time, besides filling
the demanding service as the wife of a busy Bishop
and life-long public servant. By far her greatest
role, however, must certainly have been that of
an understanding, loving mother and kind friend,
not only to her own children but to all who came
her way in need of tender care and affection.

(4) ALBERT "H" CHRISTENSEN

None can successfully dispute the claim that
Albert, like the rest of these Christensens, was
of pure Danish descent back to the fearless Vikings
of Old, and even beyond, Although his parents, |
Laurs and Else K. Christensen, were transplanted
from Little Denmark to the great western land they
called "Zion", a little more than six years before
his birth, and he was born an American citizen,
still the blood of the ancient. Norsemen ran strong
in his veins,

His mothe r recorded his birth in her journal
thus;-- "'Alberth Chresten fod den 13 Dec; 1872 i*
Gunnison,"' So it was Albert Christen Christensen
he was named and blessed inthe L. D. S, church
in Gunnison, Utah, by Bishop Joseph S, Horne, 2
Jan. 1873, when he was twenty days old. He was
his parents’ only ''winter' baby and the first born
to them "lin the covenant",

Albert seldom used the middle name Christen,
likely given him for his grandfather, and in early
manhood dropped it altogether and assumed the
middle initial 'H'., Like some of his older brothers
he also changed the spelling of the last part of his
surname from the Danish ''sen'' to the anglicized
"son", A number of reasons may have been at the
root of this name change and we should not discount
the possibility that the disdain and even cruel treat-
ment accorded many "lowly Scandinavians" by some
of the early English born Saints may have been a
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 534

factor. It was not popular in some areas of Zion,
even in Sanpete, to be a Danishman or a Swede.
In fact, a few of the early Danish converts in
Sanpete County, and elsewhere, apostatized from
the church because of the shameful treatment
accorded them by their English ''brethren",
Likely none of these early English converts who
may have prided themselves on their "royal"
descent from England's great ''William the Con-
queror'' knew that this same William, Duke of
Normandy, was a grandson of the early Danish
Viking Chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French) who more
or less seized Normandy from the French king in
911 A.D. Is it not an advantage to know who one
really is?

Albert was scarcely two when his family
moved from Gunnison to North Mayfield, his
parents having joined the ''United Order'' experi-
ment then in progress there. Here he was given
his first lessons at his mother's knee; for she was
deeply interested in education and studied to per-
fect her speaking and reading of English along with
her children, When the "Order'' was dissolved
there the early spring of 1877, the Christensens
moved across Twelve Mile Creek to South May-
field. It was here that Albert entered public
school for the first time, the fall of 1878, a few
months before he turned six.

When he was six and a half his mother went
to Salt Lake City to study medicine. After her
return she was away from home a great deal treat-
ing the sick or delivering babies. The children |
became accustomed to the sight of her brown medi-
cal kit, always packed and standing ready at a
moments notice, and the sound of heavy wagons
rattling up their street day or night and stopping
to pick up their mother, then rattling off again in
the direction they had come.

Following the severe, disastrous winter of
1879/80 the family sold its interests in Mayfield
and moved back to Gunnison where they lived for
a short time in a small adobe in the east part of
town owned by a relative, Lars Myrup. Albert
was then a towheaded youngster of seven and a
half and rather large for his age, His father soon
<span id="page-??"></span>
535 Albert

leased a farm in North Christenburg, owned by
Julius H. Christensen, and here they lived in
summers for the next several years. His father
purchased some property in northwest Gunnison

on which stood a two-roomed adobe dwelling where
the large family lived for a few months each winter
while the older children attended school in the
Relief Society Hall, about a block east of them,
which was also used for church gatherings,

A larger house, of rock, was erected near
the old one and the family used both houses to live
in for atime, Additional rooms were eventually
added to the new house and additional children to
the family, until there were nine living children in
all besides the two little ones who had passed away
soon after their births. Soon the family moved back
to Gunnison altogether and the new rock house be-
came the "ancestral home"! of their descendants.

It was from this home that Albert walked some
several miles to the Sanpitch River, with his
bundle of clothes under his arm, and was baptized
a member of the L. D. S. church, by John Larsen,
and dressed later behind a squawberry bush. This
was 5 Apr. 1882, when he was almost four months
past nine. He was confirmed next day in church,

6 Apr. 1882, by Samuel Lublin.

From the time he was old enough to take
responsibility Albert was given work to do in the
home and on the farm. As he grew in size and
confidence he became eager to get a job for pay.
He soon learned that working away from home for
someone else was not always what it was ''cracked
up to be'. Between ages ten and eleven he hired
out to one Peterson for $3 a month and board,
When he was not much past twelve he worked for
a short time for Bishop A, C, Madsen hauling
manure in a wagon with a span of contrary mules,

But a few days later another job opportunity
came to Albert, Julius H. Christensen, for whom
his older brother Chris was then herding sheep,
hired him to run a farm for him at $12 a month
and ''keep'', With but a few extra clothes, besides
the overalls and shirt he was wearing, he was
taken out to run an approximately 300 acre farm
in South Christenberg on which stood a one-room
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 536

log cabin with a leanto. With only general directions
he was left to live there alone. Most of the time
that summer of 1885 he had no companions except
the horses with which he worked the farm, a mon-
grel dog who seemed to need a master, and a horde
of night-reveling pack rats as big as half grown
cats,

"Notwithstanding that my employer had the
reputation of being a hard man to work for", wrote
Albert of this experience, ''I found him the opposite.
His family, consisting of himself, his wife, five
daughters and one son, was really a model family.
Iwas always treated with the greatest respect by
all of them. While Mr. Christensen himself
claimed to be an atheist, his family was affiliated
with the Presbyterian church in Gunnison. Without
any request on my part my employer, on two
different occasions that summer, told me I was
worth more than I was being paid. The first time
he raised my wages to $15 per month and the second
to $20. This, together with 'keep' was a high wage
for a boy of my age at the time."

Late that fall Albert went home and attended
school for some three months, which was about the
usual school year in those early farm communities.
He was in the "fifth reader'' at the time. Early the
next spring he was again hired by Julius Christensen
and this time he had charge ofa herd of sheep in the
mountains, He was then nearing fifteen. That late
fall he again went home and attended school for
about three months, then returned to the mountains
again in early spring to herd sheep for Mr,
Christensen,

Albert must have been a hard and dependable
worker, even as a youth, for his responsibilities
were being constantly increased, as well as his
wages. He never seemed to have trouble getting
employment, The fall of 1888 Mr. Christensen
told him that if he would continue to work for him
with the sheep he would pay him as high a wage as
any man in his employ except his brother Chris,
who was his foreman, That was $30 a month and
board, Chris was getting $35. So Albert stayed on
for another full year, or until he was approaching
his seventeenth birthday. He was often lonely in
<span id="page-??"></span>
537 Albert

the mountains, Trouble with Indians, cattlemen,
mired and frozen sheep was not uncommon to him,
His memories of a happy home and the occasional
visits of his brother Chris strengthened and sus-
tained him.

His year's service ended, his employer again
came to him and offered to rent him a herd and
assist him in getting started in the sheep business
for himself if he would stay on with the sheep as
his brother Chris was doing, Now Albert had
always cherished the greatest admiration for his
oldest brother and this offer must have been a real
temptation to him; but he had made up his mind to
get an education so he turned down the offer and
went back to Gunnison to school,

Rather early in life Albert had dreamed of
becoming a lawyer, He said, "As a child I was
intrigued with court hearings and attracted to trials
in the Justice of the Peace courts, I believe they
were held in the school house in those days, I
happened there once when the Justice and two men,
whom I knew to be lawyers, were conducting the
preliminary hearing of a case involving grand ~
larceny. The lawyers were Jacob Johnson and
William K. Reid. Johnson was a man who
attracted general attention. He was rather large
and heavy set and wore a long Prince Albert coat
and silk stovepipe hat, and all in all had a most
distinguished appearance. William K. Reid, a
small man with keen gray eyes, was slightly
stooped and his right hand seemed to be withered
and useless, (Both of these gentlemen Albert was
to be rather closely associated with in the law
profession years later. )-

"Jacob Johnson, with his deep voice and
measured sentences, almost scared me, His
sharp, sarcastic retorts, witty Scotch-Irish
insinuations and illustrations I found amazing and
delightful, From that time on I never missed a
Justice trial when there was one in town, school
or no school, As a résult of this, or perhaps
something else beyond my understanding, I
seemed to have the firm conviction that I would
someday be alawyer, Strengthening this intention
was my parents' confidence in me, for it finally
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 538

became known to them that despite all odds I was
going to study law. A close friend told me of my
mother's reaction when she spoke to her about the
many hardships and temptations to be encountered

in attaining and following this profession, My

mother said she had full confidence in me and knew

I would surmount the obstacles and be a good lawyer,."'

The autumn of 1890, when his mother went
back to visit her people in Old Denmark and search
out her genealogy, Albert entered the Gunnison
Seminary. The next fall he went to Provo, Utah
and enrolled in the Brigham Young Academy there.
A Judge Wilson was giving an elementary course
in law and Albert was. attracted to this. Here he
was introduced to some of the writings of the
famous English jurist and legal historian, Sir
William Blackstone, and later bought one of his
books, He also registered for German, mathe-
matics and psychology. The fine educator, Dr,
Karl G. Maeser, was still president of the B. Y. A.
until about midterm that year, or Jan, 1892,
‘Albert recalled Dr. Maeser passing him one morn-
ing bound for his home where he had inadvertantly

left his keys. ''Ven you haf your brains in your
heels", he explained in his inimitable manner,
"you must use your heels!" While there he also

played on the college football team, which was
before the days of heavy padding and helmets when
the game was really rough.

He helped to put himself through college by
working summers and teaching alternate winters,
The school year of 1892/93 he served as Principal
of the District School in the small farming com-
munity of Koosharem, Sevier County. The fall of
1893 he again entered B, Y. A. and continued his
studies in English, German, Latin, mathematics,
speech and pedagogy. Dr. Benjamin Cluff was
president of the Academy then.

The winter of 1894/95 Albert taught fifth
and sixth grades in his hometown of Gunnison,
That summer he worked hauling posts and poles
to fence the 160 acres of land he had purchased
from his father. He had also acquired a city lot
and several head of livestock out of his earnings,
I heard him speak of that pleasant year at home
<span id="page-??"></span>
539 Albert

among his loved ones, He mentioned his father as
being so wise, patient, kind and helpful. He spoke
of his mother with great affection as ''the life and
soul of the home!"' She then had given up her exten-
sive medical practice of some fourteen years and
was taking boarders. She and Albert had many
intimate and inspiring conversations that year,

and one particular one about marriage. He also
mentioned his delicate little foster sister, Ada,
and what joy her sweetness shed in their home,

He spoke of looking forward to visits with her on
his return from school in late afternoons.

During that year he often visited his grand-
father, Christen Christensen, the only one ofhis
grandparents he had ever known. He had such
great respect and fondness for the fine old Danish
gentleman, The two had much in common, includ-
ing their love for fine horses, The older man had
raised a thoroughbred colt from birth, with Albert
in mind, telling him that it would someday be his,
Together they had watched this outstanding animal
grow and develop until she was ready for the reins.
Albert broke her and it was during that year that
he was given this mare for his own; although he
insisted on giving his grandfather a fair price for
it. He bought a smart rubber-tired buggy to go
along with his horse and when he went to Provo to
again attend B. Y. A. he drove up in style. That.
rig was his pride and joy.

President Cluff also took a liking to Albert's
rig and often borrowed it during that winter of
1895/96, professing a desire to purchase it from
him and keeping it to ''try out" for unnecessarily
long periods at atime. This finally provoked
Albert and he said a few harsh words to the presi-
dent. He always felt this was the real reason that
Cluff turned "thumbs down!'' on his being selected
class orator for the graduating ceremony that
Spring, although he was selected by his class,

The president stated as his reason the fact that
Albert hadn't taken teachers training so wasn't
entitled to graduate. This of course was ambiguous,
since Albert had beenapracticalteacher of two years
experience, Albert refused to take out his degree
from B, Y. A. under those conditions, in spite of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 540

the fact that he had the support of his classmates
and more than enough credits. We have heard the
tale about what was lost '', , all for the want ofa
horseshoe nail'', including the rider. In Albert's
case, however, nothing was lost except perhaps a
bit of his pride, for he still had his horse and buggy
and all the excellent knowledge and training accu-
mulated towards his graduation, as well as an
additional amount of wisdom regarding the frailties
of man.

During the school year of 1896/97, he acted
as Principal of the Levan school in Juab County.
In his spare time he indefatigably read Blackstone
and other law books and also studied history, He
had set his mind on attending the law school in Ann
Arbor, Michigan if at all possible, When school
closed he returned to Gunnison and continued to
read and study law all the time hoping that his
chance would come, Money for transportation and
tuition was his main concern, That summer he
greatly missed the ever-ready smile of the coura-
geous little Ada in the home, for she had passed
away the previous winter.

Some other impressionable experiences came
to Albert about that time. He was given the oppor-
tunity to argue his first case before the law. It was
a jury trial and he put up a strenuous legal battle
for the defense, a citizen of Gunnison, Although
they lost the case, his client seemed well pleased
with his services and the leniency of the verdict,
as well as his fee. Albert figured the experience
was well worth the time and effort and so charged
nothing; besides it helped to strengthen his deter-
mination to go ahead with law - sometime - somehow.

One evening he attended the local theater to
witness a performance by a home dramatic club
from Manti, On the handbill advertising the play
was a picture of the leading lady - a Miss Virginia
Snow, Her acting impressed Albert; in fact he
became so interested in Miss Snow during the
course of the evening that he saved her picture
and placed it in one of the law books he was
studying.

The long hoped for opportunity to go to law
<span id="page-??"></span>
541 Albert

school came rather unexpectedly soon after, About
dusk, 11 Aug. 1897, as Albert approached home,
he was met by Henry A. Kerns, a local sheepman,
and offered the job of taking a train load of sheep
back to Kansas City. He accepted immediately,
even though he was to leave by early morning less
than two days later. He realized that this was the
opportunity he had been waiting for. He said, 'My
heart was beating rapidly as l arrived home, I
told father and mother of my decision and received
their blessing.

"The next morning at daybreak J was on my
way to the Manti City Savings Bank with my horse
and rubber-tired buggy. I hoped that by borrowing
enough money to pay my tuition for the first year 1
could somehow make my way through law school.
Iwas kindly granted a loan of $200, although I
already owed the bank $500 on my previous school-
ing. Ilarrived home after dark, Mother had my
underwear, sox, extra clothes and other personal
effects already packed in a telescope case, She
pressed my only good suit which I had worn that
day and packed that. At about 3:30 next morning
we left for Gunnison depot, No one except father
and mother was on hand to bid me 'Godspeed', yet
with their faith in me I was sure I would not fail."

Yes, Laurs and Else Christensen, his loyal
and caring parents, stood encouraging and cheering
from the sidelines every worthy ambition and
accomplishment their children undertook, It was
a matter of great love, but then again perhaps a
little matter of pride also, Something outstanding
could come out of Little Denmark!

So Albert went on his way east, in company
with several carloads of lambs bound for the Kan-
sas City market. He had only been out of the
State of Utah once before and then no farther than
Denver. Along with him also were his telescope
case and a few law books, into one of which had
been tucked a picture of Miss Virginia Snow. He
was well prepared, however, for his schooling at
the University in Ann Arbor, and in two years
completed the regular three year law course and
secured his coveted 'sheepskin'', This was not
done without sacrifice, long hours of grilling study,

working after school, and without selling most of
what he had in Gunnison, including the treasured
horse and buggy, nor without deeply appreciated
financial help from his wonderful brother Chris "I,"

Back in Utah the summer of 1899, Albert
"hung up his shingle'' in Manti. A dream of long
standing was about to come true. And yet another
dream was in the making, for soon he was intro-
duced to Miss Virginia Snow, or ''Jennie''as her
friends all knew her, The two began dating and a
wonderful courtship followed, Some proud moments
came for Albert when he escourted ''Miss Snow'' to
his hometown of Gunnison and she presented a
dramatic, patriotic reading at the annual community
Fourth of July celebration of 1900. She was so
dainty, vivacious and talented,

Albert took Jennie to the Manti Temple, 26
Sept. 1900, and made her his own "leading lady",
Sometime in October they moved into their own
two-story brick home at 155 North 2nd West, which
Albert had been able to completely pay for and
furnish, due to his having been selected to take
care of the legal work pertaining to the settlement
of some one hundred claims brought on by the
tragic Scofield coal mine disaster,

Those were mostly bright years as Albert
and Jennie walked together through the corridors
of an exceedingly happy marriage; as they brought
forth their five beloved children; and as he became
a highly respected lawyer, County Attorney, and
finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court,
comprising Sanpete, Carbon, Emery, Grand and
San Juan counties, I recall the salary was $4, 000
a year - quite a sum for those days.

Those were the days when lawyers went about
their precincts in buggies, buckboards, or on
horseback with law books tied to their saddles,
During his judgeship Albert traveled by horse-
drawn stage, train, and the automobile. Price,
the County Seat of Carbon, was then at the zenith
of its riproaring history and his calendar was
filled with many sensational criminal trials, along
with the important civil ones,

As Albert prospered he bought sheep and land.

He went into the sheep business with his brother
Arthur, who cared for the sheep while he furnished
the capital. They lambed their sheep on Cedar
Mountain east of Salina, After lambing, about
July Ist, they would move into Twelve Mile Can-
yon for the summer months and then winter on the
west desert, Albert's brother Louis helped Arthur
take care of the sheep onthe desert during some of
those winters,

Albert joined his brother-in-law, George
Black, in a small land investment in Garfield
County. He bought property from the Warren
Stone Snow estate and built the first garage busi-
ness in Manti. One of his major purchases was
about 350 acres of land on either side of the Sevier
River west of Gunnison which he called his 'Gunni-
son Ranch'! and into which he put a great deal of
effort and money. Bert Gledhill says he was
working for Albert on the Gunnison Ranch when he
had the two huge barns built there and helped haul
the lumber to build them, He was also working
there when one of these big barns blew down during
a turbulent windstorm and had to be rebuilt,

On 29 Apr. 1908, Albert made arrangements
to buy 160 acres of land some eighteen miles
north of Gunnison in an area known as Flat Canyon,
and this he called his 'Flat Canyon Ranch", People
came from long distances to buy the "blue ribbon
peaches'' raised by some in Flat Canyon, Large,
white-rind watermelon from there received first
prize at both County and State fairs one year.
Albert hoped to make this ranch into a first rate
fruit farm and planted a large number of peach .
trees, The summers were very hot there and the
winters extremely cold, which created some
problems,

In Oct, 1910, exactly ten years after Albert
and Jennie had settled in their first home, Albert
moved his family into a lovely new home a half
block south from the old. It was not quite finished
at the time but by the next spring it was ready to
show to their friends, Fri., Mar, 31, 1911, the
Manti Messenger carried this article:

"Dedication of Home and Housewarming
Over Hundred People Entertained at
Christenson Home this week,

"Judge and Mrs, A. H, Christenson enter-
tained royally Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
the first a dedication and the second a housewarm-
ing of their new palatial residence on Depot Street.
Wednesday was the dedication and invitations were
confined to relatives and neighbors, about 35 being
present, The dedicatory prayer was offered by
J. H. Carpenter and short talks were given by
Bishop Peterson and Ezra Shoemaker. Music was
furnished by Alida Snow and Prof, Fred J, Fjelsted.
The balance of the evening consisted of games and
refreshments,

"Thursday night invitations were issued to
70, a crowd of younger people made up mostly from
the clubs. The High School orchestra furnished the
music during the early evening and, in addition to
a short program, the principal entertainment was
cards, Refreshments were served also.

'The Christenson home is an enviable poss-
ession and a credit to any city, built of white bricks
and with every line in quality and style of finish
noting stability, On the first floor are the reception
hall and living room thrown into one, a large and a
small dining room, kitchen and pantry. On the
second floor are a library, three bedrooms, sun
room and bath room, The reception hall, living
room and large dining room are furnished with
solid oak and the balance of the house with fir.

The entire woodwork is in natural wood stain - no
paint being used. The front door is bevel plate
glass, copper joined. The doors to the china
closet in the large dining room are of the same
material. The living room ceiling is of oak beam
finish and the furniture of the craftsman finish, A
modern basement with furnace, home cellar,
laundry, amd coal bins, complete a thoroughly
up-to-date building. ''

Accompanying the home were some lovely
old shade trees - a spreading walnut - weeping
willow - boxelder - and three heavy bearing apricot
trees, together with a large garden plot, corral,

barn, buggy shed and small horse-run, In the
corral were always a milch cow or two, some
chickens, perhaps a few lambs, and father's
thoroughbred horses often lifting their noble heads
high over the big corral gates,

Against the backdrop of Albert and Jennie's
two homes and their numerous activities was staged
the memorable drama ofthe family life that we
their children knew and cherish, The scenes invite
us even now, It was at our first home that I sought
father's sheltering arms in fright at the sight of
my first bewhiskered, bell jangling ''ho-ho-hoing"
Santa Claus, while my younger sister, Elaine,
stood up bravely and gave her order -- ''I want
dah and dahbug"'. It was here we took our first
"space flights'' holding tight to the long rope swing
secured high up in our poplar trees and operated -
by father's strong arms, It was here we were .
roused from our beds at midnight and lifted high —
in those same strong arms to the attic window to
view Halley's Comet, a fiery ball in the sky with
a tail of stardust trailing behind, It was father
who allayed our fears that with the coming of this
comet the world would end, as people were saying.

It was with father as guide that we rode in
saddlebags through the dense forests to the sheep
camp and trembled at the bear stories told by the
herder, Tillby, as we went along. It was later,
with father's consent, that we romped over the
hills of giant wool sacks at the shearing corral in
Christenburg. It was with him we first picnicked
at 'Devil's Ribs" and roamed Temple Hill in
search of 'Indian Eyeballs". It was he who baited
our hooks as we fished for sunfish at Funk's Lake,
or for carp at Nine Mile Reservoir at sundown.

Father drove the hayrack in which we crossed
the river wheel-deep at Gunnison Ranch to gather
redberries and with him we watched the long legged
killdeers wading there and listened to their shrill
bird cries at eventide, It was with him holding
the lines that we rode in the buggy with "Stride On"
in the harness on so many happy little trips to see
our Danish grandparents, or through the west
fields in search of sagebrush for mother to brew
for hair rinsings, or merely to discover the first
<span id="page-??"></span>

wild rose of spring for her,

Father cautioned us to watch out for rattle-
snakes at Flat Canyon as we picked peaches,
fished salamanders from the water cistern, or
wandered up the canyon of odd shaped rocks nearby,
whose formation resembled giant cooking pots all
turned topsy-turvy, so aptly called ''Hell's Kitchen",
With father we took our annual birthday trips by
train or stage to Richfield, Price and other places
he held court. He drove when we took our first car
rides, I sitting in the bottom of the back seat of our
new Buick eating salty soda crackers to keep from
getting "car sick",

It was at the new home that we sat with him
and mother in the shelter of the broad front porch
and watched battles of the elements in the heavens
as 'Thor swung his great hammer ina rumble of
thunder'' or "Odin flashed through the sky in his
chariot of fire’. There was nothing to fear when
father was near. Here we sat in the living room
with the firelight from the fireplace reflected in
the polished floors and colonnades, while mother
read to us and father peeled apples or cracked nuts
for our enjoyment. It was here we waited breath-
lessly at the bend of the staircase for the grate-fire
to be prodded into blazing, the wax candles to be
lighted on the Christmas tree, and for that most
thrill tingling sound of all - father's ''Well, well,
well, it looks as if Santa Claus has been here after
all!" As if there was ever any doubt of it at our
house, *

It was at the San Francisco World Exhibition
the summer of 1915 that mother, Elaine and I were
shepherded around so expertly by father through
the maze of beautiful buildings, exhibits, museums,
courts, parks and statuary, with the ''Tower of
Jewels'' looking down over all and pigeons, pigeons
everywhere, which we often fed. There were so
many things for our wondering eyes to "drink in" -
people from all over the world in their native
costumes - ex-U. S, president William Howard
Taft with silk topped hat, tails and a fancy cane
among them, With father we stood hand in hand
on the broad steps of the ''Court of the Four Winds'!
and listened in rapture to the chains of silver sound
<span id="page-??"></span>
547 Albert

rising up from the immense amphitheater below,

as the great John Phillip Susa's band gave a stirring
concert. We heard Utah's own Emma Lucy Gates
sing the Star Spangled Banner on ''Utah Day" (July
24) at the Fair, It was on this trip we caught our
first sight of the Pacific Ocean and witnessed our
first and only traditional bull fight in Tijuana,
Mexico.

A happy childhood is like a radiant jewel
sparkling on the more somber chain of life - its
beauty never dims, This was one of our priceless
legacies. During those years, father was our hero,
our protector, our Knight in shining armor. We
never found cause to fear him nor to doubt him,
for he truly loved us, Our home was a sanctuary
of joy and peace, where laughter, story telling and
music played a big part.

Father and mother had some choice friends
in Manti during those years - Hattie and Chris
Axelson, May and Haze Clark, Eloise and E. D.
Sorenson, Delphia and Quince Crawford, Millie
and Halburt Kerr, Alice and Dilworth Wooley,
Kate and Warren Snow - the L. R. Andersons,

J. H, Hornungs, Ray P. Dyrengs, E, T. Reids,
Ellis E, Johnsons, Frank Alders ~- I'm sure I have
missed some. Most of the ladies belonged to the
Manti Literary Club and the men to the Commer-
cial Club. Their most intimate friends joined
them in a '500 Club’. They had wonderful times
together,

But there are varieties to living and happiness
does not always endure, In the early evening of
Monday, 27 July 1916, in the Covey Apartments
in Salt Lake City, five people surrounded the bed-
side of Jennie Christensen - her life had just
ebbed away. Her aging father, Joseph Snow, stood
on the right, with stooped shoulders and eyes cast
down in grief. Her sister, Retta Neff, knelt beside
him shaken with sobbing. Father stood on the left,
bending close to the pillow where mother lay. I
knew his heart was breaking but he did not weep -
outwardly. I stood near him and held her limp,
outstretched hand in both of mine; somehow my
fear of death vanished at that moment. Then father
rose and put one arm around me - ''We must go on
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 548

together without your mother", he said gently -
"We must be brave.'! Childhood took leave of me
then and never returned, Father was never quite
his old self again after that either,

Albert continued to serve as District Judge
until his term ran out in 1917, but declined to stand
for renomination although both parties indicated a
desire to place him on their tickets, His duties as
Judge necessitated long absences from home and
he felt he needed to be near his five motherless
children, So he brought his energies back to the
private practice of law, the running of sheep, the
operation of his two ranches plus some semi-
private business projects.

After Jennie's death his sister Vena came
into the home for a time to assist him. Then
Jennie's sister, Retta Neff, came to help and
brought her children while her husband was away
studying for his doctorate. Occasional hired girls
followed but proved to be poor substitutes for a
mother, Sometimes of necessity the children were
left to carry on alone - but not often, After nearly
four years of this, Albert found a wonderful help-
mate in Miss Myrtle Farnsworth, the Domestic
Science teacher in the local High School and a
younger sister of Ida, lovely wife of Edgar T.
Reid, who lived neighbors across the road.

Albert and Myrtle were married in the St,
George Temple, 23 June 1920. She was almost
thirty-five and he was forty-seven and a half. His
children lovingly called her Aunt Myrtle from then
on and she had an outstanding influence for good on
their lives from the beginning, Albert was then
tied up in a huge land investment known as the
"Starr Ranch'', Myrtle understood about it before
their marriage, since Albert had told her that if
the venture succeeded, all would be wonderful, but
that if it failed he would be literally ''wiped out",
Myrtle was willing to take the chance,

Albert's brother, Andrew, had interested him
in this venture, a large ranch in Juab County north
of Nephi, the possibilities of which, to Andrew at
least, seemed enormous, Though Albert was not
as enthusiastic as the less conservative Andrew,
<span id="page-??"></span>
549 Albert

yet he had let himself become involved when an
organization was set up among three major stock-
holders: Andrew (A. B.), his brother-in-law, Otis
L, Ercanbrack, and Albert (A. H.), with a view to
purchasing livestock and real estate on a large
scale from the Starr Land and Development Com-
pany.

With A. B. as president of the new company
and A, H. as secretary, a special meeting of stock-
holders had been held 24 Nov. 1919 in Nephi, where
the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:--
"Resolved to buy said property from the Starr Land
and Development Company, the cost to be paid as
follows: Total price $130, 000 with $35, 000 down
in cash, the assumption of a $20, 000 mortgage to
the State of Utah then carried on the property, the
balance of $75, 000 to be assured by three promis-
sory notes, one for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1920,
another for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1921, another
for $55, 000 due ten years from date of purchase,
with 6% interest overall - and in addition, the crops
raised and harvested upon said land during the year
1920 to be mortgaged as future security for the note
due in 1920, and the 1921 crops mortgaged to secure
the note due in December of that year." So the deal
had been made and became valid and binding upon
all concerned,

This proved to be the most disastrous step
Albert ever took. Being at the height of the post-
war boom of World War I, these stockholders were
not spared when the post-war depression followed
shortly. Albert was forced to mortgage all he
owned to try and keep things going, as well as to
borrow all additional he could, Lastly, he was
forced to turn over his lovely home and most all
else he had to his creditors, and besides was left
under a staggering Ioad of debt which at the time
must have loomed as impossible for him to sur-
mount, .

In August of 1925 Albert and his family
loaded up their remaining belongings and moved
to Provo, Utah. Phillip, almost fourteen at the
time, tells of this move:-- ''Then came the move
from Manti to Provo. It was made with two hay-
racks, Uncle Arthur Christensen driving one and
<span id="page-??"></span>

my brothers Sherman and Hale the other, I rode
with them as far as Salt Creek Canyon and then got
tired of the whole transaction, for we burned out a
boxing and had to camp for a day or two until we
could get a replacement, Father came along in the
old car and took me into Provo where he had taken
Aunt Myrtle and the rest, He had arranged to rent
a house in northeast Provo but it wasn't ready when
we got there so we stayed for a few weeks with some
of Aunt Myrtle's relatives; first the Ashworths and
then the Abner Tanners until our house was ready.
They were wonderful to us.

"We lived about nine months in Provo and
then father bought an old home on an eight acre
farm from M, B. Cutler, who had two wives, each
deaf and dumb and living in separate homes, When
we first looked at this old home, the Mrs, Cutler
who lived there lovingly patted the furnace, about
the only modern thing in the place. Aunt Myrtle
soon made it look and feel like home however, and
later an inside bathroom was installed and other
improvements made, Here we had rows and rows
of raspberries and strawberries, cats and cows,
and an old horse, Molly, who pulled the cultivator
for us through the rows of berries, Father and I
planted fruit trees, apple, peach and cherry,
together with a large garden." .

It was no small task for Albert to re-
establish himself, start a new law practice with
few contacts and very little backing and to build a
career, almost as from the beginning, Though past
middle age and heavily weighted down by debt, he
found sufficient reason to go on fighting. Perhaps
it was his Viking blood that urged him. Even
though his debts ran into many times ten thousand
and more, he resolved to pay back every dollar.

There was seemingly no end to the sorrow
and additional expense he was called upon to endure
those next few fateful years. On July 23, 1926 his
brother Joseph passed away. Sept. 4, 1927 his
sister Emma died, The next spring there was
much illness among his loved ones, His elderly
father was suffering untold misery from diabetic
ulcers; his father-in-law was in bad shape with
cancer and his son Hale was in constant distress
<span id="page-??"></span>
551 Albert

with a then undetermined illness, Albert divided
his limited time among them, doing whatever he
could for each, His father-in-law passed away

3 Aug. 1928 in Salt Lake City. Albert was on hand
when the end came and again at Manti when last
rites were conducted for the fine old gentleman,
Joseph S, Snow. Nov. 10, 1928 he was called
from Hale's sickbed to the deathbed of his own
father, L. M, C. Christensen, who was laid to
rest a few days later in the Manti cemetery and
whose suffering had been long and heart-rending.

Hale had been operated on that mid-July but
this failed to disclose the trouble or cure it. How-
ever a second operation near mid-October had
revealed his condition to be grave. After that he
never left the L. D, S, Hospital in Salt Lake City
until his death of internal cancer, 9 Mar. 1929,
Albert wrote of this:-- 'This morning at 5:40 a.m,
our dearest Hale passed away - that same wonder-
ful boy that he has shown himself to be throughout
this terrible but unequal struggle. While my heart
is grieved beyond words, I thank God that his awful
ordeal is over, His has been an example that should
help us all to carry on properly under all conditions,
His memory to me will be a staff for whatever may
befall us. I am proud to be the father of sucha boy,"

A little past five months after Hale's death a
baby girl, their third and last child, was born to
Albert and Myrtle. They called her Kathryn and
she brought a ray of bright sunshine from without
the gloom, But the sorrows went on. Before
Kathryn was a week old, Myrtle's beloved sister,
Ida Reid, was crushed to death in a car accident.
Myrtle held up bravely but there were still more
partings for her to endure, A bolt out of the blue.
came with word of her father's passing, the last
of November 1931, Myrtle's mother came from
Beaver to live with them then, but exactly one _
month after her husband's death, the sweet little
old lady was killed by a fall at the home in Orem,

In between these last two deaths, or 17 Dec,
1931, came word of the unexpected passing of
Albert's brother, Andrew, all alone in a strange
hotel in St. George, Utah. The grim reaper made
yet another call on Albert's loved ones when less —
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 552

than a year later, 4 Dec, 1932, his brother Arthur
passed away after surgery. Some seem to be
tested more than others at times and Albert was
one of these, His cup of sorrow must have been
near to running over during those difficult years,

By then the country was in the midst of the
great depression. Banks were closed, jobs were
at a premium and many people were hungry.
Though Albert had all the legal business he could
handle, and more, collections were hard to make
since most of his clients had little available money,
Nor was his health the best, for the strain and
pressures of recent years had begun to take their
toll. Above all was the fact that he was still
heavily burdened by debt. He had worked almost
night and day, and his family had worked and saved
and gone without along with him, with but one end
in mind - that of freeing him from debt, Friends
had advised him to take out bankruptcy - many were
doing it. He flatly refused although at times
pressured almost beyond endurance by some of his
creditors, He was in dead earnest about paying off
all of his obligations with interest, as soon as time
and circumstance would permit.

During the long, hard pull, his home, his
beloved family, his small fruit farm, together with
his great faith in a Divine Power, were his strength
and his refuge. Indeed he couldn't have continued
the struggle without these, He couldn't have gotten
along without Myrtle, who managed his household
so expertly and with such courage and kindliness.,
The way she stood by him, giving hope and encour-
agement, will be forever to her credit. He couldn't
have managed without the love and cooperation of
his children and the pride and satisfaction he had
in their accomplishments, He looked forward to
family associations - birthday parties - picnics -
hunting and fishing trips - reunions - just daily little
visits - but especially the glorious Christmas Eve
family home evenings in which everyone took a
special part and which were never neglected as
long as he lived.

His daughter Kathryn writes of his later
years:-- ''Dad was fifty-six when Iwas born, By
the time I was a teenager he was sixty-nine and
<span id="page-??"></span>
553 Albert

when I reached college age he was seventy-four.

We worked out a fine relationship. I always thought
of him as loving and kind, but the characteristics

I remember most were his great dignity, scrupu-
lous honesty, and his pride in us children, [
remember him saying on occasions when his family
was all gathered around him that he could not con-
ceive of Heaven being much more wonderful than
this,

"T remember serious talks with Dad and I
recall the loving way he'd take my hand and would
rub my thumb and knuckles in a circular movement
of his large thumb, He placed constant emphasis
upon us being more than just "scrub! or common
run-of-the-mill. Somehow he managed to make us
children feel that we had an obligation, because of
our heritage, to be contributing, worthwhile mem-
bers of society. He would not compromise on the
kind of school grades he expected. I usually left
a list of my grades on the mantlepiece where he
put his car keys and under which he always care-
fully placed his high topped shoes at end of day.

If ever there was anything besides an '"'A''on that
list, no matter how many ''A's" there were, he
would say, 'Well, let's see if we can do a little
better next time, '

"Most of my life I felt that it was necessary >
to be very careful financially, although I know that
by the time I began to grow up things were easier
than earlier, There always seemed enough money
for music lessons and schooling however. All Dad.
asked in return was that we take advantage of these
opportunities. He wanted us to develop.our talents
to the fullest. Countless times I have been grateful
for the fine education he was willing to provide for
me, Je,

"IT can still remember the look of joy on my |
parents' faces when Dad came home from the office
sometime during the last of World War II to tell us
he was finally out of debt, His honesty, integrity,
courage and determination have been a great
inspiration to me and helped me to understand that
there is little in life that cannot be faced success-
fully in the long run, if these characteristics have
been developed within. As the giver of gifts of life
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 554

that were most meaningful and precious our father
was most generous and gracious.

"IT remember Dad as a man of the soil. From
early spring to late fall he and mother would rise
around 5:00 a.m. He would work in the garden until
7:00, have his breakfast, and then prepare to leave
for the office by 8:00. He would often spend around
two hours in the garden again after his full day at
the office. His loving care showed in his gardens
and orchards. They were beautiful to behold, and
kept a never failing supply of fresh vegetables and
fruits on our table all summer and fall, with plenty
for mother to bottle for use during the rest of the
year, His ability with the irrigation water seemed
magical; mother said it seemed like water would
run uphill for Dad. Helping him plant corn,
potatoes and beans are rather special memories to
me and family fruit-harvesting-parties were the
‘greatest’,

"Some of the more humorous aspects of life
with Dad always cause a chuckle within my heart.
Dad did enjoy driving nice cars! The first car I
remember was a green 1936 Plymouth which pulled
our housetrailer all over the United States for our
vacation in that year, The next was a blue Chrysler
Highlander with red plaid and leather seat covers,
This was the car I learned to drive and used so
much. When it came to getting a new car in 1947,
Dad said in mock seriousness that he was going to
get a Ford. When the time came for the debut, he
chose a Sunday morning. He took mother and me
to Sunday School in the old car and then went to
get the new. When Sunday School let out, there
was Dad out in front of Lincoln High School, where
our ward held church then, in a brand new 1947
Lincoln with push button doors and windows,
Picture if you can all the men and boys of the ward
crowded around that gorgeous car! Finally, as
mother and I were able to get through the crowd
and into the car, Dad found he couldn't get it
started. So many people had tried the battery-
powered windows that the battery had gone dead.

A substantial amount of glory vanished amid calls
of 'Why don't you get a horse?!

"It was in the Lincoln that Dad, mother, a
<span id="page-??"></span>
555 Albert

granddaughter, Colleen Keeler, and I drove back
to attend the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia the summer of 1948. Dad was an
official delegate from Utah to that convention which
nominated Thomas E, Dewey for the U. S. Presi-
dency. Dad was a lifelong Republican and it was
quite a blow when he and Dewey awoke to find that
Harry Truman had won the election, There were
so many other Republican defeats during those
years that election day, until Eisenhower's victory,
was always followed by a time of gloom at our
house, To me, Dad was 'Mr, Republican of Utah"
and I feel that our nation would be better off if
there were more as sincerely and vitally interested
in politics as he,"'

The proud Lincoln car came to a rather
unceremonious end. The Provo Herald of Friday
June 4, 1954, carried the story:-- 'Judge and Mrs,
A. H. Christenson, Orem, and two grandchildren
narrowly escaped death late Thursday when their
car overturned in a canal, The car rolled over
two and a half times and landed upside down in
Carterville canal, Mr. Christenson, 81, was
pinned against the floor of the overturned car.

"Mrs. Christenson, seeing the outstretched
hands of one granddaughter, Kay Webster, as she
clung to the front car seat, hauled her through the
water filled top of the car, which rested on the
bottom of the canal, and up to air and light. She
pushed the button, rolling down the car windows,
and helped the little girl out onto the canal bank.
Still a prisoner herself, she helped the second
little granddaughter, Sue Webster, to’duck under
the water and up out of the window. However, it
was impossible for the two older persons to get
out of the half submerged car without aid, so she
urged the drenched children, shivering on the bank,
to call for help. An unidentified motorist stopped.
One boy in the car assisted Judge and Mrs,
Christenson.in freeing themselves and the other
drove off to get help.

"The grandchildren, daughters of Reed J.
and Norma C. Webster of Salt Lake City, had just’
arrived for a vacation with their grandparents and
the four were on their way to Provo Canyon for

supper. Thick branches helped to cushion the fall
of the sedan as it sank into the stream,"'!

A lovely new 1954 Buick replaced the Lincoln
in Albert's garage. This was his last car. His
very first car had also been a Buick for, if
memory holds true, he owned one of the first if
not the first Buick in Manti.. Though he was with-
out a car off and on during the years when things
were so difficult, most of the cars he had were of
the best. Fine cars were some of the very few
personal extravagances Albert ever allowed
himself.

Kathryn adds:-- ''Dad had been an excellent
and safe driver. Driving and feeling independent
were of course very important - so important to
him that perhaps he drove too long. I recall how
he ''revved up''the motor there on the south side
of the house in Orem, and then the inevitable
honking and screeching of brakes as he entered
upon Highway 91 with considerable determination,
One of the frustrations of his last years was when
the authorities would no longer renew his drivers
license. The boys came for him lots towards the
end of his life and the Buick remained in the service
shop from time to time." .

One by one each of his three living sons
joined his law firm and began to handle more and
more of the load, leaving Albert added time for
recreation, He spent more time digging around
in his small fruit farm, played a little golf and
chess, and evidenced a special weakness for ''Five
Hundred.'' This latter he often indulged when his
children and their companions dropped in of an
evening. Many lively contests of skill were held
with the family gathered around the dining room
table, and with Aunt Myrtle usually ending up
bringing in a plateful of her famous ''caramels"
to treat both winners and losers,

Albert loved to be out in the mountains, He
went deer hunting almost every fall with his boys
and others, during which time he got "nary a deer,"
Most folks said it was because he hadn't the heart
to shoot the poor things, but his son Phillip said
this just wasn't so - his father was just a poor shot,

But all this was before that ''special hunt" of which
Phillip tells;-- "Father was nearing eighty when

he anda son-in-law, Dan Keeler, and myself went
on a deer hunt southeast of Strawberry. We arrived
on Willow Creek Ridge shortly after daylight and
parked our car, I shot my buck within minutes.
Dan walked out along the ridge and down into a
little draw covered with brush, tossing small rocks
and twigs on either side as he went. Suddenly
antlers appeared in the brush ahead of him - one
quick shot felled the two pointer. Coming back up
onto the ridge Dan met father, 'Do you want to get
a deer'he said, 'Sure' said father. Dan instructed
him to go down into another little draw nearby and
gently throw rocks and twigs, as he had done,
Father disappeared into the draw as I joined Dan
on top the ridge. We were standing there talking
of our successes when - 'Bang! Bang!' came from
the brush below - then all was still, I shouted,
"Have any luck?! In a minute an excited answer
came back; 'I sure did and he's a WHOPPER!!

We three mighty hunters returned to Orem with
our three bucks and father's four pointer topped
the kill, It was his first and last, This wasa
great day for father,"

There were many "great days" for Albert in
his later years, They were great days for him
when he saw his children graduate from college;
when he saw his daughters taking part as "leading
ladies" in operas, oratorios and dramas; when he
saw his grandsons serving foreign missions for
the Church. June 26, 1954 was a great day for
Albert for he saw his oldest son, after having
been nominated by President Eisenhower and
confirmed by the United States Senate, sworn in
to fill one of the highest judicial offices a Utahn
could hold, that of Federal Judge of Utah. It was
a great day for Albert when he himself, together
with Myrtle, was able to return to the beautiful
St. George Temple, this time to workfor the
salvation of the dead,

Sherman writes:-- 'Perhaps one of the
richest parts of father's life was as he and Aunt
Myrtle established a new home in Orem, as he
became one of the leading trial attorneys in the
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 558

State and its recognized authority on irrigation law,
and in this new setting a venerable citizen,
honored, respected and revered,'!

Sometimes when I went to father with my
problems he would listen carefully and then,
instead of giving any particular solutions, would
merely counter with the question, ''Are youa
thoroughbred or a mongrel?" Ithen knew what I
must do, though the doing be hard. He expected
much of his children but he demanded far more of
himself. He had little patience for mediocrity in
those who could do better but for the weak his
sympathy was endless.

Father was a tall man; tall in character as
well as stature. He was a man of self-restraint
and great dignity. Yet his dignity was tempered
with a kindness and humility that would stoop
unseen to place a silver dollar in the hand of a
wistful child. During most of his mature years
he was on the ''giving end" of life. Not half his
charities have ever been told, To me he was a
thoroughbred in every sense of the word.

It must have been another great day for
Albert 'H' Christensen when, Mar, 13, 1957,
his spirit took flight. So many must have been
waiting ''over-there' to greet him - his beloved
wife Jennie - his dear son Hale - his cherished
parents - his brothers and sisters, together with
the kind Chris ''I''cf whom he had dreamed so
vividly not long before. Surely his grandsire
Christen Christensen must have been on hand,
along with others of his worthy ancestors, Think
you some of the more ancient of these may have
been among the welcomers - those who once rowed
or stood commanding at the helm of high-masted
Viking ships with carved wooden dragonheads
pointing the way?

Kathryn writes:-- "I was married and living
inthe east when father died, three months to the
day following his eighty-fourth birthday. He has
remained in my memory as the vigorous, spirited
man that he was the last time I saw him in life. I
arrived home just in time for his funeral and to see
him, as if peacefully sleeping, as I had seen him

"All his later life father dreamed of going
to Denmark, In fact he at one time even began
making serious preparations for sucha trip, He
had instilled in us children a pride in our Danish
heritage. It may be that I was the first of his
descendants to see that beautiful country in his
stead (1959), How proud he would have been to
see that Lovely Land. How proud I was when I
saw it. And how proud Iam of him,"

Ellen Virginia or ''Jennie'! Snow Christensen,
first wife of Albert "H" was born 28 Jan, 1878 in
Manti, Sanpete, Utah. She was the fourth child
and second daughter of nine children born to Joseph
Smith Snow and Lucy Ellen Van Buren, early Mor-
mon Pioneers of English and Dutch descent, ©

A history of her life is included in the volume,
"Cheney Garrett Van Buren and His Family", pub-
lished by this writer in 1962. Others have written
about Jennie S, Christensen and all are agreed that
she was an unusual and outstanding individual.
Albert, writing of his first meeting with her,
states:-- ''There seemed no doubt in my mind
from that first evening but that she would fit
completely into my hopes and life. She had taught
school, attended the University of Utah, was very
intelligent and possessed a grace that greatly
appealed to me. Our visits became regular and
increasingly agreeable to both of us and it was not
long before we became mutually convinced that life
together was promising and inevitable, "'

Elaine describes her thus:-- ''She was small
of stature, but she walked like a queen; her eyes
were large, blue and misty, but searching and
appreciative; her hair was dark and rich, curling
the way nature wanted it to; her mouth was sweet
and provocative, but spoke wisdom and truth; her
hands were small and square, but tender and
creative."!

Mr. Prestwich, who was stage manager at
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 560

the Moroni Theatre, commented that Jennie Snow
had the most beautiful speaking voice he had ever
heard and could have been the top actress of her
day had she not preferred marriage to a career.

Sometimes, when sleep eludes me, I fancy
I see mother Jennie as she lived and breathed
among us. 'Tis strange what childhood impressions
linger. I seem to feel her many moods and to be
swept along in the circle of her activities. The
pictures I see are quite vivid. I never see her
angry, but I see her fearful - fearful when our
horse runs away, tipping the buggy over and
throwing the four of us into the mud, just before
her third baby is expected, and little Elaine, filled
with her own wee worry, cries and points to her
muddy shoes, demanding, ''Take doz off!" I see
mother fearful of childbirth, for she is small and
her babies are large and there is little modern
medical knowledge to assist her - her own mother
died in childbirth. I see her fearful when little
Sherman, who is what they call a hemophiliac, gets
the nosebleed; fearful when father, exhausted from
a hard day at the herd or ranch, goes to sleep in
the bathtub and shakes the place with his snoring
while she, sure he will drown himself, pounds
frantically on the bathroom door and tries to pick
the lock, as we children all take up the pounding
and shout to try and wake him,

I see mother happy and busy at sewing with
us children taking turns threading the machine for
her. I see her stencilling borders of acorns, tulips
and other motifs on scrim for bedroom curtains
for the ''rose-room" with its solid mahogany furni-
ture, the ''blue room!' with its birdseye maple, and
the ''buff room!''. I see her deep-frying timble shells
and chicken croquettes for parties and openhouses
and making dainty little nutbread and boston-brown
bread sandwiches and letting Elaine and I help trim
off the crusts,

As we come downstairs on cold winter morn-
ings, I see her benevolent as she spreads steaming
hot, nourishing breakfasts on the small kitchen
table for some of the local less-fortunates, In
summers I see her giving generous "hand outs''to
roving tramps, gypsies and Indians. Though they
<span id="page-??"></span>
561 Albert

are only roomers, she sends trays bearing tasty
breakfasts up to the blue-room for two out-of-town
lady school teachers with whom we are sharing our
new home one winter - because they can find no
other place to stay.

I see mother sitting patiently in a chair near
the Baldwin piano, counting out the time, over and
over again, as I practice for my piano lesson,
"Sing the little verse that goes with this piece, "'
she says; 'I would like Professor Woodward to
see how well you can play and sing together.'' So
I practice and she sings along with me in her rich
contralto, Sing robin from your woodland tree;
Sing robin, sing a song for me; I love your pretty
melody; sing little robin, sing. 't She kisses me
as Ileave for my lesson. 'Play and sing your
best'', she says, At the studio Mr, Woodward is
entertaining his sweetheart and I feel hesitant about
Singing. Yet I seat myself at the piano and begin
to play my piece and sing, as mother has told me.
"Just play the piece and skip the singing, '' says
my teacher rather sharply. I go home to dear
mother, crying and indignant because it seems he
has insulted her. ''Never mind, '' she says; ''some-
day we'll show Professor Woodward just how lovely
you can sing.'"'!

I see mother patient with girls she has hired -
skinny little Miss Lazenby who eats up all the left-
overs saying, ''Eat 'em to save 'em,'' and Venice,
who gets sick so much that mother is forever hav-
ing to wait on her instead of the other way around.
Good hired girls are so hard to find yet so much
needed to help with our big new house.

I see her without a hired girl and with father
away, weary at the close of day yet bravely trying
to wrestle all four of us children at once as she
gives us our Saturday night baths in the twin sani-
tary tubs in the basement; Hale and Sherman in one
tub, Elaine and lin the other, One or the other of
us keeps getting turned head over heels in those
deep, slick tubs and comes up from the water
gasping and screaming. I see her giving us our
supper later in the kitchen and making our favorite
"Lumpy Dick'' as a last resort, and serving it hot
with extra sugar.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 562

I see her basking in the joy she finds in our
lovely home - in the big dining room with brown
embossed leatherette fabric on the wainscotings,
papered scenes of forests in colors of green, brown
and gold on the walls above and "blue willow'' china
plates on the plate rails. She often steals away
here for amoment to write and we children know
just where to find her, She loves the small east
window on the second landing of the stairway,
whose crystal prisms cast rainbows of color from
the sun's first rays or the beams of a rising moon.
How often we stand together and watch the full
moon through that prism-bordered window,

I see mother ill and hardly able to walk
though still courageous, after the birth of little
Phillip, staying upstairs in the Rose-room or
being carried downstairs inthe strong arms of
father. I see her struggling to regain her health
by faithfully taking ''Susanna Schowcroft's Physical
Exercises", which she orders by mail; I see her
powdering the backs of her hands to soothe the
clusters of tiny itching red blisters which are
aggravated by both heat and water and forerunners
of the acute Bright's disease that is eventually to
take her. I see her embarrassed by the sores on
these same precious hands, so covering them with
gloves whenever she goes out in public.

But mostly I see mother Jennie as the
talented, creative, enthusiastic and wonderful
woman all who really knew her remember, Her
vibrant, outgoing personality radiated courage and
faith and a deep love for all of our Heavenly
Father's creations. As Elaine wrote, ''Jennie
loved everything beautiful: the sighing of the wind
in the elms, the chirp of crickets in the hush of
evening, the raspy rustling of corn in the shock,
the changing panorama of clouds in a ribboned sky,
the lyrical rippling of waters, the consonant music
of nature, or the dissonant music of life.'' In fact,
Jennie loved life. Though she was very human her
spirit seemed to soar above the clouds of ordinary
living and was able to take others with it to some
degree, especially us, her children,

Even from the beginning, her vivid imagina-
tion and power of poetic expression made the things
<span id="page-??"></span>
563 Albert

about us live and tingle in our minds and hearts.
She gave us new eyes, new ears, new understand-
ing. And while she entertained and delighted us,
she taught and disciplined in poetry, song and
story. She ran the gamut of noble emotions from
the simple to the sublime, and we followed along.
She tuned the strings of our creative impulses and
made them want to sing!

Her children's stories were unforgettable
and had their settings in places familiar to our
experiences, The one about the ''Two Little Mud
Girls", Dottie and Pearl who came to life, might
easily have taken place in the garden and barnyard
of our first home, for here were chickens, currant
bushes, often toadstools that came up after a rain,
Madsen's unfriendly pigeons that roosted in our
barn, stray cats, our granary next to the barn
that was plagued with mice, Uncle Gard and Aunt
Esther Snow's white ducks that swam in the big
irrigation ditch between our two yards, and plenty
of nice, clean, soft dirt for making mud pies. ''Be
careful little mud girls - the world is very big and
you are very little, '' said the friendly chicken to
Pearl and Dottie; but the advice was really for little
Elaine and Virginia, given by their loving mother.

"Longshanks and Tockadoo!'! could have been
set in our old barnyard, Sometimes even now,
when I'm tempted to brag, I think of the rooster
Tockadoo and his bedraggled tail feathers, The
story of 'Old Thunder and the White Cloud" must
have had its setting in the old County Block, not
far from our home. ''Two sisters and a Prince!
brought forcefully to mind the old adage: "Beauty
is as beauty does",

"Old Santa Claus'*, a happy Christmas adven-
ture in verse, was made up by mother for me to
give at a school Christmas program when I was
around nine; in fact, the Christmas we first spent
in our new home, She dictated the last part of it
to me while she was mixing bread the morning just
before the program. She helped me memorize the
poem within the hour, with appropriate gestures,
emphasis and inflections. For more than fifty
years since then her descendants, to the third
generation, have retold this Christmas poem at as
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 564

many Christmas Eve family home evenings, Her
beautiful Christmas song, ''One Christmas Day",
for which she composed both words and music, has
also been given by her descendants on numbers of
such occasions,

It was some time before she wrote ''Old Santa
Claus" that mother began training Elaine and me to
sing and dance and do dramatic skits together, As
Iremember, our initial public performance was in
"Bobby Shafto', a sad tale in song, which we pre-
sented in conjunction with a Stake Primary Carnival
in the Manti Tabernacle. A friend, Maud Ewing,
took the boy's part and Elaine and I were the two
sisters, Aunt Retta Neff rushed into town the day
before the performance, bringing beautiful old-
fashioned bonnets and long, full dresses for Elaine
and me to wear. We were asked to repeat 'Bobby
Shafto'' at a later date and our cousin, Reva Riddle,
took the boy's part then.

For several successive years after that
Elaine and I were featured on yearly money raising
variety shows put on by the Primary in conjunction
with the local picture shows, Each year our names
and pictures in costume appeared on bulletin boards
outside the theatre; they seemed to think our acts
were some sort of ''drawing cards.'' One year we
were a Dutch couple with appropriate costumes and
real wooden shoes, We sang ''Lena, my Lena
Smidt' and did a noisy Dutch clog, Another year
we were an Indian couple and still another we were
a couple of village ''rubes'' singing ''Mornin' Cy,
Howdy Cy, Gosh darn Cyrus but you're lookin' spry.!"!
Then we locked arms shoulder high in the latest and
most daring fashion and did a ragtime dance that
brought the house down, Mother certainly knew
how to put a song and dance together and what she
didn't know Aunt Retta could add.

ITalways remember mother looking her very
best whether at home or in public. Inever saw
her untidy, unless occasional errant curls straying
over her brow could be called such. When she went
out in public with our tall father as her escort she
liked to appear as tall as possible, Then she pinned
her curls high on top of her head and topped them
with a bob fashioned from a switch she had hired
<span id="page-??"></span>
565 Albert

made from her own hair combings, She wore the
highest heels she could buy on her small two-and-
a-half size shoes, which had to be special ordered
through the local merchants, I seldom saw her in
bright colored apparel, for she most always wore
the darker shades of brown, gray, blue, green,
and of course black. Perhaps this is why I remem-
ber so well the dress she wore on that last New
Year's Eve when she attended a dinner dance with
father. It was an evening gown of softest salmon
pink satin with long, fitted skirt and elbow length
sleeves, Over each shoulder ran several narrow
pink satin straps, each centered with a small black
satin button, I stood on a chair beside her with
needle and thread and tacked the straps in place to
please her, Long, black silk gloves completed her
costume, Mother looked so beautiful to me that
night. Seven months from then she was in her
grave,

"Aside from the memory of that wonderful
woman, ''Sherman writes, ''time has left us nothing
more closely touching her character and very being
than the fragments of her soul which she placed
upon paper, In her children's stories she brought
two little mud girls to life, not to mention the
animals and birds and flowers that she translated
into mortality for the delight of young minds, In .
her more serious poems she caught the most pro-
found undertones of humanity and religion for the
delight of the soul. (Included in this category is
''The Wise Man" which won for her first place in
the Deseret News Christmas poetry contest of
1910,) Between the two, in verse and story, she
has woven a golden mesh of love and devotion,
courage and pathos, romance and happiness for
the delight of the heart.'' May we share two of
her lovely poems?

A Toy, A Little Shoe, and Memory

One childish shout brings back the dead days sweet -
A shout now wafted on the summer air

Rolls back the years and brings the days once fair,
And I can hear the patter of his feet,

And I can hear his shrill, commanding calls... ,
There stands my boy in wee blue overalls.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 566

Time was those shouts brought angry words and tears
And muddy, tracking feet received a frown,

And clinging, restless fingers soiled my gown,

But those same feet went marching with the years
Until they marched away; the tearing hands

Are doing worthy tasks in foreign lands,

The years have turned to music those shouts wild,
I'd give the world if I could feel them now -

His baby fingers, fondling o'er my brow,

Oh years! Why did you rob me of my child

And leave a half-worn picture book to me,

A toy. .. A little shoe, . . And memory?

Song of a Soul

Out of the vast eternity I came
And from thee, Lord.

I, that was free, by flesh and blood am bound,
Bound at thy word,

While through the mystery of life I grope
Where is there balm
Save in the memory of that vast home
Which bids me calm?

And in the prison walls of flesh and blood
I sing my song, ;

I dream my dreams - poor, chained, rebellious dreams
Which fade ere long,

I shall be free when all that is of earth
Beneath the sod

Is laid; then back to the Eternity
And thee, Oh God!

It has been more than sixty years since Jennie
Snow Christensen sang her songs and dreamed her
dreams, yet her songs and dreams continue to live,
but especially in the hearts of us, her children. I
am sure.I myself have fallen far short of her expec-
tations, yet the memory of this precious mother has
sparked some of my noblest efforts, humble though
they have been. She made her limited life one of
boundless giving of the beauty of her spirit, like a

Myrtle Farnsworth Christensen, second wife
of Albert '"H", was born 30 July 1885. She could
be proud of her heritage for all four of her grand-
parents were early Utah Mormon Pioneers worthy
of note. Her maternal grandfather, Marcus
D'Lafette Shepherd, whose father had been an
aide-de-camp to General George Washington
during the American Revolution, became a
member of the Mormon Battalion, was in on the
gold rush in California and panned gold at Sutter's
Mill. Returning to Salt Lake City he presented his
sweetheart, Harriet Editha Pharish, with a sack
of gold nuggets as a wedding gift. They settled
first in San Bernadino Valley but later sold their
property there for a goodly sum of money and used
this to buy machinery with which to set up a woolen
mill in Beaver, Utah, where they were called to
colonize by Brigham Young. A cotton mill in
St. George and a shoe factory in Parawan were
set up about the same time by others.

Myrtle's paternal grandfather, Philo Taylor
Farnsworth, who migrated to Utah with the early
Saints in 1848, was immediately called to go back
to Winter Quarters with wagons and supplies to
assist in bringing destitute saints to Utah. Again
and again he made these trips and on one of them
met a young English convert, Margaret Yates,

He helped her to come to Zion, where they were
wed, The couple were sent south to Fillmore,
Utah to help settle that place, but later, in 1856,
Brother Farnsworth was called to Beaver to be-
come Bishop there, Myrtle's father was then but
a young child. Her grandfather became a poly-
gamist and had four wives and thirty children.

The Farnsworth and Shepherd children grew
up together in Beaver, The Farnsworths had many
struggles trying to feed and clothe their large
family, but were enterprising and hard working.
The Shepherds were considered well-to-do and
their children were given every advantage. In
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 568

1866 Brother Shepherd built the first brick home
in Beaver, a huge eighty by thirty three-story
dwelling modeled after the Prophet Joseph Smith's
home in Nauvoo. It was long called ''The Shepherd
Mansion', He also built a brick granary nearby.
Among the furnishings in this home was a large
grand piano which the Shepherds secured when
Fort Cameron was abandoned by the U. S, Soldiers,
It had been brought in for the wife of the Fort's
Major and was said to be the only such piano in the
valleys then, except the one owned by President
Brigham Young.

When Myrtle's parents, William Henry Farns-
worth and Harriet Susanna Shepherd, were first
married they lived in Beaver for awhile where her
father worked first as a telegrapher and then in a
store, He then homesteaded some farming land
about nineteen miles north of Beaver at what was
known as Pine Creek Ranch. Here inthe ranch
shack of logs Myrtle was born, the fourth of seven
children, When she was two and her new baby
brother was six months, their father left ona
mission to England for the L. D. S. Church. Her
mother and the five children went to live in the
Shepherd Mansion, where grandfather Shepherd
took care of them for the thirty months Myrtle's
father was away.

During his absence grandmother Shepherd
died, Uponher father, William Farnsworth's
return, he and his wife and family were given the
large home and grandfather Shepherd went to live
with his polygamist wife a block away. Myrtle's
father was made manager of the Beaver Woolen
Mills and served as such for the next five years.
The large home was remodeled to better fit the
needs of the Farnsworth family. Though several
bedrooms occupied one wing of the second floor,

a large recreation hall 50 by 30 ft. occupied the
other. Community meetings, programs and dances
were held here. The old brick granary was turned
into the city jail for atime. Many's the tale that
could be told of those days,

Myrtle's mother had several sisters and they
and their families flocked back to the old home on
many occasions, Myrtle and her sisters and cousins
<span id="page-??"></span>
569 Albert

had free access to the large attic and their grand-
mother Shepherd's trunks of beautiful clothes and
bonnets she had brought across the plains, as well
as to the old spinning wheel. Many were the home
dramatics held by candlelight in that old attic.
Myrtle's mother's family was a singing family and
all used to sing around the table following a family
meal inthe huge dining room. Her mother, Harriet,
and her Aunt Sadie often accompanied them on their
guitars,

Early day Beaver was very educationally
minded and prided itself on its good spellers,
grammarians, mathematicians, as well as singers,
The small town was blessed with excellent music
teachers, This, together with native ability and
training in the home, was an advantage to Myrtle
and her brothers and sisters and they all sang well.
Myrtle can hardly remember when she couldn't
Sing alto. She joined the Ward choir when in her
early teens - they all did. Later her brother Karl
Sang in the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir for years,

Myrtle grew up in Beaver among her four
sisters and two brothers and cousins by the dozens.
She was a healthy, pretty girl, rather large for
her age, and with an inner urge towards tomboyish-
ness which she felt was very distasteful to her —
prim little mother and sedate older sisters. She
had an optimistic and happy nature and a generous
heart and she was loved by many.

At that time most of the Farnsworth family's
clothing was made from Woolen Mill products, or
from cotton cloth they traded for from the cotton
milles in St. George, Every garment was
remodeled and passed down as long as there was
anything of it left, The family shoes were secured
by trading woolen goods from their Beaver mill
for high button shoes made at the Parawan Shoe
Factory, Though they may have thought these
shoes ugly and ill-fitting, it was their patriotic
duty to wear them nevertheless, Though funda-
mentally plain in her tastes, Myrtle longed for
pretty clothes, and her first pair of ''real store
shoes'' was an experience she treasured with
happiness,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 570

She attended the first four grades at the
Beaver District school in the three-room schooi-
house, heated by an old pot-bellied stove with a
long stovepipe that ran overhead across the room,
which was always falling down and sending a
shower of soot upon the slates and copy books.

She attended fifth grade at B. Y. U. Training
School in Provo where her mother took the children
for the winter while her father did some remodeling
onthe home, Returning to Beaver, Myrtle skipped
sixth grade and took seventh and eighth grades in
turn, She was among the seven to be graduated
from the eighth grade of Beaver District school

in 1889.

From the time Myrtle was old enough to
dream of a life of service she had a longing to
teach. It was sometime while attending elementary
school in Beaver-that she began to teach in the
Sunday School, From then on she taught Sunday
School. some place or another every single year
for some thirty years and then off and on for
another fifteen, making a total of some forty-five
years she served as a teacher in the Sunday Schools
of the Church. .

Following her graduation from eighth grade
she stayed out of school a year to help in the home.
She acted as tithing clerk in her Ward that year,
The fall of 1900 she entered the Murdock Academy,
which had taken over the place once known as Fort
Cameron near Beaver and was in its third year.
She completed three years of high school work
there the spring of 1903, which was all the Academy
offered at that time. She then attended summer
school at B. Y. U. and in the fall began her long-
dreamed-of public teaching career in the little
town of Frisco in southern Utah, where she taught
the first four grades that winter of 1903/04. From
here on she became self-supporting and also was
able to assist other members of her family in
getting their educations,

The summer and winter of 1904/05 she
attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City
to complete her work for a Normal certificate,
Here she walked off with the honor of being among
the three highest in scholarship for the four quarters,

The next winter she taught fifth and sixth grades
in the Farmington District school and then went to
Summer school at the Utah State Agricultural
College in Logan,

The fall of 1906 Myrtle went to Manti to
teach and taught there three successive winters,
teaching fifth grade, first grade and seventh grade
inturn, It was here she first met the lawyer A. H.
Christensen, who was a member of the Board of
Trustees of the Manti High School and closely asso-
ciated with her brother-in-law, Edgar T, Reid.
But she thought nothing of it at the time. She
spent the three alternate summers in summer
school, the first at the A. C. and the next two
at the U. of U. She then returned to her home
town of Beaver where she taught the fourth grade
that winter,

For quite a while a desire had been growing
within her to learn more about sewing. It was
impossible to buy well-fitting, properly styled
dresses in most towns in Utah. Women had to
depend on their own untrained abilities or on the
services of expensive, busy and mostly poorly-
trained dressmakers, Myrtle believed if women
could be taught to make their own clothes skillfully
that this would add a great deal to their lives. So
she stayed at home in Beaver the following year,
taking a correspondence course from the 'Brown's
School of Sewing" of Salt Lake City during the
summer and fall and doing a great deal of pro-
fessional sewing during the winter.

But again, she may have stayed home that.
winter mainly because of a very serious matri-
monial decision she was required to make, Sewing
gave her more time to think than teaching. She
finally decided against marrying at that time be-
cause of a difference in religious ideals. This
was only one of several such decisions she had to
make over the next few years however, for besides
being so well trained she was excellent company,
very popular, and a beautiful woman, all in all,
She was much sought after, even by a certain poly-
gamist whose proposal of marriage she turned down
with much distaste, She allowed herself to become
engaged twice - but broke those engagements, It
<span id="page-??"></span>

seemed that marriage was not for her at that time.

The summer of 1911 she again went to sum-
mer school at the A. C, in Logan for the first
session, then attended the ''Kiester Sewing School!
there the latter part of the summer, Then she
returned to teaching, this time at the Cove school
in the very small community of Sevier, some miles
south of Richfield, Utah. Here she spent the next
three winters, teaching the first four elementary
grades the first winter and acting as Principal the
next two. Some of her choicest memories stem
from that period, as she felt she was performing
a very worthy mission there aside from her school
responsibilities,

Unlike the preceding teachers in the small
community of Sevier, who commuted back and
forth much of the time, Myrtle took up her residence
there where they had never sent out a misSionary,
never had an eighth grade graduate, never had an
M. I, A. organization, and where the people, old
and young, were literally starved for the finer
things of life and truly neglected. Under her
direction the small schoolhouse became a hub of
activity during those three winters, The Sunday
School was reactivated and an M. I. A. organized,
On M, I. A, nights young and old came from farm
houses near and far with lanterns and lamps to
light the small school house, pleading to stay "just
a little longer''as they listened to the reading of a
fine novel, some bits of poetry, or joined in singing
and religious worship, They were given new vision,
not only religious but educational and cultural as
well. 'Miss Farnsworth" became not only the
teacher, religious advisor, cultural stimulator,
but also the counselor, nurse, and even the midwife
on a few occasions, There were fewer school 'drop-
outs'' and several students went on to graduate from
eighth grade and she was able to assist them in
getting registered later at the Murdock Academy
at Beaver to begin their higher educations,

Myrtle's three winters at Sevier were inter-
spersed with two terms of summer school at the
U. of U.; for as she stimulated others to reach
higher she increased her own resolve to do so, At
the close of her last winter's teaching at Sevier,
<span id="page-??"></span>

in order to have her credentials more complete,
she herself went back to the Murdock Academy,
which by then had become a four year high school,
and in six weeks passed off her fourth year of high
school training and received her high school
diploma. :

Then Myrtle left immediately for Chicago,
Illinois, where she spent the rest of that summer
at the University of Chicago specializing in food
preparation, sewing, art, and the social treatment
of crime, She visited art galleries, exhibits,
museums, concerts and the beauty spots of nature,
where she drank in the culture of that beautiful |
city - such a contrast to the poverty of the little |
old town of Sevier. This proved to be a glorious
summer for her, . :

“She returned to Manti to teach Domestic ~

School for a year, Then she went back to Beaver.
and taught the same subjects plus Physiology, _in
the Murdock Academy for the next two years. She
was persuaded to return to the Manti High School,
where this time she commanded the highest salary
of any teacher.in that district, This was the fall
of 1917. She taught there for the next three winters
and then resigned her position to become the wife
of the widower, Judge A. H. Christensen, Their
marriage took place in the St. George Temple,

23 June 1920, |

Albert was most fortunate to get sucha
woman as a second mother for his five children -
and well he must have known it, for Myrtle brought
not only expert training and unusual skill to the
management of his household but great dedication
and unselfish love as well, The children fondly
called her "Aunt Myrtle" from the beginning and -
she accepted this with understanding and grace.
She had a wonderful influence for good on the lives
of these children over the ensuing years, as. she.
of course did over the lives of her own three
children who came to bless the home,

Phillip tells something of this influence; --
"Then came the day when I was about eight and a
half years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the family.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 574

I guess I was kind of a sickly looking little fellow
then because she certainly took me in hand, I was
finicky about what I ate and especially hated eggs.
But there were things I 'adored' and those were
Aunt Myrtle's creampuffs with that good filling
inside and chocolate ontop. She put me under
orders, however, that until I ate my eggs and other
food I couldn't have any creampuffs and she cer-
tainly did enforce those rules, much to my good,
Though I had never eaten eggs if I could get out of
it, she fixed them for me special by breaking them
into a glass then putting the glass into a pan of
boiling water until the eggs cooked up and were
really delicious.

"Through the years this dear woman saw to
it that Iwas given good, nourishing food and I give
her credit for pulling me out of the doldrums. Now,
as Llook back, I can see how silly I was in the things
I liked to eat, but the training from Aunt Myrtle
must have borne good fruits because my wonderful
wife, Gwen, says I will now eat anything and refers
to me in an endearing way as her ‘disposal’,

"T recall the day when I was about to leave
our home in Orem for Salt Lake City where I was
to take a bus to Washington, D. C. to join the
F.B.1, and really go out into the great big world
on my very own, I had my things packed, had
taken a picture of Mt. Timpanogos, and was lying
on the couch asleep, or nearly so. I recall Aunt
Myrtle coming and bending over me, apparently
asleep there on the couch, and in her sweet way
kissing me and saying fervently 'God bless you',
I say God bless you Aunt Myrtle for all you have
done for me over these many years!"

As the family grew in number Myrtle had a
way of drawing the shy new son-in-law into the
inner family circle by giving him a chair to repair
or alight switch to mend, She had the new
daughter-in-law accompany her on shopping trips
and consulted her on the selection of new outfits.
She won the new grandchild over by letting her
help roll and cut out cookies, by swinging her on
the old bed springs swing south of the house, or
by taking her onto her own comfortable lap and
rocking her in the big rocking chair - all the time
<span id="page-??"></span>

singing lullabies in her deep, rich contralto, until
she had put both herself and the little one to sleep.

Myrtle did much community service both
before and after her marriage. Her war work
during World War I and her humane efforts nursing
the sick during the great flu epidemic which both
accompanied and followed it, were worthy of note
as was her service during World War II making
parachutes and doing other war sewing. She was
a member of the ''Hopeless Club" in Manti for
years and was an active participant in the Utah
Sorosis Club of Provo for fifteen years while
living in Orem, where her literary knowledge was
used to benefit many. She worked long hard hours
helping to get the Scera Center in Orem started.
She did a lot in Four H Club work for young girls.
She was active in P.T. A. work in various com-
munities and served as president of the Orem
organization for some time.

Aside from her service to her large and
active family, however, her service to the Church
was perhaps the most rewarding, This she never
neglected. Besides teaching in the Sunday Schools
some forty-five years or more, she taught numbers
of years in the M.I.A. and served as president of
the Young Ladies in Beaver Ward and then coun-
selor in the Stake organization. She also served
as Ward President of the Y.L.M.1I.A. one year
in Orem, She was president of the ward Primary
there for seven years. She served on the Stake
Board of the Relief Society while living in Orem
and was class leader in all departments of the
society on a Ward level at one time or another
during the years, She spent part of the last two _
winters preceding her husband's death working
for the dead in the St. George Temple. . In fact,
it was only a week or so after the two returned
from laboring there that Albert passed away
(13 Mar. 1957).

With Albert's passing, a wonderful companion-
ship of nearly thirty-seven years was ended, as
far as this earthly life was concerned, Though
those years were tempered by both joy and sorrow,
yet on the whole they had held far more of joy than
of sorrow. Albert left Myrtle comfortably situated
<span id="page-??"></span>
Albert 576

and her health was good, She had had comparatively
few sick days in her lifetime and was still able to
take good care of herself. Nevertheless, she
decided to sell her home in Orem and go and live
with one or the other of her daughters, Norma and
Kathryn, in places such as Washington, D, C.,
Bloomington, Indiana, Palo Alto, California, and
in Salt Lake City, whither time took them, She
knew she could still be of service to them and

their young families and she desired this, Now,

at age past eighty-three, she resides with Norma
(Webster) and her Bishop husband and family in Salt
Lake City, where she is still pretty much able to
take care of herself at this writing. Only Norma
and Kathryn can tell of the magnanimity of her
services to them and theirs over the past twelve
years,

Myrtle still has that sweet modesty that
evidences faith in the ability of others and a willing-
ness to allow them full credit, and more. In her
exceptional memory she cannot tear herself apart
from those with whom she has mingled - her life's
story seems to be mirrored in the lives and
accomplishments of others, Her appreciation for
the actions and kindnesses of others is never
failing. ''Thank you for a wonderful day", a brief
statement given in low vibrant tones from the heart,
is so typical of this most gracious lady, the last
remaining member of her generation of Christensens,

Perhaps nothing can better show the closeness
of this family's alliance or the deep respect of each
member of it for "Aunt Myrtle" than the words ofa
letter written to her by Sherman just a month before
the death of father, in recognition of her nomination
as a candidate for the honor of Mother of the Year
for the State of Utah. (She was awarded the place
of ''first alternate'' to the woman chosen not long
after father's death. )

12 February 1957
"Dear Aunt Myrtle:

"T have just learned that you have been nom-
inated for consideration as 'Mother of the Year,'
Feelings such as those I feel now ordinarily remain
locked in the heart until occasions. like this make

an opening for their expression, Of course, after
a fashion, we communicate them from day to day,
but in such a subtle way that only the ones directly
involved know fully what is meant. These things
we have both understood, Iam sure. The kiss of
greeting, a touch of the hand, the wordless comfort
of seeing each other, the 'Merry Christmases’,
'Happy New Years' and 'Happy Birthdays' and 'Be
My Valentines' of the whirling cycles, and the
homey visits which now renew the memory of our
day-by-day companionship and love over the years.

"But now, I find that others have been more
articulate in first applying to you the honored title
of 'Mother of the Year'. I wholeheartedly concur,
and hasten to add this expression of my congratula-
tions, admiration and love. Yet I-cannot think of
you in terms of but a single year, for you have
been to us, indeed, 'Mother of the Years',

"My mind turns back to that day almost forty
years ago, when the loss of my own mother was
still vivid and cruel and I rode with you by train
to Manti from Salt Lake City where I had been
staying with Aunt Retta during the preceding school
year, Sometime later you and Dad were married,
Ihave seen you make three different houses into
homes since then, keep up with the finer things of
life in art, music and literature, and inspire all
of us to do so, keep aware of the problems of
neighbors and the world and help to solve both,
and raise not only another woman's children but
your own also, all together as a family unit,
graciously, efficiently and lovingly, without divi-
sion and without distinction, And though we and
ours are now scattered across the country and
beyond, our thoughts are turned constantly to
home, which remains simply where you and Dad
are,

"May God bless you, not only for what you
now are to us -- The Mother of the Year -- but
for what you have been to all of us over the years
gone by.

Affe ctionately, Sherman. ''

(5) ELSIE KATHRINE CHRISTENSEN (Bartholomew)

Elsie, the first daughter born to Laurs and
Else Christensen and the first of the three children
born to them in Mayfield, first saw the light 8 Mar.
1875, A twin sister arrived shortly after and since
there was some question as to whether either of the
tiny girls would survive they were each blessed and
given names right away. The twin sister was given
the name Mary Karen, by her father Laurs, but she
was usually referred to after that as ''Karrie'', She
died shortly after she was named and blessed, The
early Gunnison Ward records show that Elsie was
blessed and named that day by W. N. Tofte and
given the same name as her mother had been
christened, Else Catherine, but her name spelling
was later modernized to Elsie Kathrine,

Elsie was born in a log cabin in North May-
field while her parents were members of the United
Order there. She was past two when they left the
Order and went to live in South Mayfield, She was
just past four when her mother left the family in
Mayfield with her father and a Mrs, Anderson in
charge and went to Salt Lake City to study medicine.
The year after (1880), when Elsie was just past five,
the family moved back to Gunnison where they had
lived before coming to Mayfield, but they spent the
next several summers in Christenburg where her
father leased a farm.

Her parents built a new rock house on property
they purchased in northwest Gunnison and here Elsie
lived most of the rest of her life until she was mar-
ried, It was from here that she went to the Sanpitch
River to be baptized a member of the L.D.S.
Church, 2 July 1884, by Jens Jensen, It was here
that she went to the church nearby the day after,

3 July 1884, and was confirmed by Jens Larsen,
and it was from here that she went to receive a
patriarchal blessing from Christian August Madsen,
former Gunnison Bishop, on 15 Apr. 1901, not long
before her marriage.

Elsie started school in Gunnison the year she
was six and the school was held not far from their

rock house. We are fortunate to be able to copy
much of the remainder of her history from her own
record, which she placed in her ''Book of Remem-
brance''’, We quote from this;-- "One thing I
remember when I started school in Gunnison,
Augusta Swalberg, my teacher, made me stand up
by her table for talking. I cried so loud she couldn't
go on with her teaching so she told me to go to my
seat, In my first two years.of school I had learned
my readers sothat I could recite them through by
memory, The next three years spelling, reading
and arithmetic were taught. Ward Stevens was the
teacher, The time I liked best was during recess
when Emma Metcalf and I played baseball with the
big boys, one of us on each side, We were good
batters and fast on the run, On Fourth of July I
took part in a running contest; as first prize I
received a beautiful blue feather fan,

"At the age of fourteen I went to the Snow
Academy in Ephraim, Sanpete, Utah, which had
been founded the year before (5 Nov. 1888). The
upstairs of the old Co-op Store there was the resi-
dence of the institution. Alma Greenwood was then
its president and he was assisted by a Miss Henry.
The Academy was just a preparatory and inter-
mediate school,

"The fall of the next year (1890) I kept house
for my father while mother and a foster child, Ada,
went to Denmark to visit her folks. After they
returned home I attended the Seminary held in
Gunnison Ward and taught by Brother Joseph Jen-
sen, This I started in January 1891. That fall I
went to Provo with my brothers Joseph and Albert
and Vio Sorenson to attend the Brigham Young
Academy. Vio's grandmother, Sister Capson,
kept house for us. The school was held in the
Z.C.M.1, warehouse near the depot, which was
the best that could be had at the time. But on ©
Monday, 4 Jan. 1892, teachers and students
marched to the new building for the B, Y.A,
between 5th and 6th North on Academy Ave. The
veteran educator, Karl G. Maeser, was released
as president of the school and Benjamin Cluff
installed as his successor, I continued school in ©
winters at B.Y.A. until 21 May 1896, when I was
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 580

graduated from that institution and received the
degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy. My diploma was
signed by Nelson Duesenberry, President of the
School Board, and Benjamin Ciuff, President of
the Academy.

"My first year of teaching school was at
Hinckley, Millard Co., Utah. The next two years
I taught at Centerfield, next to Gunnison, In the
winter of 1899/1900 I returned to B, Y. A. again,
at Provo, to further my education in literature,
taught by Alice Louise Reynolds; music, piano
and harmony under A, C. Lund; and religion
taught by George Reynolds, with special lectures
on the Bible and Book of Mormon given by Dr,
Whitney of Salt Lake City. While attending B. Y.A.
at this time I taught a class in Sunday School in the
Ward in which I lived and Emma Lucy Gates, who
later became famous as a singer, was in my class,
Miss Susan Talmage and I were counselors to
Mrs. Snow in M.1,A. that same year,

'The fall of 1900 I returned to teach school
in Centerfield again until May 1901. Then on 26
June 1901 Iwas married to Alma C, Bartholomew
of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah in the Manti Temple by
Temple President John D, T. McAllister, That
evening my parents gave us a very elaborate wedding
reception in their home in Gunnison, There were
one hundred invited guests, including four Bishops,
and a big supper was served to all, as was the
custom,

"The next day we went to Fayette and lived
with my husband's folks for nearly a year. Our
first son, Alma Owen, was born in an upstairs
bedroom of their home, 1 May 1902, both grand-
mothers being in attendance, my mother Else as
midwife and Alma's mother Eliza to care for our
needs, We moved from there to a Mellor house,
where our second son, Edgar, was born 20 Aug.
1903. Then we bought and remodeled the Brown
house in Fayette and here our next two sons were
born, Byard 2 Mar. 1905 and Clifton 24 Nov. 1906.

"In June 1907, when Clifton was just past six
months old, we bought a beautiful new red brick
home in Gunnison from Lafe Bown - and here we

settled.'' Sorrow caught up with Elsie's and Alma's
family when on 18 Dec, 1909 their beautiful little
son, Byard, passed away. He lacked less than
three months of being five years old. Byard had
never had a strong heart and though everything
they could do had been done for him, he did not
survive. Elsie and her mother were alone with
the child when death came for him; Alma was on
the desert with the sheep. (A more detailed
account of Byard's death is given earlier in the
book, )

Two daughters were born to Elsie and Alma
in the new red brick home in Gunnison; Edith 10
Feb. 1910, less than two months after little |
Byard's death, and Ella May 10 May 1912, Elsie
continues with her history:-- 'I have always had
great faith in prayer and the Lord has helped me
so many times when I have been sick or in trouble.
One such incident stands out in my mind. After
Ellamae (or Ella May) was born there were many
months when I felt poorly. When she was three
years old I went to Dr, Olsten in Manti, a specialist
in women's diseases, Iwas told that I hada
cancerous condition, I had to visit him three times
a week for three months, going from Gunnison to
Manti and back for these treatments, (This was
the early part of the winter of 1915/16). On these
days each week, after I had sent my boys off to
school, I started with my two little girls in a one-
horse open buggy for Manti. We had mittens,
hoods, hot irons at our feet and a lap robe to
cover us, One day it began snowing soon after we
started so we were well covered with the wet snow
when we reached my parents’ home in Manti.
Father was there to take care of the horse, Mother
took the girls and had a hot lunch prepared for us.
Then I went for my treatment. When I came into
the doctor's office he took me by the shoulders
and said, 'Woman, woman; you have the faith to
remove mountains! If Mrs, Andersen had half the
faith you have, she could get well too.' (Mrs.
Andersen was a cousin of mine and was being
treated by Dr, Olsten for the same trouble as I -
she did not get well), I answered, 'I must get
well, I have little ones that need me!' (That was
over forty years ago and here lam 81, Ihave been
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 582

made well many times by faith, prayer and works -
'Praise God from whom all blessings flow. . .')"'

Troubles sometimes come in pairs or more
and this was a very difficult winter for Elsie. Be-
sides her worrisome illness, she and her husband
had had a serious misunderstanding. Elsie was a
very proud woman and this must have been very
difficult for her to bear. Alma continued to stay
away with the sheep and Elsie struggled with her
problems alone. But she was not of pure blooded
Danish extraction for nothing - her determination
(some call it stubbornness) knew no bounds. Be-
sides, as she has stated, she had much faith in
prayer. She continues with her own history:--
"We sold our lovely home to my brother Arthur
Christensen and took his old home, which had once
belonged to brother Chris, in onthe deal. Here
the children and I moved the latter part of 1915 -
Alma was with the sheep.

"On 27 Mar. 1916 the children and I and my
brother Lou's family left Gunnison by train headed
for Lyman, Wyoming. The night before we all
stayed at my sister Emma's, since she only lived
about a mile from the depot. We took up a home-
stead about six miles east of Lyman, Wyoming,
rather close to a ranch owned by my brother Chris.
Lou also took up homestead land there and my
brother Andrew and Chris' daughter Pearl, and
later my sister Elvena, making about 2,320 acres
in all which we called 'The Oasis', The children
and I worked hard clearing the sagebrush, doing
some planting of crops and garden and making the
necessary improvements to prove up on our home-
stead property for two difficult summers. In
winters we rented a place in Lyman, Wyoming and
moved into town so the children could go to school,"
A story is told about Elsie when she was living in
Lyman, She was herding her cows as they grazed
on the ditch bank not far from her home there,
taking particular pains to avoid the mud puddles
left by a recent storm. Some people drove up to
her place in a buggy - she wasn't expecting com-
pany. She strained her eyes in their direction and
suddenly she recognized that it was her brother
Arthur and his wife Millie. In her joy she plowed
<span id="page-??"></span>
583 Elsie

right through the mud puddles in her haste to greet
them, which she did with hugs and kisses but with
wet, muddy shoes and skirt.

At the end of two years of struggle in Wyoming,
during which time "firebugs" had threatened to drive
them from their homestead, crops had been burned
belonging to her brother Chris, her brother Lou's
house had been set on fire, and Chris himself had
finally lost his life there, Elsie had met the terms
of the homestead act and the place was hers, Many
a time during that period she had stood with a gun
at nights guarding her log house on ''The Oasis",
and her young sons had stood guard beside her.

Sometime in the interim, or at least by the
end of those two desperate years, Elsie and Alma
effected a reconciliation. Elsie and the children
joined Alma in Ogden, Utah, the spring of 1918 and
the family were reunited. They lived in Ogden until
the following spring, the children attending school
there that winter, and then returned together to —
Lyman, Wyoming for another year, at the request
of the children. Elsie continues her story: "In
the spring of 1920 we moved to Goshen, Utah and
rented the Robert Boswell farm there. In the four-
roomed adobe farm house on this place our third
daughter and last child, LaPreal, was born,

8 Feb. 1921. :

"Alma and our oldest son, A, Owen, obtained
employment at the Tintic Standard Mine carpenter
shop in Dividend, Alma first and A, Owen later,
and so we moved into the town of Goshen, renting
the John Morgan home for a short time and then
moving into a larger house there owned by Hazel
Done, I became active in the Goshen Ward, enjoy-
ing the work very much, For some time I was in
the presidency of the Relief Society. Iwas called
to sing in duets and choruses on many occasions,
was a class leader in the Relief Society most of
my time there and taught the adult class in Sunday
School, I loved the people there and in turn had
many friends,

‘In the spring of 1931 we moved to Payson,
Utah, where we had just finished building a new
brick house at 369 North 3rd East, (This lovely
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 584

home Elsie lived in the rest of her days in Payson. )
We had not gotten settled when Mrs. Bona, Relief
Society President in our new Payson Ward, called
at our home and asked me to be the Literary class
teacher for that organization. I held that position
for two years and then was asked to be the Theology
class leader, which position I accepted and filled
for eight or ten years. My health then became

poor (she suffered from a heart ailment), and I

was released from all responsibility at that time.
When I became stronger I taught the Literary
lessons for another year. On 4 June 1952 I was

set apart as a visiting teacher in the Relief Society
by Brother Harold Rasmusson of Payson.

"TI joined the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers
(D. U.P.) in 1934, Payson Camp 1. Iwas elected
chorister of this organization 19 May 1940, Regis-
trar 19 May 1945 and chosen Parliamentarian in
1948. Iwas sent as a delegate to the County con-
vention and was elected second vice captain and
class leader, which position I held until March
1956. Ihave also been a Sunday School teacher
in the Old Testament department during these
Payson years."

Elsie's husband, Alma, was set apart as
Bishop of their Payson Fourth Ward 13 Jan. 1952,
and served a full two years before being forced to
be released because of poor health. Though he was
three and a half years younger than Elsie, yet he
was more frail and had suffered from ulcers for
many years, He passed away in a Payson hospital
following surgery, 6 Mar. 1954. After his death
Elsie continued to live on in their comfortable
home in Payson. Her unmarried son, Edgar, was
there with her when he could be and helped support
her in all ways - in fact he was wonderful to her!
Her oldest son, A. Owen, and family lived right
next door and kept an eye on her also, until it
became necessary for her to have someone with
her much of the time. Finally she went to live with
Edith, her oldest daughter, in her home in Provo,
Edith, a Ph D in the department of advanced educa-
tion at Brigham Young University, was of necessity
away from home a great deal but she had a girl with
her mother when she herself could not be there.

She was a loving, thoughtful and attentive daughter
and Elsie seemed happy in her home. She gave
her the very best of care,

Elsie loved to travel and her children often
included her on trips they took. She recorded an
account of some of these travels in her history:--.
"I have visited numbers of places with members of

_ my family: Mirror Lake with Edith, Heber and

Co., Yellowstone Park with Ellamae and H. D.
Krantz (before they were married), Grand Canyon
with Edith and her husband, little Helen and Mr. &
Mrs. Mark Sabin and daughters - such a happy,
congenial group, and the canyon was so beautiful
and stupendous I was led to exclaim, 'Lo, what
hath God wrought?' Yellowstone Park was also
wonderful in its own way, a scenic diadem in the
midst of a beautiful, natural mountain landscape
with its water fountains, geysers, myriad cascades
and waterfalls. All were breathtaking, but the
sizzling eruptions of steam and hot water from:
the geysers were frightening.

"T had a pleasant trip to California one June,
again withthe Bauers and Heber's brother and
mother, We stopped at Lake Tahoe, which had
the bluest water ILhad ever seen; crossed the
Sierra Nevadas to Sacramento and ferried from
Oakland to San Francisco, The fog here was thick
and cold and we had a hard time finding an apart-
ment that night - everything was cold and wet.

But the sun was bright next morning and we saw
Twin Peaks, the Zoo, Seal Rock, Pasadena, fish
wharves, yacht docks, and in the evening visited
China Town, We left for Yosemite Park, where
the deer were tame as young calves and trees
ages ald. We visited Palo Alto and Stanford Uni-
versity grounds; saw Herbert Hoover's home and
surroundings; had lunch at Mercede; saw 'fire fall'
and the feeding of the bears at Old Village; went to
Mirror Lake, Happy Isle, Alcapetan, around the |
loop to the south entrance and saw the giant Red-
woods, From here we missed a road sign and had
a hot, dusty ride over a cow trail for about fifty
miles, We ate lunch at Fresno and spent the night
at San Fernando, We went through orange groves.
and bought seven dozen oranges for 20¢; went to
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 586

San Diego and got an apartment and then went over
into Mexico (Tijuana and Caliente); then went back
to San Diego and through the Exposition there,
where we did a bit of shopping. Leaving San Diego
we went to Wilmington, then tock a boat to Catalina
Island and rode in a glass-bottom boat. We visited
the Casino, St. Kathrine Hotel, and strolled along
the boardwalk,‘ disgusted with the scant attire of
men and women. Going back to Wilmington by boat,
we started for home. It had been a wonderful and
new experience, Heber, Edith, mother Bauer,
Heber's cousin Dean Carl Bauer, LaPreal and
myself-all took the trip in Heber’ s car and all
returned home safely and well,

In April of 1957 Elsie took another trip with
her daughter Ellamae and husband (H. D, Krantz)
to pick up a grandson, William C. Krantz (Bill)
who had just been released after serving a mission
for the LDS church. Ellamae writes of this:--
"Mother went with us when we went to Mexico to
pick Bill up. The western part of Mexico is rather
isolated from the eastern part, being separated by
the Sierra Madre mountains, Bill was to be offi-
cially released in Monterey and as we had only ten
days we decided to drive the shortest road to
Monterey - from Mazatlan to Durango. It took
from 9 a.m, until midnight and was only 150 miles.
It was a narrow dirt road, actually only used by
trucks for transporting goods, We switched back
and forth to the top of a mountain and then'there
were more mountains as far as the eye could see."
Elsie was just past eighty-two when she took this
strenuous trip but she enjoyed it. Her last long
trip by automobile was when she went with Edith
to spend the Christmas holidays in Texas with

Edith's daughter Helen and family, when she was
eighty - seven,

In her later years Elsie became interested
in genealogy. She took courses in the study of this
subject for which she received certificates, She.
organized and put together a very fine ''Book of
Remembrance" in which she included a history of
herself and Alma, as well as one of each of their
seven children, She also wrote histories of both
her father and mother and of her Danish grandfather,
<span id="page-??"></span>
587 Elsie

Christen Christensen. Genealogy was a subject
the church had begun stressing more and more
during her later years, and being always anxious
to follow the counsels of the church to the best of
her ability, she worked at genealogy during the
rest of her fruitful years. No one could doubt the
love and devotion that Elsie had for the Gospel and
the church throughout all the days of her life.

Iwas fortunate enough to be invited by Edith
to Aunt Elsie's eighty-eighth birthday dinner. She
had been ill but was feeling much better. A. Owen
and Pate were there and Edith's daughter Helen
and her young daughter Helen, as well as Edith
and myself, When I first came into Edith's home,
I stooped to kiss Aunt Elsie and said to her, ''Do
you know who Iam?" 'Why of course', she said,
"Virginia, I shall always know you. Welook so |
much alike, don't you think?!

Finally it became necessary for Elsie to
have more care than Edith was free to give her,
so she was placed for a short time in the Eldred
Hospital in south Provo, where her children could
visit her often. Edith went by plane to Hawaii to
meet her son Boyd, who was enroute from a two
and a half year mission in Taiwan China. The two
had gotten as far as LaPreal's home in California
when word reached them of Elsie's death, 28 June
1964. The death was very sudden and unexpected,
Edgar had visited their mother the night before at
Eldreds and found her in good spirits and in
seemingly good health.

Elsie was eighty-nine years three months and
twenty-one days old when she passed away, the last
of all the Christensens to depart, except two sisters-
in-law - Andrew's wife Sarah, who lived to be
eighty-nine years seven months and fifteen days
and died 23 April 1966 just less than two years
after, and Albert's second wife Myrtle, who is
still living at this writing,

A fine funeral was held in Payson on July lI,
1964, Burial was in the Payson Cemetery and
Elsie was placed there beside Alma. Her six
surviving children were in attendance, Among
others, cousins Pearl and LaFaun and I met with
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 588

the family after all last rites had been spoken, The
Payson home, so long a part of Elsie's life, was
the scene of the meeting, for it had been kept by
the family until this parting. Everywhere I looked
I imagined I could see her, as I had seen her there
so many times before engaged in her labors of love.
I'm sure her spirit was there then, still watching
and praying over her children, as she had always
done as long as she was able.

Alma ''C'' Bartholomew, husband of Elsie,
was born 10 Oct. 1878 at Fayette, Sanpete, Utah,
the fifth of eleven children born to John Bartholomew
and Eliza Roxie Metcalf. Alma was blessed and
named by John Mellor, 10 Nov. 1878; baptized by
his father, Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Nov. 1887;
confirmed the same day by John Mellor; ordained a
Deacon by his father 18 Jan. 1892; ordained a
Teacher in the priesthood by John James, 23 Jan.
1898; ordained a Priest by Joseph Bartholomew
10 Feb. 1901; and ordained an Elder by his father,
23 June 1901; all of the above taking place in
Fayette, The main part of this history of Alma,
which follows, was written by Elsie in her Book
of Remembrance. .

"Alma was reared in a Bishop's home and
taught the gospel by example as well as precept.
His father, Bishop John Bartholomew, was very
devout and consistant in living his religion - it was
'Come, let us go to our meetings and worship the
Lord as all our Father's children should do', Alma
was regular in his attendance at Primary, Sunday
School and Sacrament meetings. He was especially
grateful to his grandmother Polly Benson (Bartholo-
mew), daughter of Benjamin Benson of early Church
history days, who enjoyed so much gathering her
grandchildren around her and telling faith-promoting
stories about the Prophet Joseph Smith and the
trials of the Saints of those early days. She related
how she often sat on the Prophet's knee as a little
girl and told of the love he had for little children.
Alma was so impressed that there came to be no
doubt in his mind but that Joseph Smith was a true
prophet of God. At an early period in his life he
<span id="page-??"></span>
589 Elsie

developed an implicit faith in the power of prayer
and felt that he knew his Heavenly Father would
answer the prayers of those who asked in faith,
He said, ‘In my childish way I prayed about little
things that would have seemed foolish to some but
were a joy to me because I felt that I was being
heard and my little prayers answered, '

"His father was a farmer and a stockman and
did some carpenter work, especially in the winter,
As a young man he had had an accident and had his
right knee thrown out of place, which proved to be
a handicap to him the rest of his life, Alma, being
the oldest boy at home much of the time, had most
of the responsibility and care of the stock, such as
driving them to the range and gathering them in the
fall. He learned to know each by name,''! Alma
tells of some incidents which stood out in his
memory:;-- "In the month of August when I was.
thirteen, another milch cow was needed so it was _
decided that I should go to the summer range and
get 'Olid Spotty' as they were sure she had freshened
by that time. The day I was to go, mother was up
before daylight to prepare my breakfast and lunch,
as it would be a long hard day for me. I was up as
soon as [ heard mother in the kitchen, Father got
Prince, my favorite pony, saddled and a feed of
oats for his lunch securely tied to the saddle.
Father gave me my instructions and mother kissed
me goodby and her last words were, 'God bless
and protect you dear.' I was soon merrily on my
way and in about two hours was in the canyon whe re
the cattle were. As father had directed, I went to
all the water holes - but without success. I stopped
at one of the springs long enough to eat lunch and ©
rest my pony and-feed him his oats. About four
o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I could guess,
Thad been to every place I thought the cow could
be. So I decided I had better start for home if I
expected to be there by dark. Itraveled two or
three miles towards home with a sad feeling,
knowing how unhappy mother would be that I had
failed, I had a feeling that my Heavenly Father
could help me if Il would ask him. So I stopped my
horse and tied him to a tree and went a little
distance down under a pine tree, and prayed for
help. As I finished my humble prayer an impression
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elsie 590

came to me that if I would go back to Maple Spring

I would find Old Spotty there. I had been there
earlier in the day and failed to find her, but I
mounted my pony again anyway and rode back
hurridly about two miles towards Maple Springs.
Before I got to the Spring I saw Old Spotty and it
seemed she was waiting for me. I started her on
the way home and she walked as fast as she could,
but it was dark long before we got out of the canyon.
Mother came to meet me when she heard me coming
and she was so happy for my safe return and accomp-
lishment. When I told her my story she was happier
still, for the goodness of the Lord to me.

"In September that same year my younger
brother and I went with father into the canyon to
get some logs for lumber. It was a long day and
almost dark when we got to our destination, But
father was well acquainted with the canyon and had
a camping place in mind. Wood was plentiful and
my brother and I soon had a large pile gathered and
we soon got a campfire going, hobbled the horses
out and cut some pine boughs to sleep on, After
prayers we were soon in bed and fast asleep. About
midnight the wind began to blow very hard and
father said later that in the midst of his slumbers
it was as if some invisible force had raised him up
by one arm and told him to move quickly, He
grabbed us boys and hustled us some distance then
hurridly rolled up our bedding and moved that and
the grub box and other camping equipment. It
seemed but a moment after everything was out of
danger that a huge dry log came crashing down
across the pine boughs where we had ail been in
peaceful slumber. It would have been death for us
had we not moved. Father often related this cir-
cumstance to show the power of prayer. He never
neglected his prayers no matter where he happened
to be. We got the logs out and to the mill, had
them sawed into lumber and were home by the end
of the week, grateful for the preservation of our
lives.

"When I was ordained a Deacon I soon became
quorum president, '' wrote Alma. ''This gave me an
opportunity to become better acquainted with its
members. I endeavored to do my duty whatever
<span id="page-??"></span>
591 Elsie

the call was, I had many faith promoting exper-
iences in the Aaronic Priesthood. I was ordained
an Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood and not
long afterwards, 26 June 1901, I received my
endowments in the Manti Temple and was married
to Elsie Katherine Christensen by John D. T.
McAilister who was then president of that temple.

"We settled in Fayette for several years
where our first four sons were born. Father and
I farmed together. I sold out my interests there
and purchased a new home from Lafe Bown in
Gunnison in the spring of 1907. At this time I
became interested in the sheep business, This
work took me away from home much of the time
and I became careless in my church duties, I
felt I did not have time to work in the church.
Through this carelessness I became indifferent,
Before long reverses came,!'!

Alma's subsequent separation from his
family has been mentioned in Elsie's history.
Alma was working for the Lindsey Land and Live-
stock Company in southern Utah during this time.
He gave up the sheep business to rejoin his family
in the spring of 1918, They settled in Goshen the
spring of 1920 and Alma farmed there for a couple
of years and then worked for Allen's Market, It
was almost like starting from the beginning.
Finally he got a job working for the Tintic Standard
Mining Co. as 'timber shopman'", The family con-
tinued to live in Goshen until 1931 when they bought
a new home in Payson and moved there, having
rented for those eleven years in Goshen.

Alma eventually got back to working in the
church and moved from one position of trust and
responsibility to another. A chronology of his
church positions after moving to Goshen follows: -
Nov. 1920, called to labor as a local missionary
for Six months in the Tintic Stake of Zion; 30 Nov.
1931 called as 2nd Asst, to Sunday School Superin-
tendent James Mitchell of the Payson Fourth Ward;
1932-1936 served on Scout committee of the Ward
and called to act as its chairman in Nov. 1934;

19 Apr. 1936 set apart as Superintendent of the
Payson Fourth Ward Sunday School; 24 Jan. 1937
set apart as first counselor to Bishop George A.

apart as such 13 Jan, 1952 by Elder Harold B, Lee,

After retiring from working for the mines,
Alma engaged in carpenter work and building
around Payson, He also raised chickens to some
extent, He died 6 Mar. 1954 in the Payson City
Hospital following a major operation. He was
seventy-five years four months and twenty-four
days old at the time. He was buried 9 Mar. 1954
in the Payson City Cemetery, following a beautiful
and well attended memorial service in the Payson
Fourth Ward chapel.

(6) EMMA ELIZA CHRISTENSEN (PETERSON)

Emma was born Sun, 18 July 1877 in the new
home in South Mayfield recently acquired by her
parents, Laurs M. C, and Else K. Christensen,
following their leaving of the United Order experi-
ment on Mayfield's north side. She was the seventh
child and second daughter of the couple, although
the sixth producing branch of their family tree.
When she was nearing two years of age her mother
went to Salt Lake City for six weeks to study medi-
cine, leaving her in charge of her father anda
Sister Anderson who came into the home to assist
with the household and the six children,

Just about the time Emma turned three the
family moved back to Gunnison where they had
lived before Emma was born, This time they
settled in a little adobe home in east Gunnison
belonging to Emma's Uncle, Lars Myrup, but they
spent the next several summers living in
<span id="page-??"></span>
593 Emma

Christenburg, a small farming community midway
between Mayfield and Gunnison, where the father
leased a farm from Julius Christensen (no relation).
In the meantime her father bought a place of his
own in northwest Gunnison on which stood an old
two-roomed adobe house, and here the family took
up their residence in winters for a while - the
family now numbering seven living children and

the parents. In time a new rock house was built

on their property very near to the old house and
both houses were used by the family for a time.
The old two-roomed adobe is long since gone but
the rock house is still standing (1969) on the corner
of Second West and First North in Gunnison. ol

Emma was blessed 4 Oct, 1877 in Mayfield
by Bishop Ole C, Olsen, She was baptized 2 June.
1886 in the Sanpitch River some distance from
their new rock house in Gunnison, by Peter Peter-
son and confirmed the next day, Sun, 3 June 1886
in the church near their home, by C. L. Hansen,
Emma and all of her older brothers and sisters
were re-baptized 1 Apr. 1893, when many of the
Saints in Gunnison rededicated their lives and pur-
poses to the Lord, a

Emma attended the Gunnison District school
which was held not far from her home until she.
graduated from eighth grade, No High School was
then available to her, so she found work inthe .
O, B. Berglund store in Gunnison and worked a
there for some time. Emma was thirteen when
her mother went back to Denmark to see her people
in 1890 and she took a big part in helping to keep
the home running smoothly the three months her
mother was away. In fact, she had been given
responsibilities in the home very early since her _
mother was a medical doctor-nurse in the area
and much in demand outside the home.

Emma's parents encouraged her to continue |
her schooling however, so the winter of 1894/95
she attended the Brigham Young Academy in Provo,
where her older. sister Elsie and most of her older
brothers advanced their educations,»

She attended B, Y. A. until she could qualify
as a school teacher and then taught in Spring City,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Emma 594

Gunnison, and then in Axtell for two winters (1899-
1901). Cousin Lillian J, Peterson remembers that
' Emma lived at their home in Axtell during those
two winters and that the last winter, when she her-
self was five, Emma took her to school with her.
She writes: - 'Cousin Emma was my first school
teacher and I can remember very well that we
walked a mile to school. The first words I wrote
she hugged and kissed me right in the school room;
it seems like it was just yesterday."

After that Emma taught in Fayette, some six
miles north of Gunnison, and likely taught there
two years also, It seems that it was during that
time that she began to be seriously courted by a
young Swede named Charles Peter Peterson of
Gunnison. Emma was a very pretty girl with dark
hair and dark blue eyes, being the only real dark
haired child in the Christensen family. She had
rosy cheeks and a natural high coloring to her fair
skin. She was rather tall in stature and possessed
a sweet, loving, gentle disposition very much like
that of her father; yet she was very "outgoing" like
her mother and so eager to help and please. —

Charles was tall, dark, slender and handsome.
He also had a very gentle and understanding nature,
although he was quite a tease. He and Emma made
a very nice looking couple. Tresia remembers that
"Charlie" courted Emma in a fine one-horse rig
and brought her boxes of chocolates which she
stashed away in her bureau drawer where Tresia
and Vena, like little mice, got into them. But
Charles had one big drawback which loomed high
in Emma's mind, He was not a member of the
church and some of his people were even real bitter
towards it. But real love conquers all. In time
Charles qualified to join the LDS Church and on
Wed. 30 Sept. 1903 he took her in his fancy rig to
the Manti Temple and they were wed, He was
eleven months and two days younger than Emma,
being then twenty-five, while she was twenty-six.
But for nearly one month every late spring they
were of the same age.

Following a wedding party held the night of
their wedding, at her parents' home, Charles took
Emma to live in the home he had on his Bar CC

ir ranch home

<span id="page-??"></span>
595 Emma

ranch, just east of Gunnison, Their son Byron
and his wife Mildred have collaborated on a short
history of Emma's life and from it we now quote:--
"This was the beginning of a busy and eventful life
for Emma, rearing her family and supporting the
activities of an ambitious farmer and stockraiser,
Emma had three children, Byron, Ada and Imelda,
whom she reared to maturity but she lost two little
girls who were stillborn between Ada and Imelda.
Ada remembers how beautiful the one little sister
was as she lay in her box-coffin - like a big doll
asleep, Charles buried each of the little stillborn
babies on their ranch just across the wash from
their house.

"While the menfolks and hired hands were
busily engaged in the fields and on the range,
Emma milked many cows and made and sold pounds
of delicious butter, She hauled barrels of good
water for drinking and carried hundreds of buckets-
ful from the creek for washing and other purposes,
She raised chickens, turkeys, pigs and geese.
Byron says, 'I often remember in my childhood
seeing geese, who had waddled way up onto the
hill above the house, sailing past the kitchen
window as they made a flying landing in the back
dooryard, '

"There is always the fond memory of grandpa
and grandma Christensen coming to our house,
How grandmother enjoyed having mother Emma
brush and comb her hair. It was such a beautiful
head of waist-length auburn hair and she wore it
in braids that were fashioned into a bob on top her
head. Sometimes grandmother would ask if we
had a 'runty pig', referring of course to a baby pig
who wasn't doing so well. Father always seemed
to have a 'runty pig' when grandmother desired
one. She seemed to have a special talent and pride
in getting these little pigs all plumped up and doing
fine in scarcely no time at all.

"Aunt Elvena was a very kind and helpful
sister in Emma's home during her child rearing
years, helping to both care for and 'spoil' Emma's
children, or so Emma said. In later years, after
Vena was married, Emma was able to return the
favors - somewhat. Vena's second child, Alta,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Emma 596

was born at the Peterson home and when the third
child, Tresia, was bornin the farm house on the

Albert Christensen farm west of Gunnison where

Vena and George were living, Emma took care of
little Alta at her home.

"Often, during her leisure hours, Emma
would hitch the horse to the buggy and, taking the
children along, go to visit Vena at the Gunnison
ranch, or Arthur and Millie, Louis and Florence,
Chris and Caroline, or Elsie and Alma, in Gunni-
son and even grandpa and grandma in Manti.

"In 1918 Charles and Emma bought their first
car which was known as the 'Big 4 Overland', One
day enroute to Manti to visit grandfather and grand-
mother Christensen, Charles managed to get the
car up.to the speed of twenty miles per hour, Emma
‘became quite alarmed and was sure he was driving
'too fast’.

"Emma cooked for many hired hands over the
years, due to the customs ofthe day and the various
periods of harvesting of the crops, threshing, etc.
Some-of this help even came from foreign countries
and the isles of the sea. Each of these workers
became somewhat attached to the family and enjoyed
the friendly hospitality of the Peterson home,

"Emma's home was truly a gathering place
for relatives and friends also. Whenever company
came there was feasting, music and singing, games
of all sorts and lots of good old fashioned fun. One
night Emma bedded down thirty-eight relatives in
her home. There is no guarantee just how many
slept but each had a place to lay his or her head...
Byron says, 'I can remember five cousins sleeping
in one bed, three along the top and two across the
bottom, It is just such times as these that are the
most pleasant of all to remember and keep in our
chest of precious memories. I recall mother
insisting on the cousins. performing when they came
to the home. We would always have a program
when our talented cousins came. Aunt Millie's
twins could play the piano and sing; Uncle Andrew's
Edythe, Aunt Elsie's Edith and Ellamae, Uncle
Albert's Virginia and Elaine, and Uncle Lou's
LaFaun, Rose, Alice and Marjorie could all make
<span id="page-??"></span>
597 Emma

the air ring with sweet music, Mother loved music
and could play and sing a bit herself, '

"Emma was born with that rare gift of being
a peacemaker, There wasn't much room for family
squabbles and misunderstandings as far as she was
concerned, Also, she had a very affectionate and
emotional nature. Her eyes would often overflow
with tears of pure joy and appreciation and yet she
would react the same way in her moments of sad-
ness, She and Charles were true examples of pure
love and devotion to each other and to their child-
ren. These same choice virtues she displayed
equally with regard to her beloved father and
mother, as well as to her brothers and sisters and
all others who availed themselves of her generosity.
She was so charitable and sensitive to the needs of
others. And she had a way with people - truly she
was an influence for good among her fellowmen.

"Once Uncle Ben Peterson, Charies' brother,
came to live in their home for a few months. He
had acquired the cigarette habit, which of course
was very distasteful to Emma and Charles and
their family. With tact and being able to say just
the right things at the right time, however, Emma
was influential in giving him the courage and deter-
mination to 'shake!' the dirty habit. He was most
grateful and many were the times in the years which
followed that he sincerely thanked her for this kind-
ness to him,

"Uncle Joseph liked to drop by often on his
way to and from his farm and partake of the proffered
refreshments, And mischievous Uncle Lou, who
delighted in teasing, would come in and help him-
self to any sweetmeats or delicacies that were
available, whether Emma was at home or not, At
her return from the garden or field he would pre-
tend to be extra hungry and when she would go to
serve him a piece of pie or what-not, she would
find to her amazement tht her 'cupboard was
bare', so to speak, since Lou had already devoured
the 'treat' ahead of time, Her brother Louis would
have his little joke! _

"Passers-by and even hoboes dropped in
many times at her gate requesting 'hand outs',
<span id="page-??"></span>
Emma 598

Some said her's was a 'marked place’. She asked
a hobo who called one day if this was so and how
her place was 'marked'. 'This', he said, 'I cannot
reveal - but it is true',

"Emma was not only kind to people and even
strangers but she was kind to animals. She became
very attached to the cows, pigs and horses on their
ranch, At one time her brother Albert was in need
of a good milch cow for the foreman of his Gunnison
ranch and asked Charles to sell himone. Charles
consented. When the foreman came to take ‘old
Bossy' away, Emma was intears. And she wept
for quite a while afterwards, as if she really loved
that old cow. She was very tender hearted when it
came to their animals. The animals on the farm
seemed to reciprocate.

"Emma was active in all of the auxiliaries of
the church at one time or another, being most
prominent in the MIA. Inthe YLMIA organization
she served as a counselor in the Ward and later as
president. She was a Relief Society teacher and
then served as first counselor to the ward Relief
Society president, Mrs, Hyrum Fredrickson, and
later as second counselor to President Lena Madsen
in the same organization. Before such occasions
as Thanksgivings, Christmases, after bazaars,
etc., it became her duty and privilege to take her
horse and buggy and help deliver the gifts of food
and kind remembrances to the worthy families of
her particular ward. Many have testified that she
was indeed a virtuous and noble woman. This was
indeed a great heritage to leave to her children and
grandchildren.

"Mainly she lived a life of joy and happiness
and her labors were labors of love. She made ita
point to go with her family for at least two visits to
Wyoming while Aunt Elsie, Uncle Lou, Aunt Vena
and families and some of Uncle Chris! family lived
on the ranch at 'The Oasis'. Later, when Elsie
and Vena and families moved to Goshen, Emma
made numerous visits to them there. She spoke
in most endearing terms of her brothers and sisters
and loved ones - it was always ‘dear sister Elsie
or Vena; dear brother Chris, Andrew, Joseph,
Albert, Louis or Arthur; dear father, dear mother,
<span id="page-??"></span>

or dear cousin this or that. One had only to know
her to love her."

Byron says, ''One of mother's happiest
Christmases was when she awoke on Christmas
morning to find nothing in her stocking except a
can each of corn, peas and beans. Her disappoint-
ment was more than she could bear and she burst
into tears. Dad quietly slipped out of the room and
up the stairs and with some assistance carried down
and presented to her Santa's real gifts - the most
beautiful carpet and set of dishes she had ever
owned, Tears mingled with cries of joy and laugh-
ter brought a very dramatic climax to her Christ-
mas that year.''!

"Emma was normally slender but she developed
a diabetic condition and became rather heavy in
middle age. She was a striking woman, however,
with her dark heavy hair, rosy cheeks and high
coloring. She had a rather low-pitched speaking
voice which seemed to caress as it spoke, She
had a gentle, humble, sweet way about her and
was very tolerant and patient, and in this she was
much like her father, but she was much like her
mother in her love for humanity and the living
things of the earth. She was most devoted to
family, friends, the less fortunate and the church -
and to her Heavenly Father.

"In 1926 she took into her home the two
motherless children of Lindon H. Johnson, Dale
and Ramona. She promised to care for them for
a period of two weeks, but became so attached to
them she asked tobe allowed to keep them a whole
year. At a later date these two children became
her grandchildren by adoption when her oldest
daughter Ada became the second wife of Mr. John-
son. But Emma did not live to see or know this -
nor did she live to see any of her very own grand-
children,"'!

Imelda, Emma's youngest child, writes of
her: 'Mother must have been a wonderful teacher,
I remember so many of her early students, when
they were older, telling of what an outstanding
teacher she had been to them. She was also a
great Relief Society worker, After the horse-and-

buggy days, when we children were older, we often
took her to her meetings in the car and waited to
drive her home, She never did learn to drive the
car, I can also remember how often we had Sunday
guests and Conference visitors, My, the crowds
were always with us. Wish I knew how to handle
guests with the grace and efficiency mother did,
Those were great years! Now we seem to have so
many more conveniences but our lives aren't as
abundant. Mother had few of the things we think

of as necessities and take for granted now, but her
life was rich and abundant in the joy of service,
love and friendship - in the real values of life."

Byron and Mildred continue: ''On her fiftieth
birthday, 8 July 1927, electricity was turned on in
Emma's home for the first time. Before that they
had used candles, kerosene or oil lamps for light-
ing. Emma was only privileged to enjoy this
luxury for the short period of about two months,
During her later years the city water was piped to
her kitchen from town, a mile away, and she had
runhing water in the house for the first time.

‘In August of 1927 their daughter Ada and
Mr. Lindon Johnson, who were then keeping com-
pany, suggested that Emma and Charles share a
ten-day vacation trip with them to the colorful
canyons of southern Utah. They had a wonderful
trip together, But on their return, Emma didn't
feel so well and she grew rapidly worse, In spite
of all the special nursing and loving care that was
showered upon her, it became evident that she
could not survive this last diabetic illness, She
passed away at her home on the ranch east of Gunni-
son, 4 Sept, 1927.'' It was autumn, her favorite
season of the year, She was buried 7 Sept. 1927
in the Gunnison cemetery following a well attended,
beautiful funeral service worthy of such a lovely
lady.

Ada, gentle and sympathetic in nature like
Emma, was at her mother's bedside almost con-
stantly during this serious and final illness. She
pled with her not to leave them, Ada has operated
rest homes for elderly ladies for many years now,
and in speaking of this she says she never helps an
old lady to her rest at nights without thinking of her

Charles Peter Peterson, husband of Emma
Eliza Christensen, was born in Brunflo, Sweden,
10 June 1878, a son of Marten Gronvell Peterson
and Barbru (Barbara) Pahlson Peterson,

Charles left Sweden for the United States.
2 Aug. 1879, when he was about fourteen months
old, in company with his parents, Marten and
Barbara Peterson, two half brothers, John and
Peter (sons of his father by a former marriage),
a sister Marta and a brother Paules; Charles of
course being the youngest, They settled in Gunni-
son, Sanpete, Utah among other Scandinavians,
some of whom they may have known. They were
not members ofthe L.D.S, Church but came to -
Zion to better their living conditions.

Charles' father was a shoemaker by trade
and the 1880 census taken in Gunnison the summer
of that year bears this out. It lists the family as —
follows: ''Marten Peterson, age 45, male, married,
occupation shoemaker, born in Sweden; Barbara
Peterson, age 33, female, married, keeping house,
born in Sweden; Peter, age 18, male, single, son
of Marten, works on farm, born in Sweden; John,
age 16, male, single, son of Marten, apprentice ©
(likely to his father) born in Sweden; Marta age 6, ©
female, single, daughter of Marten, born in
Sweden; Paulus age 4, male, single, son of Marten,
born in Sweden; Charies Peter age 2, male, single,
son of Marten, born in Sweden, '!

Five other sons were born to this Peterson
family after they moved to Gunnison, They were
a thrifty, energetic group. The oldest son, Peter,
became a shoemaker, like his father; two of the
other boys became farmers, and the rest were
businessmen of some sort, John at one time was
Mayor of Gunnison,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Emma 602

Charles attended the public schools of Gunni-
son and graduated from the eighth grade, He had
decided te attend B. Y. A, in Provo, when he was
offered a job he felt he could not afford to turn down.
Imelda writes of this: 'A Mr. Bown offered Daddy
a high salary if he would take over some of his herds
of sheep; in fact, the price was above average and
too attractive for those days and he went on the job,
We often felt like scolding Mr. Bown when we were
older, for our Daddy would have been a real mathe-
matics major - or so we thought. He was always
measuring hay and could tell measurements of size,
weight and acreage, etc., so easily, although his
book learning was so little."'

Charles must have done all right with Mr.
Bown's sheep, for before he was twenty-five years
old he had a large farm with a nice two-story house
on it, some stock and equipment and a fine driving
horse and rig of his own, all paid for. He was
prepared to take a wife and ready and able to
support a family. But he was having a little diffi-
culty in this respect, for the girl he had chosen
had made some rather stringent demands of him,
before she would become his bride.

It seems that none of Charles' people were
members of the L.D.S, Church - nor was he, The
girl he had his eyes on, Emma Christensen, refused
to marry him unless he could take her to the L.D.S5S.
Temple for the ceremony. This must have seemed
difficult for a young man of his age, but he set about
to try to qualify himself to become a member of the
church in which she was affiliated. He succeeded,
however, and was baptized into the L,D.S, Church
30 May 1903, just eleven days prior to his twenty-
fifth birthday.

Charles courted Emma in his one seated rig
drawn by his fine horse, and it was in this outfit
that he took her to the beautiful Manti Temple, 30
Sept. 1903, to be married, thus fulfilling their
dream of several years, He took her home to live
on his ranch about one mile east. of Gunnison and it
was here she lived the remainder of her days, and
here that each of their three children, one son and
two daughters, were born. It was here also that
two little stillborn daughters came to them and
<span id="page-??"></span>

Charles made little box coffins for each and buried
each in turn himself across the wash from the house
on their own place.

The ranch itself supported the family very
nicely with the cows, chickens, ducks and other
barnyard animals they raised there. Charles fed
lots of stock, including as many as fifty pigs at a
time. Byron tells that when he used to get angry
at his father he would go down to the pigpen and
threw rocks at the pigs to make them squeal,
Nevertheless, the son Byron learned to be a big
help to Charles on the ranch, and as he grew to
manhood worked side by side with his father,

Charles was very good to Emma's parents -
he couldn't do too much for them, He often gave
Laurs employment on his ranch and paid him well.
Else liked to help thin beets and harvest potatoes
for him, and when she did he paid her too, Often
he gave them a ''runty pig'| a lamb, a cow ora
few laying hens. They were always more than
welcome at his home and he at theirs, for he was
more like a son to them than a son-in-law.

Following the death of his beloved wife Emma,
4 Sept. 1927, Charles and his three children got
along by themselves until Ada was married and
moved away. Thenon 31 Dec. 1929 Charles mar-
ried a Danish widow, Minda Peterson of Redmond,
who had several children of her own. She stayed
on in Redmond and Charles lived there with her
but continued to help Byron operate the ranch and
spent lots of time with him and Imelda.

The middle of March 1930 Charles sent
Byron on a mission to South Africa and had Emma's
niece, Vera Clark, come to be company for Imelda.
Vera writes;-- ''I had been staying at Uncle Charles!
with Imelda that summer of 1930, so I stayed right
on that winter and took my 7th grade work in
Gunnison, I have fond memories of that year.
Byron was on his mission and Ada lived in Delta,
We visited Ada and family several times during
the year. Uncle Charles was so good to me!"

After several years Charles' wife, Minda,
was stricken with brain cancer and rushed to a
Salt Lake hospital for treatment, Charles took
<span id="page-??"></span>

his turn with her children watching by her bed of
suffering but she soon died and he returned to live
at his ranch home,

He was a fine gentleman and very good to
everyone, especially Emma's sister Vena and her
large family. How often I remember Charles and
Byron driving up in his large truck to a Christensen
family reunion, with a number of George's and
Vena's children aboard. They would come from
Gunnison around by way of Goshen or Santaquin to
bring them. Charles was so pleasant and jovial
and always took part in the games and other activi-
ties at these reunions with seeming relish. He was
usually among the first to arrive and the last to
leave, bringing a spirit of good will and brother-
hood along with him. I remember him as slender,
tall, dark, good looking and oh so friendly. He did
not push himself forward but was always there to
do his part and more, He had excellent health, was
a hard worker, honest and clean living, and had a
ruddy glow about him that one could not help but
admire.

From the time of his baptism Charles was
consistant and faithful in his efforts in behalf of
the church, in spite of the fact that some of his
own people were downright bitter towards that
organization and made things uncomfortable, if
not difficult for him. Among other responsibilities,
he served as Counselor inthe M,I1.A., an officer
in the Seventies Quorum, and a member of the
Hamilton Ward bishopric in Gunnison for many
years, Soon after Byron returned from his mission,
having no more sons to send, he sent his daughter
Imelda on a Canadian mission, June 1934. He held
the office of High Priest in his later years. No one
could question his love for the gospel and the
church, Cousin Florence C, Hougaard remembers
speaking to him in the Manti Temple on one occa-
sion, at which time Charles remarked to her that
his life since he had become active in the church
was like ''Heaven on earth,"

When Byron married in 1936 and brought his
wife Mildred home to the ranch house to live,
Charles stayed on as a most welcome part of the
family. Though he had his own room upstairs and

could come and go at will, he chose to enter into
the family's activities. As the grandchildren came
along they learned to adore him. Byron's oldest,
Barta, tells of how thrilled she was to dance with
her grandfather at a Relief Society bazaar one time
when she was about seven, Charles loved to dance
and was corisidered to be an excellent dancer.

On 14 May 1945 Charles married Mrs, Lydia
Adair and moved out of the ranch house for the first
time since he had brought his bride Emma there to
live some forty-one and a half years before. He
and Byron continued to operate the ranch together
and have most of their other activities together as
well. About four months later, however, Byron
was stricken with polio and rushed to the General
Hospital in Salt Lake City for treatment. He
would never walk again!

Charles looked after Mildred and her. five
little ones, including a two months old baby, and
_ kept in close touch with Byron in the hospital as
well, On 8 Oct. 1945, three weeks after Byron...
was stricken, Mildred had invited Charles and...
Lydia to come to the ranch for supper. But :
Charles never got there. Right after a good lunch
that noon, one of his calves got loose and he took
off after it. Without warning he was stricken with
a heart attack. He died with his beets on-emroute
to the hospital. end ;

Of all the times when it seemed that Charles
was needed most on earth, this was the time. ~ But
‘he was called to serve elsewhere and! others were
left to.solve the earthly problems. His two daugh-
ters, Ada and Imelda, came to help with burial »
arrangements. It was six days after his death
before this took place, 14 Oct.) 1945, He was laid
away beside his beloved wife Emma in the Gunni-
son Cemetery. A copy ofthe remarks given at
his funeral service was made and sent to Byron
in the Salt Lake hospital. :

Louis 606

(7) LOUIS "'D'! CHRISTENSEN

Louis, or ''Lou", eighth child, fifth son and
seventh producing branch of the Laurs and Else K,
Christensen family, was born 20 Mar. 1880 in May-
field, Sanpete, Utah. He was christened Lars Peter
Christensen 1 June 1880 by Bishop Ole C, Olsen of
Mayfield. Soon the name Lars was changed to Louis
and in early manhood the middle name Peter was
discarded in favor of the initial 'D'. For atime
Louis also changed the ending of his surname from
sen to son, as some of his older brothers had done,
but he eventually went back to the original Danish
spelling of Christensen, which all of his descendants
now use.

When Louis was but a few months old his father
sold the home in South Mayfield and moved his family
into east Gunnison where they lived for a time ina
small adobe house owned by his brother-in-law, Lars
Myrup. Then his father purchased a large lot in
northwest Gunnison, on which stood a small adobe
house of two rooms, and into this the family of nine
moved and lived in winters so that the older children
could attend school. In summers for the next four
or five years, however, the family lived mostly on
a farm in north Christenburg, midway between
Mayfield and Gunnison, which their father had leased
from a well-to-do land and stock owner by the name
of Julius H. Christensen (no relation). It was here
on this farm, with lots of room to roam, that young
Louis spent many of his early days. It was while
living here on the farm in Christenburg, when he
was just under five years old, that he suffered the
severe injury to the four fingers of his right hand,
which were so badly burned to the knuckles that
they could not be saved. It was only through the
faith and prayers of members of his family and the
never-ending work and care of his doctor-nurse
mother, Else K., that the hand proper was pre-
served. Even then this seemed like a miracle.

More details have been given about this accident
earlier in the book. . Though knobs finally grew on
the stumps of his maimed hand, where the fingers
had been, and though Louis later learned to use this
<span id="page-??"></span>
607 Louis

crippled right hand with great dexterity, it is
understandable that this must have been a source
of embarrassment and concern to the youngster
when he was ready to enter school.

A new rock house was soon erected near the
old adobe one on the family lot in northwest Gunni-
son and into this the family had settled themselves
by the time Louis was ready for school, He finished
the eighth grade in the public schools of Gunnison
but it is doubtful that he continued his formal educa-
tion beyond that. At one time he jokingly told his
children that his folks managed to get him up to
Provo, hoping to enroll him at B. Y.A., but that
he climbed through an upstairs window of their
living quarters into a tree and got away -- Louis
was a great joker! Yet it was true he got no
college education.

He was baptized in the Sanpitch River, some
distance from their home in Gunnison, 1 Aug. 1888,
by Bishop A. C. Madsen and confirmed next day in
church, 2 Aug. 1888, by Thomas Wasden. He was
ordained a Deacon 7 May 1893, according to the
early Gunnison Ward records, Louis loved music
and he had a rich, deep voice. He and his younger
brother Arthur used to sing in the ward choir,
according to their foster sister, Tresia.

Louis grew to be the tallest and largest of |
the Christensen family, which was made up of good
sized people, both men and women. A great lot of
Danish soup and dumplings must have gone into his
making. He inherited a beautiful head of blonde,
curly hair, He was husky, strong and vigorous in
his youth and full of fun. He loved to play pranks
in which he often involved his younger brother
Arthur, When Arthur began courting, these jokes
and pranks proved to be most annoying to his sweet-
heart, Millie, who was pretty sure Lou was leading
Arthur "astray", Their youngest sister, Elvena,
was often the victim of these pranks and jokes,
being so utterly without guile and trusting like
she was.

When the Spanish blew up the Maine and the
Spanish-American War was declared in early 1898,
a number of young men from Gunnison volunteered
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 608

at the first call for troops in Battery C, U.V.A.,
and Louis was among them. The boys were given
quite a ''send off'' as they left Gunnison depot by
train in early July. But when Louis reached Salt
Lake City he was told that the complement was
filled and was sent home, This was a great
disappointment to him and he strongly felt that he
was rejected because of his maimed hand, although
he was a much better shot with a gun than most of
his friends and associates. He was always very
sensitive about that crippled hand.

There was plenty of work for all at the Chris-
tensen place, with chickens, ducks, pigs, cows to
milk, horses and a large vegetable garden and
lucerne patch, not to mention the 140 acre farm
his father bought which had to be cleared of grease-
wood, as well as the other land he operated, But
as soon as Louis was old enough to be trusted out
with the sheep he was given a job by his brother
C. I. and worked several years as one of his |
herders.

Louis was ordained an Elder 3 Feb. 1901 and
it was anticipated that he would be soon called to
serve a mission for the church. However, on
March 6 1901 he took Miss Sarah Florence Mellor
to the Manti Temple where they had their endow-
ments and were sealed in marriage for time and
eternity.. This was on a Wednesday and just two

weeks before his twenty-first birthday. Florence,
who. was from Fayette, was a few months short of
her twenty-second birthday. He was large, with
curly blond hair and blue eyes, She was dainty and
small with dark hair and big brown eyes. Since.
Florence's mother had been long dead, Laurs and
Else held a wedding party at their home in Gunnison
the evening of the marriage, at which a fine wedding
supper was served. .

Louis and Florence went to live in the old
Mellor home in Fayette where Florence had lived
and cared for her younger sisters and brothers
since her mother had passed away before she was
fourteen... Three months after they were married,
Louis received his expected mission call. He was
to serve in the Western States Mission. He was
set apart for this 11 June 1901, and left soon

afterwards to labor in Colorado. However, due to
the serious illness of his wife, who was expecting
their first child, he was soon called home and
given an honorable release in order to help take
care of her. Florence began to mend and their
little daughter, Florence LaFaun, arrived safely
and well, 12 Dec, 1901 in Fayette.

Within a short time Louis had made arrange-
ments to move his family to Gunnison. His brother
Arthur, ina letter to his sweetheart Millie, dated
17 Feb. 1902, stated: 'Louis bought John Wasden's
place so I guess he will be my neighbor now.'! The
John Wasden place was across the road south and
a few doors to the east of Laurs' and Else's home
in northwest Gunnison, and here is where Louis:
and his family settled for the next few years. This
must have been a wise thing to do since Louis was
working for his brother Chris at the time and gone
so much with the sheep. His parents could look
out for his little family.

Louis worked for several years as a herder
for his brother C, I. and was for a time in charge
of the sheep grazing territory in Twelve Mile Can-

“yon and surrounding grazing areas, Then in about
1907 he took over operation ofa ranch by the Sevier
River, west of Gunnison, which his brother Albert
had purchased, and moved his family, now enlarged
by the addition of two sons, into the poorly equipped
farm house that place afforded, Rex was the baby
then and rather sickly. Florence had many worries
being so far away from a doctor with him. )

In the meantime Arthur had married and had
gone into the sheep business with Albert and-Louis
worked for them with the sheep when he was _ not
tied with the ranch, which he managed for a couple
of years, He and Arthur took care of the herds: on
the west desert during the winters.

The first of the year 1909 Louis' parents
decided to move to Manti where they could be near
the temple. They were also planning a trip back
to Old Denmark to see their relatives and search
out more of their genealogy. They suggested that
Louis buy their home in Gunnison. After having
had the sad experience of losing their fourth child,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 610

a baby son Spencer, in May of 1908, Louis and
Florence must have been grateful for the opportunity
to move into the comfortable rock house in which
Louis had grown to manhood, and accepted eagerly.
The old Gunnison Ward records list Laurs and Else
Christensen's membership as having been trans-
ferred from Gunnison to Manti in early February
1909, so it must have been about that time that
Louis moved his family into the old home. It was
here their next three children were born,

Louis continued to work with Arthur with the
sheep, wintering on the.west desert and in Twelve
Mile Canyon for the summer months, They lambed
their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina. It was
on Cedar Mt. that Louis was taken seriously ill,
Arthur's brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill, tells of
this: "Iwas with Lou on Cedar Mt, when he had a

stroke. I rode to Gunnison that night for help and
Lou was taken to town. Jake Sorensen from Manti
came down with us. If I remember correctly this
was in July 1910. Louis had become very heavy
and had high blood pressure. He was ill for quite
a while after that." —

Arthur and Albert turned their sheep i into the
Bennion Livestock Company later that same sum-
mer, and they. were driven up into the Weber River
area-in northeastern Utah, where their brother
Chris then had his interests in connection with the
Bennion Livestock Company, of which he was co-
owner and general manager. Back on his feet |
again, Louis was given employment by his brother
Chris with the same company. December 1913
found him with a herd of sheep near Lyman, Wyo-
ming, which area was to play so great a part in the
remainder of his life. He took up 640 acres of
homestead land not far from Lyman in January
1915, close to some property owned by his brother
Chris, His sister Elsie Bartholomew homesteaded
some land near his at the same time, as did his
brother Chris' oldest daughter Pearl. Later his
brother Andrew and his sister Elvena also took up
some land in the same vicinity and the entire acre-
age owned by the Christensens came to be known
by them as ''The Oasis",

Louis moved his family from Gunnison to
<span id="page-??"></span>
6il Louis

Wyoming in March of 1916. He then had six living
children, the youngest and second daughter, Alice,
being less than two years old, His sister Elsie
took her five children and moved to Wyoming at
the same time. The night before they left Gunni-
son they all stayed at their sister Emma's, who
lived but a mile from the Gunnison depot, from
which they all left by train the next morning, 27
Mar. 1916. Both families lived in two rooms of
the four-roomed cabin that Chris had built on his
place on The Oasis until cabins could be built on
their property. This was the first project to be
attempted that spring and soon Louis and his
family and Elsie and hers were housed in their
own log and frame cabins on the Wyoming ranch.

The story of the next few years in Wyoming
was like something out of a Western movie mystery
and as full of intrigue. Desperados tried to force
the Christensens off their land by stealing their
stock, burning their crops and setting fire to their
homes; during which time the beloved brother Chris
became an innocent victim of this range war and
died 5 Oct. 1917. The story of those nerve-
wracking years has been told in detail in an earlier
chapter of this history, titled ''Wyoming Interlude".
Eventually all of the Christensens sold out their
holdings on The Oasis or let them go for taxes,
except Louis, who chose to remain in the area
and ''face the music''as it were. He moved his
family into Lyman where, having been deputized
at the time of all the trouble on his ranch, he
became active in the law enforcement of the region.
He bought out the property of his deceased brother
Chris on The Oasis and his holdings there then
totaled some 882 acres and the four roomed cabin
built by Chris, which his family used from time to
time. He continued to farm on the ranch, in be-
tween his duties as deputy sheriff; it was a good
place to keep his boys busy.

Life was not easy for Louis or his family
that winter following Chris' death. Rumors about
the burning of the crops and the killing and other
outrages on the ranch were flying thick and fast.
Some people were friendly to the Christensens and

private detective who had been hired to investigate
the trouble and came out for six months, with his
traps, clamps, guns, saddles and other gear,
masquerading as a trapper, was busy at his work
and sometimes stirring up more trouble for the
Christensens than help, it seemed. Known as
Operative #209 this Mr. Davis set up and serviced
his traps and then appeared to loiter in saloons,
stores, sheep camps, ranches, town dances or
any place he could secretly take the pulse of public
or private opinion. He operated mainly in the
areas of the mostly Mormon community of Lyman
and the somewhat anti-Mormon one of Mountain
View, some miles apart in Uinta County in the
Bridger Basin of Wyoming. He sent in his reports
to his superiors weekly, and abstracts from a few
of these give an indication of the opinions he was
able to glean: (For obvious reasons only initials
are used here for most names. )

"Jan. 1, 1918 - Opr. finds that there is a
great deal of talk right now about the Christensen
burnings, It seems that everybody has the same
opinion and one and all connect the name ''H'' with
the burnings, There was an article inthe Bridger
Valley Enterprize recently giving a list of people
who had contributed towards a fund for Mr. Chris-
tensen that he might rebuild his home again, and
you can be sure none of the ''H'" gangs names were
there, though the petition was said to have been
presented to them. . . I rode over from Lyman
south to Smith Fork and set up a few traps, then
rode over towards Mountain View where Mr. 'H'
lives. I stayed overnight at the ranch of a Mr. 'R'
who referred to the Christensen fires and said that
'The Black Hand! had burned Mr, Christensen's
house twice and caused the shooting of Mr. Chris-
tensen's brother. He seemed to think it was an
outrage and about time the authorities were doing
something about it. I asked him if he had any idea
who would do such a dastardly trick. He said no
one seemed to know positively but that the Chris-
tensens had taken up a good deai of government
land formerly used by Mr. 'H' as a lambing ground
and that a great many people in the county were of
the opinion that 'H' is the man who is responsible
for the fires. . . All the interviews I have had with
<span id="page-??"></span>

people here so far, they all seem to think very
well of Mr. Christensen but hold a contrary opinion
of Mr. 'H'. People say that 'H' has a fine wife but
that he is a regular would-be outlaw, that he car-
ries a gun with him continually, and that his boy

is as toughas he is. Taking everything into con-
sideration, Opr. is firmly of the opinion that Mr.
'H' is the brains of a pretty bad gang here and
everything would indicate that this gang did the
Christensen burnings,"

Operative was anxious to get closer to that
"H'" gang but made no headway until he hit upon a
certain plan. It had been reported to him that Mr.
"H'' had been circulating the rumor that Opr. was
a German spy. The general talk was that it was
very necessary to be on the lookout for spies, for
it would be easy for anyone to go up in the moun-
tains and put poison in the creeks which would in
turn poison all the stock and people. Following
his new plan, in a conspiracy with the Uinta
County officials, Opr. #209 had himself arrested
as a suspected spy and was taken into custody by
Deputy Sheriff L. D. Christensen. The Bridger
Valley Enterprize carried the news under the head-
ing "Arrested as a German Spy Suspect" and it
read thus; ''On complaint of Mayor C. G. Young-
berg of Lyman District Attorney Matthews author-
ized the arrest of R. L., Davis as a possible German
spy. Davis entered the Bridger Valley a few weeks
ago aS atrapper, but his actions and pro-German
statements made Lyman and Mountain View residents
suspect him of being an undesirable character.
Sunday night the County officers went to Davis'
cabin ad searched it but aside from finding five
revolvers of the best make and 1500 rounds of
ammunition, no incriminating evidence was found.
He was arrested on Monday morning and taken as
a prisoner to Evanston and turned over to the Fed-
eral authorities for further investigation, which
may result in his being interned for the duration
of the war at one of the prison camps,"

Of course Opr. was soon released and went
right away to Mountain View, telling all he met
there what a "dirty deal'' he had been dealt by
Christensen and the people of Lyman. His plan
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 614

worked beautifully, for soon most of the ''H" gang
warmed up to him and even went so far as to invite
him to pull his traps in the Lyman and Smith Fork
‘areas and put them iround the 'H' herds, which
he did. Although Mr. 'H' himself was very wary,
his son soon accepted Opr. as a close associate.
and soon these two were spending much time .
together at the sheep camp where the younger 'H"!
seemed to be "hiding out''. Here Opr., from time
to time, was able to observe at close hand many
little things that led him to believe that the right
gang was suspected. For example, there was the
time that he accidently ran across the 'H' son and
-his camp tender skating up the canal to opposite
the Christensen place, and when he asked them
why, they laughed and said they were going to trap
muskrats there - "the big kind!'' Opr. figured if
he hung around there it would just be a matter of
time until conclusive evidence could be secured
or until some other crimes were attempted.

Then there were the inflamatory statements
that the 'H' son made, suchas: "If lever shoot at
Christensen at fifty yards it won't be through his
_,coat but through his body. . . If Christensen ever
does find out who burned his place, I'm going to
him with two six-shooters and hold one on him |
while I hit him on the head with the other, and if
he moves I will plug-him. . . Besides, Christensen
-comes out every few days with a new story, some-
times accusing the cattlemen, then me, then some-
body else. ... . They haven't got proof that I done
the burning and cannot convict me of it. If they
arrest me they had better convict me, for if they
don't Dad will break Christensen". The 'H' son
also said from time to time that he believed L. D.
Christensen set the fires himself and he told var-
ious stories about where he was the nights of the
burnings but none of them jibed. He also said that
his father was waiting until some of the homesteaders
round about got starved out or disgusted with home-~-
steading and then he'd buy them out cheap.

In his report at the end of February, Opr.
#209 included these statements: ". , . The people
around Lyman have made sore open remarks to
the effect that if the guilty parties are arrested
<span id="page-??"></span>
615 Louis
they should be lynched; and Opr. is of the opinion
that all of this is not idle talk and for that reason
suggests that proper care be taken in making
arrests, Opr. is also of the,opinion that if the
arrests are made, the younger 'H' will break down
under some rapid questioning. "

On Mar. 5th, after some careful arranging,
Mr. "'H'', his son, his camp tender and Opr. #209
were arrested and taken by train from Carter to
Evanston where they were lodged in the county jail.
The next day Opr. was released and went on with
his work, while the other three were kept until the
10th and then let out on bail. Mr. 'H!' said at the
time that he didn't think the authorities had anything
definite enough on him to be a serious threat, but
let them try to convict him he had plenty of money
to protect himself with. But he was careful enough
to watch his Ps and Qs for awhile, for he knew his
every move was being watched somehow,

So the Christensen case stood while the...
investigation went on into April and May. And
though the general feeling towards the 'H' gang
seemed to be getting worse all the time, new con-
flicting rumors appeared that seemed to point in
another direction. For example, it now seemed
that the case might be bigger than ever and the |
work of a Mr. ''K'! adaMr, ''M' and others of
their associates who, it was whispered, had
planned to get Mr. '"'H'" in bad and in this way
force him to sell out to Mr, 'K', Thus, if they
could get Mr. 'H" and his crowd out of the country
they would then finish Christensen and his relatives
by fire and force them out also. Then the range
would be open for them all the way to Lyman, and
if Mr. ''K" bought out the ''H' home ranch it would
make a good pen ground for their cattle and in that
way there would be nothing to prevent them ranging
where they would, with pens on either end for
feeding. It sounded plausible.

A criminal lawyer came out from Salt Lake
City and took testimony after testimony under oath,
with the assistance of Operative #209. But as has
been told in a former chapter, the case never came
to trial, the investigator was dismissed and the
affair finally dropped. Perhaps none were more

relieved to have this episode in their lives die a
natural death at last than the Christensens,

Louis was elected Uinta County Sheriff
beginning with the election of Nov. 1918, for four
two-year terms, He moved his family of ten into
the ''sheriff's house" in Evanston, Wyoming. He
failed to serve his fourth term as county sheriff
however, as he was appointed Wyoming State
Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Gov. Nellie
Taylor Ross, first woman governor in the United
States in the early part of 1925, So he moved his
family to Cheyenne, Wyoming, which was the State
Capitol, and had his office suite in the capitol
building there.

The Christensen family lived in Cheyenne for
two years and then returned to live in a nice home
in Evanston, Wyoming and Louis continued to serve
in law enforcement on a city level. He served in
law enforcement in Wyoming at some level or
another for nearly thirty years. He was a valuable
man in that field. Many criminals crossed his path
during those years. His daughter Rose, telling of
this, writes: '''Louis was a big man' his Bishop
said of Dad, ‘with a heart to match', and I agree.
Bishop Rawlins also said of father, 'There was no
one more persistent in tracking down and bringing
criminals to justice; yet no one kinder to those he
had captured'; and with this I also agree,'!

Oil was being found in the area about this time
and Louis decided he would look for oil on his ranch.
A rig was set up and men started to drill on the
place. His son Weldon tells of an incident that
happened during the drilling: '"I guess one of the
most exciting things that ever happened to me was
the time the big steam boiler blew up on our ranch
six miles east of Lyman. Some oil people were
drilling for oil on our place, This particular day
some drillers were trying to pull some casing or
pipe out of the hole they were drilling. After
trying and trying, without success, they decided
to dynamite it out by sending a homemade bomb on
the end of a cable a thousand or so feet down into
the hole in hopes of breaking the casing in two and

loosing the pipe. The cable was attached to the end
of the steam boiler, Several tries were made to

brother Albert in
Lyman, Wyoming

<span id="page-??"></span>
617 Louis

pull the pipe up with this method, sending down

the bombs and then trying another pull on the
casing with the rig and steam machine. The bombs
were. lit on top of the ground and then some of the
men had to hold the pipe very steady with pipe
wrenches while others screwed the top on the bomb
to make it water-tight. There were eight sticks of
dynamite in each of these bombs, and as each one
would hit the bottom and go off it would send up
water and cable into the air for many feet. During
this dangerous work the drillers were trying to

get more steam out of the old boiler so it could
pull harder, although it already showed 180 lbs.

on the guage.

"Dad and I, who had been watching this
operation, decided to go down to the lower ranch
to get a small load of hay. The drillers were still
trying for more steam when we returned. We tied
our team up near the barn and walked over to the
steam boiler to try and get our hands and feet
warm, as it was mid-winter and terribly cold.
Dad went into the little 'doghouse' first, took off
his overboots and put his feet up to warm them.
He was sitting on a couple of barrels of new oil
that were parked in front of the boiler. He called
to me, 'Come on in - it's nice and warm in here’,
I don't know why, but I had stopped just outside.
the 'doghouse' door and when Dad called to me,
all of a sudden I had a very clear warning or
impression that we were to get out of there fast.
I yelled back to Dad, 'Come back out and let's
go quick!' He looked at me a second and said,
'OK son, let's go then'. He didn't even put his _
shoes back on - just picked them up, came out
and walked quickly with me to the oil rig in his ©
stocking feet. As we entered the rig-house the
driller laughed at him and asked him why the such-
and-such he was running around in his stocking
feet. Dad answered that he believed in 'hunches'
and when he had seen the look on my face as I |
yelled at him to get out of the 'doghouse', he had
a hunch he better do as lasked. Well, just then
my brother Rex and the two other drillers came
into the rig-house from outside the rigs, making
it so that all six of us were then in the rig-house
which was built of planks and heavy tin. It wasa
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 618

good thing that we were all in there because just
then the steam boiler blew up, completely des-
troying the 'doghouse', partially blowing out the
walls of the offside of the rig-house and shooting
steam and hot water in all directions, The tin
part of the rig-house had protected us from the
steam and hot water and from most of the explo-
sion, and later we were able to crawl out of the
break in the rig-house on the lumber side. I have
never forgotten the feeling that came as a warning
to me that day and we all knew at the time that we
had been protected by a heavenly power far beyond
our understanding.!!

LaFaun writes; ''Father spent so much money
drilling unsuccessfully for oil on his 882 acre ranch
that he lost the ranch and also his pretentious home
in Lyman. He and the family were forced to move
to a modest place in another part of Lyman, which
mother tried to make more pleasant by surrounding
it with beautiful shrubs and flowers,"

Soon their eight children all married and left
home, or left home and married, as the case
happened to be, and Louis and Florence were left
to live modestly in their little home in Lyman. Of
the eight, only Weldon chose to spend his married
years in Lyman and eventually built a home for his
family next door to his parents. The others came
home quite often and were always welcomed with,
open arms, and Louis and Florence went to visit
their out-of-town children on occasions,

' Florence passed away in Ruth, Nevada, 24.
Nov. 1952, She was brought back to Lyman for
burial, Left alone, Louis lived by himself in >
Lyman, with Weldon and his wife next door to sort
of look after him when he was there, But he was
‘very lonely and restless and his eyes were giving
him trouble, due to a diabetic condition, - He was
forced to use a cane when he went places, to be
more sure of his step. He began to travel quite a
bit each month and LaFaun tells of this: ''The last
few years.of father's life he traveled almost con-
tinually, first to California to see Rose, then to
Nevada to see Alice and Marjorie, then to Salt
Lake ‘City to see me, and then on to Nampa, Idaho
to see Dale and Ruby, as long as Dale was alive.
<span id="page-??"></span>

Then he would go back to Lyman to pay current
bills, then he'd start the travel routine again, I
used to drive him from Salt Lake home to Lyman
about every other week and clean his house through
for him. I always drove up to Lyman and back on
Saturdays as I had to be back to Salt Lake for Sun-
day church commitments and back to work on
Monday.

"On Saturday, the last of January 1959, I
drove father home to Lyman, When we entered
the house the bathroom floor was partially torn up,
a strange tie was on the buffet and the quilts I
always used to make a bed on the davenport were
gone. Father looked in the closet and said his gun
was gone too. I was upset and worried. Many con-
victs had threatened his life over the years, I
begged him to come back home with me but he
refused, saying he had to pay current utility bills
on Monday. Monday night I phoned him from Salt
Lake to see if he was alright, as Iwas so worried
for fear someone had been in his house who meant
trouble. But father said he was Ok."

Weldon writes: - ''Dad had been one of the
best sheriffs Evanston or Lyman ever had and his
record in Evanston proved it. He destroyed more
stills during those bootlegging days than any other
law enforcement agent. (We have pictures of stills
being destroyed by him.) But you know, there
were people calling him up on the phone during his
last days. His phone would ring and when he'd
answer 'Hello' there would be no answer. I know
this to be a fact as Iwas at his house and close to
the phone on two separate occasions when calls
came. Ihave no idea how many calls of this kind
Dad had, but it was evident that someone was try-
ing to frighten or confuse him, We wondered if it
was some of the people he had arrested over the
years who had threatened at the time to 'get him'
or 'to get even'. It was a constant worry.

"One night Beth, my wife, and I saw the
shadow of someone walking between Dad's house
and ours, We could see Dad through his lighted
window walking around inside his house and there
was the outline of someone walking between our
house and his lighted window. Beth and I took out
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 620

after this shadow - but it got away through the lilac
bushes and over the fence before we could get to it.

"On Feb. 5, 1959, Dad visited with me at my
house, as he often did when he was home in Lyman.
He seemed the same as usual ~ very relaxed and
calm. He talked to me for a couple of hours then
I guess, while I cleaned my day's gathering of eggs.
He told me at this time that he had dreamed about
mother, his earnestness showing in his face. He
seemed a little embarrassed to tell of something so
close to his heart. He said that in this dream, or
whatever it was, it seemed as though mother was
standing in front of him, her feet not touching the
floor. He said her being there didn't seem like a
dream but a reality and he was so happy to see her
that he began crying a little and then said to her:
'Hello Sweetheart'. She answered, 'Hello Lou -
I'm going to bring you a present in a little while
dear'. He said, 'Oh darling, all I want is you!'

At this mother smiled a little and then just faded
away. ‘I don't know what she meant', said Dad
then, 'but it surely seemed good to see her.' Then
he looked over at me and said he hoped he hadn't
worried or embarrassed me by telling me of this
and I told him I was glad he had. Dad then said,
‘It's time you fed your chickens for night isn't it?'
I looked up at the clock - it was 3:30 p.m. 'Yes,
I guess I'd better feed them and then go up and get
Beth from work', I said, and then we both left the
house, he going towards his house and I out to the
coops to feed the chickens. ‘Well, I'll see you
later dear' he said and I answered, 'Ok, and I'll
see you'.

"The next morning, Feb, 6, 1959, I had been
to work at the school house (driving bus) and had
also taken Beth there to her work. I usually
gathered my eggs three times a day to cut down
on breakage, so I went out to the coop to gather
eggs. As I walked across the floor to the far end
of the coop I spotted an egg on the floor. Ihad
stooped over to pick it up when the strangest feeling
of foreboding came over me - like the time the
boiler blew up on the ranch, I don't know how long
I stood there puzzled, knowing something was wrong
somewhere, when suddenly I walked out of the coop
<span id="page-??"></span>
621 Louis

without finishing gathering the eggs, set my bucket
down and went straight over to Dad's house. I
knocked but there was no answer so I stepped in- -
side and called to Dad - but there was still no
answer. I went hastily to his bedroom, It was
dark there as the blinds were down as usual. I
turned on the light and froze stiff. There was my
father on his bed - dead. -He had been shot and a
gun was in his own hand... Finally I gathered my
stunned. senses together and looked the situation
over very carefully without moving from the spot.
I started to cry and then got out of there and went
to find Beth and then ask some people to call the
sheriff at Evanston and also the coroner. They
put it down as a suicide but I myself will never
believe that it was. I can't prove anything but I
just know that it wasn't, without a doubt." After
appropriate and beautiful funeral services, Louis

was buried beside his beloved wife in the Lyman
Cemetery, 9 Feb. 1959.

Their daughter Alice wrote: - ''I have had
the grandest father, mother, sisters and brothers
on earth - just a marvelous home life with them."
And their daughter Rose concludes this history by
writing: - ''From my sentimental, loving Dad I
think I might have inherited my love for music.
Always I shall remember his rich, deep voice
reflecting his moods - to awaken us in the mornings -
to entertain us while he sat and chorded his own
accompaniment - to rock me to sleep until Iwas
so tall he'd turn sideways to get me through the
door while I pretended to be asleep..

'He had a fine sense of humor and keen per-
ception with his love of people. We used to have
wonderful discussions on countless subjects and
were great friends. He had the air of sweet
dignity and old-fashioned courtliness that is seldom
seen today. Wherever I've gone, someone has
remembered him and gone out of their way to help
me because of it. I rented. a room in Santa Monica,
Calif. at one time from an old woman who, I found
out later, was from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and
who said Dad had captured the murderer of her
grocer-husband - she couldn't do enough for me
after she found out who Iwas. This is typical of
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 622
what I mean.

"In spite of his size, my Dad never was
ashamed to show and speak of his love for his
family. I have many letters I1treasure from him
in which he speaks of his great love and pride in
us all. He was a wonderfully kind and loving —
father, with a heart that couldn't say 'no' to anyone
in need, “My girls called him 'Big Grandpa' and
were surprised to find that he also knelt to pray;

I guess they thought only we smaller people needed
the guidance of a higher power," ,

_ Sarah Florence Mellor (Christensen), wife of
Louis "Dt Christensen, was born 4 July [879 in
Dover, a very small pioneer Mormon community a
short distance west of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah, but
no longer in existence, She was the daughter of
James Mellor Jr. and Charlotte Elizabeth Dack
(Mellor).early Utah Mormon pioneers of English
extraction: The Mellor family soon moved from
Doverito Fayette-and became prominent members
of that Mormon community.

"Florence attended the public schools available
at the time in Fayette, and it is doubtful if she ob-
tained any more formal schooling. But she became
‘well taught in the school of life, for before she was
fourteen her mother died and her father, being a
polygamist, went to live with his other wife, leaving
young Florence in charge of four younger brothers
and sisters and with only the minimum of help from
him.

Florence soon learned the arts of running a
pioneer home with all the intricacies of rug making,
soap making, butter making, bread making, candle
making, etc. If she often learned the hard way,
being without the instruction of her precious mother,
yet she learned and became a good’ cook, a compe-
tent seamstress and a fine homemaker. She learned
to be frugal and 'make ends meet" - there were no
other dependable ways of survival in those early days.

Florence was a beautiful girl, rather small of
stature, with wavy dark brown hair and big brown
<span id="page-??"></span>
623 Louis

eyes. She was gentle, kind and loving by nature -
sympathetic and understanding. She was quiet and
soft-spoken and she had almost unending patience,
She was very religious, with an abundance of faith,
hope and charity that helped mold her into an out-
standing wife and mother.

She was courted and won by Louis Christen-
sen, alarge, curly-headed handsome fellow of
Danish parentage who lived in northwest Gunnison
along the main road that then ran from Gunnison
to Fayette, about six miles distance. The wedding
date was set, Florence and her younger sister
made her wedding dress of white ''china silk",
Florence saved this dress and later used the
material to make a ''christening robe'! for her first
daughter, Florence LaFaun. The marriage of
Florence and Louis took place in the beautiful
Manti Temple, Wed. 6 Mar. 1901. A lovely
wedding reception was held for them by the parents
of Louis, Laurs and Else K. Christensen, in their
home in Gunnison that same evening.

Louis came to make his home in her childhood
home in Fayette, but within three months he was
called to serve a mission for the church in Colorado,
- leaving Florence in rather poor health as we have
learned. Her condition worsened and though her
mother-in-law, Else K., who was a doctor and
nurse, did all she could to assist her, it was
thought wise to have Louis called home to be with
her and help in her care, and to be on hand for the
birth of their first child, LaFaun, born 12 Dec.
1901 in the old Mellor home in Fayette.

From Fayette Florence and Louis and child
moved to the Wasden home across the road south
of Laurs' and Else's in Gunnison, where two other
' children were born to them, both boys, Lucien and
Rex. Else was always on hand to help deliver the
new babies and to care for them and the mother.
Florence must have felt lost without her kind and
efficient mother-in-law nearby when they moved
west a mile or so onto a ranch while Rex was still
a baby.

Louis was away a lot with the sheep and Rex
was sickly and hemorrhaged easily and often.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Louis 624

LaFaun tells that at such times her mother would
almost despair, alone in the poorly equipped farm
house the ranch afforded, with only the three little
ones and no neighbors or help within a mile or more.
She would do all that she knew how to do to help the
child and then gather the two older children to her
and kneel beside the baby's bed and pray earnestly
for help from the Heavenly Father. LaFaun says
she will never forget those prayers for help, and
feels sure that her mother pulled little Rex through
with faith and prayers. She can still hear the lullaby
her mother sang to him as she sat and rocked and
rocked and rocked him in her arms to comfort and
soothe him.

Another little boy was born to Florence and
Louis and they named him Spencer. But they were
not permitted to raise this little one and he passed
away within five weeks, 6 May 1908. They then
moved back to Gunnison into Louis! childhood home,
which his parents vacated in preparation for a trip
back to Denmark. In this comfortable rock house
three more babies were born, two boys and a girl.

Though Louis was gone with the sheep a great
deal, life in the rock house was more pleasant, the
church and school were nearby and the older child-
ren were getting to be some help, Then Louis took
up homestead land near Lyman, Wyoming and decided
to move the family there. So bag and baggage they
all bid Gunnison farewell and took the train for
Wyoming, 27 Mar. 1916, together with Louis'
sister Elsie C. Bartholomew and her five children.

Life on the frontiers of Wyoming was not an
easy one, especially while living on and developing
the ranch to meet homesteading requirements. The
first two and a half years were especially difficult
ones, since unknown but unscrupulous persons who
coveted the range they were taking up tried to run
them off their property by burning down their ranch
home twice and devious other ways - leaving them
in a state of constant upset.

When Louis was elected county sheriff and
they moved into Evanston, Wyoming and later when
he was appointed State Commissioner of Law
Enforcement and they lived in Cheyenne, things
<span id="page-??"></span>
625 Louis

were a little easier. Two more daughters had
been added to the family however, making eight
living children in all to call Florence mother.

When reverses came, sometime after returning

to Lyman to live and the family were forced to

seek more modest quarters, Florence's flower
garden and shrubs brightened their surroundings
and their lives and even drew the attention of many
flower lovers in the area. LaFaun writes: -
"Mother's flowers and gardens proved attractive

to many people and particularly to a number from
the extension division of the University of Wyoming,
as flowers, fruits and shrubs that it was supposedly
not possible to grow in Wyoming were grown in her
well kept yard.

"She was always an outstanding mother and
homemaker. Besides raising her four brothers
and sisters she raised eight children of her own
and buried one. Her wise budgeting of expenses’
kept the family on an even keel for many, many
years.'' Though blessed with many talents she
made that of homemaking and motherhood her
greatest goal in life and it was indeed her glory.

Florence was in rather poor health the last
few years of her life. When at last it was too
difficult for her to take care of herself, or for
Louis to either, she went to be with some of her
married daughters, a few months with Rose in
Santa Monica, Calif., and then with Marjorie in
Ruth, Nevada. It was while in Ruth that she passed
away, 24 Nov. 1952.

and family, for flowers and animals. She was kind
and sweet to everyone. She spent two months with
us before her death and never did she complain
about the crippling, painful arthritis she had and
the discomfort of the edema which was to take her
life. Instead of taking the pain pill the doctor had
given her, each night she would ask me to lift the
venetian blind on the door so she could see the
flowers outside. They were so beautiful to her
that they made her forget her pain. She especially
enjoyed the moonlit nights. She was one of those
'green thumbers!' who could grow anything, and her
own yard had always been a showplace for the town,
Her mother had died when she was not much more
than twelve and her life had been a hard one, but
she was never bitter. Her faith and love helped us
all. She was always a real friend to me and we
enjoyed so many hours together as long as she
lived,"

(8) ARTHUR MARINUS CHRISTENSEN

Arthur (twin) ninth child but eighth producing
branch of the Laurs M, C, and Else K. Christensen
family, was born about four o'clock a.m, 19 July
1882 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. He was named
and blessed that same day by his paternal grand-

father, Christen Christensen, His twin sister born
_ shortly after him that same morning was blessed
and named Martina Lauriette right away but died

about noon the day of her birth.

It is doubtful that the new rock house on the
Christensen lot in northwest Gunnison had been
‘completed by the time of the twins!’ birth so the
must have been born in the old two-roomed adobe
house that stood well back on that lot at 180 West
lst North, which dwelling has long since been
demolished. However, the Christensen family,
then numbering ten, must have moved into their
new rock house built west and south and near the
old one, while Arthur was very young, at least to
live in the winter months. This ''new rock house",
though now very old, is still standing and owned
and occupied at present (1969) by Ella Knighton Hansen,

627 Arthur

Arthur's first several summers were spent
with his parents and brothers and sisters in
Christenburg where his father had leased a farm.
The boy was often left in the charge of his older
brothers and sisters, since his mother was a
doctor and midwife and her services were much
sought after in Gunnison Valley.

When of proper age he entered the public
schools at Gunnison, which convened within a few
blocks of his home. Soon after he turned eight
years old, Sat. 6 Aug. 1890, he was baptized in _
the Sanpitch River some distance from his home
by Brother C, J: Swenson. Brother R. G. Fraser
confirmed him next day,: Sun. 7 Aug. 1890, in
church,

Arthur's youth was spent attending school in

winters and working at home and on land farmed
by his father in summers, There was plenty for
all to do on their place with chickens, ducks, cows,
horses, lambs and pigs to feed and care for, as
well as a large gardenand a lucerne patch. His
parents were not ones who liked to see their |
children idle. Arthur was often found in the
companionship of his brother Louis, some two
years older and much larger. When they were
old enough their oldest brother, Chris "I", gave
the two work with his herds and thus they learned
early of the sheep herding business. This was a
great family to work together and help each other
out.

Arthur was ofa gentle, kind and patient
nature, like his father. He had a happy disposition
and was easy to get along with. That his older,
fun-loving brother Louis sometimes took advantage
of this to involve him in 'pranks" can well be
imagined. (A few of these have been related
earlier in the book.) That their youngest sister,
Elvena, often became a victim of their mischief:
we can be sure. But Arthur grew to manhood a
hard worker, dependable and loving life. -

_ Arthur's parents, but more particularly his
mother, had a great desire that their children
become well educated. Most of his older brothers
and sisters had gone on to school following their
<span id="page-??"></span>
Arthur 628

eighth grade education and several had graduated
from the B. Y. A. in Provo. Whatever his reasons,
Louis refused to go on to school and this undoubtedly
had some effect on Arthur. However, his parents
finally persuaded him to get some higher education
and he attended the B. Y, A. the winter of 1901/1902.
He roomed that year at 333 East 5th North in Provo,
which was the David Jones home, no longer standing.
Whether he attended college more than that one
winter we cannot be certain, although it is quite
possible that he may have attended B. Y.A. the
following winter also.

Arthur was ''keeping company'! at the time
with a girl, Millie Gledhill, a pretty dark-eyed,
dark-haired young lady of many talents who lived
two blocks west of his home in Gunnison, Though
she was not attending school at Provo they corres-
ponded regularly. Her brother Bert gives this
account of how the two became interested in each
other: -- ''During those days in Gunnison Grandpa
and Grandma Christensen (I always called them
this) kept a boarding house and my older sister
Millie went to work for Grandma, helping with the
housework and cooking. Of course this brought
Arthur Marinus Christensen and Amelia Jane
"Millie'' Gledhill together in courtship - and later
marriage."

Millie's sister, Mary Gledhill Dowdle, now
in her eighties, tells of their marriage: - ''When
Arthur and Millie were married they went to the
Manti Temple, 3 Feb. 1904. She turned twenty -
two twenty-three days later. She was five months
older than he, , lacking one week. A large wedding
reception was held that night at our home and, as
was the custom, a big dinner was served to all the
guests.

"The two first lived in a small house two
doors east of his parents, Grandpa and Grandma
Christensen as we called them, but when mother
died about a year later (1905) they moved two and
a half blocks west into our home so that Millie
could care for father and us younger Gledhill
children. It was here, 22 June 1905, that their
first child Arthur Melrose was born. He was a
beautiful baby and they nicknamed him 'Rosy','"!
<span id="page-??"></span>

<span id="page-??"></span>
629 Arthur

Millie's brother Bert continues with his
story: -- ''After leaving the Gledhill home where
Melrose was born, on 367 West lst North in Gunni-
son, which is still standing, Arthur and Millie
moved to a home on Second South and Second West,
which I believe they rented and which has long since
been torn down. Here their next three children
were born, which included another son, Wesley,
and a pair of twin girls, Grace and Gladys.

"After his marriage Arthur was associated
with his brother A. H. Christensen in the sheep
business, They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt,
east of Salina. After lambing, about July lst, they
would move into Twelve Mile Canyon for the sum-
mer months and then winter onthe west desert.

As Ilremember, Arthur and his brother Lou took
care of the sheep on the desert until the later years.
Il also helped Arthur with the sheep at times. The
summer of 1910 we got word to take 1500 head of
sheep and start for the Weber River area above
Oakley, Utah. Arthur met us above Gunnison and
was in charge from there on, That, I believe, was
the start of the Bennion Livestock Company in
which Arthur, A. H. and Chris "'I'' Christensen
became interested, Chris '"'I'' was made general
manager of the company.

'In the summer of 1910 also, Chris ''I'' sold
out his interests in Gunnison and moved his family
to Salt Lake City, but spent most of his time on
"The Weber' where the Bennion Livestock Company
owned a large ranch and had their main headquar-
ters. Arthur bought Chris' home at this time and
moved his family there to 3rd West Ist South.

This home is standing today. In 1911 the Bennion
Livestock Company bought a small ranch at Upton,
Utah, in Summit County on Huff Creek from a Mr.
Benson and Arthur was appointed foreman of that
ranch. He moved his family to Upton the spring of
1911. LIlived with Arthur and Millie and worked

on the ranch for some time. Though not a rendez-
vous for the Bennion Livestock Company's herders,
they came there for supplies which were hauled
twelve miles by team from Coalville."

Millie was then expecting her fifth baby and
as winter came on and the year began to draw to a
<span id="page-??"></span>
Arthur 630

close her hour of delivery grew nearer, They
rented a small place in Coalville, where she could
be near a doctor and medical help. She and the
four children moved there for about a month and
Arthur was by her side as much as he could be.
The child, a little girl, came 18 Jan. 1912,

Arthur dropped a card to his father-in-law, Nephi
Gledhill of Gunnison, Utah, that same day, announc-
ing her birth: - 'Dear Father" it read, "a girl - at
Coalville - 9 lbs. Our girl came a little sooner
than expected - but all seems to be well, Arthur,!'!
They gave her a blessing and a name, Mildred,
right away, but little Mildred died the following
day, 19 Jan, 1912, of prematurity. She was buried
in Coalville,

Both Grace and Gladys have vivid recollections
of those days. Gladys writes: -- 'Grace and I used
to play in the storehouse at Upton, which was
sometimes used for the storage of dynamite. One
of our favorite games was playing 'Papa and Mama’,
One day Grace was the papa, whose job it was to
get up in the morning to make the fire. We had
some matches and she set fire to an old rope which
was hanging from the ceiling. About that time
mother called us and we scampered out, not
realizing that in a matter of minutes the whole .
place might be ablaze. Our Uncle Bert Gledhill
spotted the smoke and got everyone out of the house
ina hurry, as they thought there was dynamite in
the storehouse, But there wasn't. Grace and I
didn't tell 'til years later that we had started the
fire, and then no one believed us,

Grace writes:-- 'When our family moved to
Upton Gladys seemed to be the constant concern of
everyone there, Besides falling into the ditch and
almost drowning, had not Uncle Bert saved her,
she fell down the elevator shaft at Coalville, to
say nothing of setting the storehouse on fire at our
home in Upton, Iwas in on this too, and I can
remember being thrown over the fence in an awful
hurry - and words about 'gun powder being stored
there’,

"Both Melrose and Wesley started school at
Upton, They rode horses - we all did, the four of
us kids on one horse at times. Melrose was
<span id="page-??"></span>
631 Arthur

‘reliable and was the 'boss' when Dad and Mother
were away. I remember the flash flood and water
running through the house in all directions and the
four of us standing on the table with fire shovels,
trying to shovel it out.

"I remember the wonderful music made by
my father and mother, Their sweet voices blended
so beautifully. Mother played the guitar and dad
the mandolin. At this time I thought there was
nothing so heavenly. Many times we were lulled
to sleep by their songs."

Both Arthur and Millie had good voices and
loved music. Arthur had sung in the Gunnison
ward choir in his younger days, along with his
older brother Louis. Millie had done some public
entertaining, along with her younger sisters, Mary
and Sylvia, when she was a girl at home. Arthur
and Millie were fine companions. Both were young
at heart and both really loved life. They had such
good times together - and how they loved to dance!
Whenever possible they attended the local dances
at Upton regularly.

Dances were held in the Upton amusement
hall on weekends. On special occasions children's
dances were held in the afternoons and then the
adults would take over and dance until dawn, usually
to music on the organ and the violin. This was not
an ordinary amusement hall but a very unique one.
It was built by the small community in 1891 and was
50 feet long 26 feet wide and 13 feet high, with
-wainscoating up from the bottom 4 feet. The
unusual thing about it was the upper walls, for on
these a local artist, Frank Clark who had joined
the LDS church in England and come to Zion in |
1863, finally settling in Upton, had painted some
outstanding murals, One side was the scene of an
Indian village, the other a landscape scene com-
plete with animals, The battleship Maine covered
one end of the hall and a steam engine pulling many
cars covered the other. It was quite a sight and
visitors came from all over the west to see this
magnificent hall and to dance init,

- Arthur and Millie themselves usually had
visitors in summers, for they were excellent

company and had many friends, Also, their rela-
tives often came. Arthur's father, Laurs, spent
at least one summer helping on the ranch there.
Arthur's sister Elvena also came to stay with
them for a time and help Millie out. Few visited
in winters however, for these were very cold and
Upton folks were often snowed in. But the dances
went on there just the same.

The fall of 1915, when the twins were ready
to enter school for the first time, Arthur moved
the family back to Gunnison into their home they
had bought from his brother Chris ''I''. Grace
writes: -- ''We moved back to Gunnison and mother
really had her hands full trying to get Gladys and
me ready for our first day at school. All our
things were handmade, even our bloomers and
hand knit stockings. How we longed for something
‘store bought’. I recall so well the old rain barrel
that stood by our house. The soft rain water it held
was used for washing our long hair, One day, as
we children were all lined up for inspection, Wesley
backed into it, Gladys and I shrieked with delight
at the big splash - but we were silenced by a whop!
'You just simply have no regard for the efforts of
your mother' said our dad."

Later that fall Arthur bought the lovely red
brick house of his sister Elsie Bartholomew. She
was estranged from her husband at the time and
‘desired to move into less expensive quarters. He
traded the home they were living in in southwest
Gunnison in on the deal and Elsie and her children
moved into that old home, which had been built by
their brother Chris, and Arthur and his family
moved into the nice new home in the northeast part
of town. This was in the latter part of 1915, but
whether the move took place before the birth of
Arthur's and Millie's sixth child, David, 16 Nov.
1915, is not known for sure, although Millie's
sister Mary G. Dowdle says that David was prob-
~ ably born in the new red brick home. Grace
writes:-- "Our family moved into a handsome red
brick house. This was wonderful - pavement all
over, up to the barn, around the house, down to
the. street - everywhere it seemed. We children
raced around in our little wagons."
<span id="page-??"></span>
633 Arthur

Arthur leased a farm of some 327 acres
from Gussie Villard northwest a few miles from
Gunnison, His brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill,
worked for him here, Gladys writes: -- "After
we moved into the beautiful red brick house in
northwest Gunnison, I guess we didn't have much
-money, as mother took in boarders, Then one
summer soon after, we almost cried when we
found out our dad and mother had rented our
beautiful house to some 'foreigners' and we were
going to move to the farm northwest of Gunnison,"

Arthur moved his family back into the red
brick house the fall before their seventh child,
Max, was born, 17 Oct. 1920. Grace writes: --
"Gladys and I were going on twelve when Max was
born, He was the only one of us children that was
born ina hospital. Mother went to Salina and I
remember the concern that she might not make it.
It was shortly after this that Father and Mother
decided to go into the grocery business and politics.
Dad was persuaded by friends to run for Mayor of
Gunnison, He lost the race by about two votes.
Actually, he was relieved-to have lost for his heart
wasn't init - nor the grocery store either, He
longed to be back outside with the animals and the
soil - so took up farming again,"'

By the fall of 1924 both Melrose and Wesley
had gotten tired of no prospects in Gunnison except
farming and struck out on their own. They soon
found work in the mines in Juab County. Arthur.
and Millie had the opportunity to buy a hotel in
Manti and Millie decided she wanted to try her
hand at it and so they sold their lovely home in
Gunnison and at Christmas time that year took
over the Eagle House hotel in Manti. Millie was
a hard worker, a great manager and a wonderful
cook, The twins, now in their Sophomore year in
high school, were a lot of help to her and soon
things were running smoothly. _ i

Arthur left the running of the hotel to the
women, There seemed little need for him there
much of the time. He was an ambitious fellow
and a hard worker, growing restless when forced
to be idle too long. He finally went to the mine
where his two oldest sons were employed. Leola
<span id="page-??"></span>
Arthur 634

Burraston, who later became his daughter-in-law,
wrote of this:-- "It was in 1927, I believe, when
Arthur first came to the mine,. Iwas assistant
postmistress at the Tintic Standard Mining Co.,

in Dividend. He worked in the mine for a few
months, You know he was never idle. Millie had

the hotel at Manti at that time. He used to talk to

me a good deal at that time. He was so much like
his son Wesley in manner - very quiet but so thought-
ful and kind.

"In 1928 Arthur bought a ranch (in Flat Can-
yon) and asked Wes if he would like to quit at the
mine and help him at this time. Wes didn't really
want to leave Dividend but he loved his father
dearly and desired to be with him, He was under-
ground and young and could see the benefits of
getting out into the open air and under God's sky -
but mostly it was to be with his father that swung
the decision. Arthur wasn't really feeling too well
at this time but still he had come to the mine and
then the two of them left for Flat Canyon early in
the spring of 1928,

"A few months after they left Arthur became
very ill. He was a hemophiliac and even if he had
a tooth pulled he feared a hemorrhage. He suffered
from frequent nosebleeds and at that time he had a
particularly severe one, Wes rushed him to the
hospital in Salt Lake City, I believe."

Arthur recovered and was able to go back to
work, Later, Wesley returned to the mine in
Dividend. It was about that time that Arthur
received an opening with the Howell Livestock
Company. This was the company that had bought
out the Bennion Livestock Company sometime after
the death of his brother Chris "I", (about 1918).
Arthur went to work for this new company as fore-
man of their Trout Creek ranch, which was in
southern Utah out some distance from Delta and
close to the Nevada border, Here they produced
upwards of 4, 000 turkeys yearly, which were
shipped to California and sold. as "Howell! Ss: “Holiday
Turkeys. " ' af ;

Though Trout Creek was quite a distance
from. Manti, Arthur’ came home on occasions and
<span id="page-??"></span>
635 Arthur

Grace writes of one of these: -- ''We were all
together for our parents' Silver Wedding anniver-
sary, Feb. 3, 1929. The hotel was full of friends
from all over. Melrose pulled a real surprise.
He and Reva Giles, who had been married two days
before, unknown to any of us, chose this time and
place to make their announcement. The hat was
passed and they started off on their honeymoon.
Wesley and Leola Burraston were married a few
months later, Both boys met their wives in
Dividend, "'

Grace continues: -- ''I often looked at my
mother and thought of the wonderful job she was
doing as manager of the hotel there in Manti.
Many times I marveled at her - truly a beautiful
woman, with warm brown eyes and classic fea-
tures. My father too was a handsome, honest and
kind man. He was the smallest of the Christensen
brothers, being of about average height but taller
than mother, I feel sad at times to think that they
were separated so much in their later years of
marriage,"!

Arthur was still working at Trout Creek in
November of 1931, as a letter written 5 Nov. 1931
by Max, then eleven, indicates, among other things.
It was written to Gladys who was then working in
Salt Lake and read as follows: -- "Dear Gladys,
how are you? Iam fine and so is the rest of the
family. We had a surprise today - Dad came home.
He is alright although he said he had a little pain
in his neck. , . Mother has dozed off to sleep in
her chair; Daddy is taking a bath; Jack Burns is
sitting listening to the radio. I don't know where
Dave is right now but I guess he will be home soon.
He and I have been playing with paper airplanes
tonight and having a lot of fun. Dave is going back
out with Dad to help pick feathers off the turkeys
for a couple of weeks. I wish I could go too,
Daddy says next time he comes home he will bring
us a lot of pinenuts. He says he likes the new boy
out there and that he sure is a good worker, Jack
Burns is still playing the radio. It seems it is
about nine o'clock and soon time for Amos and
Andy. . .'' This letter was written on stationery
bearing the heading: ''Eagle Hotel - Mrs. A. M,.

Christenson, Prop. Home Like - Reasonable."

It was while ranching at Trout Creek, how-
ever, that Arthur's health began to fail desperately
and he was forced to return home, They were
shocked to see how pale and thin he had become,

A letter from Max to Gladys, 13 Oct, 1932, anda
postscript from Millie, follows: ''Dear Gladys:
How are you all up there? We are all fine except
Daddy. He is pretty sick tonight. I received your
present the day before my birthday and thanks very
much. Grace gave me a pair of cords. Mama gave
me shorts and shirts and sox and let me have a
party. When I got my money all together it made
$2.00. We invited fifteen boys with myself and
served punch and cookies and had a melon bust.
Just when we got the melon we saw some smoke
and the siren started to sound and boy, did we go!
Some man said of us - 'There goes the fire squad',
It was an old woodshed up by Mrs. Wilson's, Dave
has a swell new typewriter. It is soon halloween.
Mother is calling supper - so goodbye - Max.''! The
P.S, by Millie read: -- "Gladys, there isn't any-
thing much to tell you and Iam pretty busy. Have
a few railroad men and others here and Papa needs
waiting on. He is going to the hospital next week,
as soon as it is opened, amd stay until he is better,
It is sure hard on all of us. Dave is going deer
hunting next week - love, Mother."

A letter from Millie to Gladys, Oct. 15, 1932,
follows:-- ''Dear Gladys, I got your letter yesterday
just as we were leaving for Salina. I took Papa to
the hospital; he didn't feel as if he could make the
trip to Salt Lake. I'm almost afraid we've waited
too long and the future doesn't look too good, I
called Dr, Hagan Monday and he said to take him
to the Doctors Merrill. They gave him a thorough
examination and he was in no condition to have an
X-ray so he is taking medicine and trying to get
built up to have it next Monday.

"They found his blood pressure thirty degrees
too low and not enough red corpusles. They told
me on the side that he is in very bad shape and if
he ever gets well it will take months. They don't
think it's his stomach at all but in the blood, They
have sent some blood to Salt Lake to be tested for
<span id="page-??"></span>
637 Arthur

diabetes. They could find no sugar in the urine

but think it may be in the blood and this test has

to be done in Salt Lake. He is in’no pain much

now but so tired and weak, He sleeps all too much
and no matter what he eats or how much he is still
hungry. He looks bad and the last few days pale.
They may take him to Salt Lake, Idon't know. The
hospital in Salina has closed but the doctors have
their offices there.

"T am all unstrung - haven't slept much for
three nights and am trying to get fruit put up. I
was. gone all day yesterday. Grandma (Sorena)
stayed here, There is not much business right now,
Dave and Max are studying. I wish you would come
home more often. Grace was up to institute today
but I guess she didn't have time to run down and
see us. I had a letter from the boys (at Dividend);
they all had bad colds over there, Can't write any-
more tonight - Mother,"

Another letter from Millie to Gladys afew :
days later, Tues. 19 Oct. 1932, gave the follow-
ing: -- "Dear Gladys, your last letter found me up
to my neck in peaches and plum jam. Hope I'll be
through with fruit this week. Dave took Papa to
Salina yesterday. They worked on him:all day and
didn't finish. He has to go back Sunday. Seems
that they just can't find his trouble but know that
there is something wrong. They tested him again
for diabetes but found no trace of sugar. They
should have returns on the blood tests they sent to
Salt Lake, Sunday also. .Now they think there.is |
an obstruction just at the place his stomach empties,
My, but it's a worry. He:feels a little better today
and is starving but must have nothing but: liquids.
He is almost too weak to walk. ban.

“Grace called last night. She said she
couldn't study or do anything for thinking of, him.
I will let you know if he gets worse, He is taking
medicine and Dr. Merrill seems to think it isn't
as serious as at first - but we wiil know more
after Sunday.

"Max is getting fat again and eats like a little
pig. He and Dave are studying; Papa is asleep; I
am baking bread and finishing my ironing. We have
<span id="page-??"></span>
Arthur 638

sent for a new typewriter for Dave and he isa
happy boy about that. I wish you would go to see
Elaine and Pearl too. Answer soon - love,
Mother,"

Arthur got no better and was rushed to the
Salina hospital. A card written by him from Salina
to Gladys in Salt Lake, Fri, 22 Oct. 1932, bore
this message: - ''Dearest Gladys: Your letter and
parcel came this morning, Thanks a lot dear, I
surely appreciate it. The doctors says I am better!
I surely have a lot of distress, After I eat it seems
worse than before but I guess it just has to be. I
get along pretty good in the day but the nights are
bad. I cannot sleep very long at a time and lay
awake so much but am trying to get better. Haven't
heard from mother since you were here - guess she
is awfully busy. Hope I can get away from here
before too long. Best love, Dad."

Some two weeks later Arthur was taken from
the hospital in Salina to the L.D.S, hospital in Salt
Lake City to undergo an abdominal operation. He
was in serious condition. A letter from twelve
year old Max, written to him at Manti Nov. 30,
1932 and sent by way of Gladys in Salt Lake, was
as follows: "Dear Daddy: - How do you feel by now?
We sure all feel sorry for you and are hoping that
you will soon get well and come home, It sure |
seems lonesome around here and we all felt so bad
when they phoned and said you had to have a second
operation, Ihave the flu but I am lots better now,
Mama has a little cold tonight but I guess she will
get alright. She is now cooking supper. Iam still
doing my beading work and I sure have made a lot
of bracelets and rings, It sure is fascinating. It
sure is warm down here now but it is cold some-
times, We have the furnace going now. The
bottom part of it burned out but Dave fixed it
tonight with some pieces of iron,

"Dave has got one load of fat pinewood since
you left and maybe we will get another Saturday.
We went out last Saturday and got a load of barley.
We haven't killed our pig yet because mother said
she couldn't take care of it now. Iam still busy
in my Scout work and doing fine. I sure wish I
could get up there to see you but I guess I can't
<span id="page-??"></span>
639 Arthur

until you are ready to come home, which I hope is
soon, Iam doing fine in school and I guess Dave
is too, We are ail sure wishing you were well and
wondering how you feel tonight, but I guess it won't
do us any good to wonder. Loads of love - Max,
(And hurry and get well!)"

Arthur passed away 4 Dec, 1932 in Salt Lake
City at age fifty years four months and fifteen days.
A ruptured gall bladder was said to have contributed
to his death. He was brought to Manti for burial
which took place Sunday 7 Dec. 1932 in the Manti
Cemetery. He was laid on a plot belonging to his
brother Albert and sold to the family, not far from
the last resting place of his father and mother,
Laurs and Else K. Christensen. The burial was
preceeded by an impressive funeral service, an
account of which was carried by the Manti Messen-
ger the following day, Dec. 8, 1932, under this
heading: - ''Death Comes to Relieve Sufferer"!

"True testimony of respect and love was
strongly pronounced Sunday afternoon for Arthur
M. Christensen when final rites were held at the’
North Ward chapel where a host of friends and
associates had gathered to pay last respects,
Merciful death claimed the life of Arthur Thursday
evening at a Salt Lake hospital, The passing
relieved him of untold agony and suffering.

'Three weeks ago Arthur was taken to the
hospital for an abdominal operation. For afew
days his life hung by a thread but he was given
several blood transfusions and he seemed to be
on the road to recovery. Suddenly he became
worse and a second operation was necessary,
which was performed Wednesday, but only added
to his suffering, His wife and daughter Gladys
and son David were by his bedside at his passing.

"Bishop E, T, Reed was in charge of the
services which were as follows: Opening song by
the choir - 'Abide With Me’, . Invocation was
offered by Elder Byron Peterson of Gunnison.
Other musical numbers were solos 'No Night
There' by Mrs, Sylvia Metcalf of Gunnison,
‘Resignation’ by Mrs, Elaine Southwick of Salt
Lake City, and 'Lay My Head Beneath the Rose!

Amelia Jane Gledhill (Christensen ) wife of
Arthur Marinus Christensen, was born 26 Feb,
1882 at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the daughter of
Nephi and Sarah Jane Caldwell Gledhill, of English
descent, Later her family moved to Gunnison,
Utah and there is where ''Millie'’", as she was
called, grew to womanhood, attending the schools
afforded by that community.

She belonged to a large family where girls
were in the majority and several of them very
talented in singing and entertaining. Two of her
younger sisters, Mary and Sylvia, sang together
a lot and were very good for that time. They sang
"Alexander's Ragtime Band" and ''Whispering Hope"
for the first time in that part of the country.

Millie herself was talented not only in music but
in many other ways.

She was a very pretty girl with lovely hair
and soft brown eyes, almost classic features and
of rather small stature. She was very popular as
a girl and young woman and had many friends and
admirers, One of these early friends wrote to
her, many many years later, the following: --
"Millie, dearest friend of my girlhood, how I did
idolize you! You were so beautiful and did every-
thing so well, I recall so well the laughing sparkle
of your eyes and the way your hair looked. How
I did wish I could be like you. . . . It is impossible
to express the gratitude I feel for friends like you.
God love you and keep you - lovingly, Eva,"

It was necessary for the Gledhill girls, as
well as the boys, to work when and where they
could out of the home. Mostly it was housework
for the girls unless one was fortunate enough to
get a position as salesgirl with a mercantile
<span id="page-??"></span>

establishment or take up school teaching. When
the new Gunnison Telephone Company was incor-
porated in 1909, in which Leo Gledhill took an
important part, Mary Gledhill operated the mag-
netic switchboard on the second floor of the post-
office building. Several years before, Mary
worked for Albert and Jennie Christensen in Manti
when their oldest son, Sherman, was born.

Millie went to work for Laurs and Else K.
Christensen, whom everyone called Grandpa and
Grandma, two and a half blocks east of the Gledhill
home. They were operating a boarding house at
the time and employed two girls, Millie helped
with the housework and the cooking and doubtless
learned a great deal about Danish cooking from
Else K. It was at this time that she became very
interested in the youngest Christensen son, Arthur,
a handsome blond young man with blue eyes. A
romance soon developed between the two and con-
tinued for several years, during part of which time
Arthur attended the B. Y. A. in Provo.

Millie and Arthur were married in the beauti-
ful Manti Temple on Wednesday 3 Feb, 1904. Millie
was nearly twenty-two and Arthur was some five
months younger. A history of the first few years
of their married life has been given briefly in
Arthur's life story, but the birth of their twin
girls is given more in detail by the oldest of the
twins, Grace, and by Millie's sister Mary Gled-
hill (Dowdle). Mrs. Dowdle writes: - ''When the
twins, Grace and Gladys, were born, Grace, a
large, blond Christensen baby, came first, not
long before midnight on 16 Feb. 1909. Two hours
later, 17 Feb. 1909, Gladys, atiny, sickly, dark
complexioned baby came. Millie, in her hysteria,
refused to own the second twin so the doctor put
her in my charge. I cared for this baby in my
room at home for two weeks and fed her with an
eye-dropper a combination of whiskey and some-
thing else which Dr. Hagan mixed up, Later Millie
was able to nurse both her babies and one other
baby who wasn't getting enough milk, Joseph's
and Roxie's Virgil."

Grace writes: - ''My parents were proud and
happy with their enlarged family, four children
<span id="page-??"></span>

under the age of four. Thentos, the way things
happened was quite the talk of the town - twins

born on different days. We were quite a drain on
mother's health, so I've been told, so it was decided
that Dad's sister, Aunt Vena, would take care of me
and mother's sister, Aunt Mary, would take Gladys
until mother should regain her strength.

'As I remember, or have been told, the rock
house in southwest Gunnison where we were born
was a square structure with an upstairs and balcony.
The water we used was taken from a well close to
the back door and for light we used kerosine lamps.
In fact, Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging
lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me.

I heard the grownups talk and joke so much about
this that I actually thought I had seen it. 'Well', I
told the folks when they questioned my remember-
ing, 'I was there and heard the bang, '"'

When the twins were going on two the family
moved to a ranch in Upton, Utah. The four years
spent there were mostly pleasant ones in spite of
the death of a day old baby girl, Mildred, their
fifth child, 18 Jan. 1912 at Coalville, where
Millie had gone to be near a doctor. The small
community of Upton with its some forty families,
mostly LDS, was a sociable town and many good
times were had there. Millie and Arthur especially
enjoyed the dances, Millie had her own saddlehorse
and drove the two-seated buggy in which she and the
children could come and go at will, even when the
menfolk were busy.

Moving back to Gunnison the fall of 1915, in
time to put the twins into school, Millie later had
the thrill of moving into the large and beautiful
"red-brick house! in time for the birth of her sixth
child and third son, David, 16 Nov. 1915. Arthur
was away much of the time on Bennion Livestock
Company business and when she was able, Millie
took in boarders, school teachers mostly,

She always kept her children looking nice,
The twins she dressed alike and kept their hair in
ringlets most of the time. They looked like little
dolls, Grace with her blond curls and blue eyes
and Gladys with her dark hair and dark eyes, She
<span id="page-??"></span>

didn't neglect the girls' musical education either,
for she was determined that they would learn both
* to play the piano and sing. I remember so well
going to the red brick house one time to visit,
when the twins were about eight. Millie, as proud
as she could be, had them stand up and sing to-
gether, with appropriate actions, the song ''I don't
Want to Play in Your Yard.'' I can still see them
in my mind's eye and hear their sweet, childish
voices, as if it were yesterday.

It was at Millie's and Arthur's red brick
house that the Laurs and Else K. Christensen
family gathered to have a family photograph taken,
about the time they brought the oldest son, Chris
"T'' from Wyoming for his burial in Gunnison, 12
Oct. 1917. It was in this home that they met later
in an inspiring family meeting, vowing to meet
from then on in yearly family reunions and to keep
closer together as a family.

When Millie and Arthur leased a farm north-
west of Gunnison and decided to move there, they
rented the red brick house. The children were
able to do a lot on the farm in summers ‘and
Millie's younger brother, Bert, came to work for
them also. Millie made ‘delicious butter and sold
it to the stores in Gunnison in wrappers with her
own name printed on them. This was always in
demand. In her own history, the daughter Gladys
comments on life on the farm: - ''There was a two-
roomed house on the farm and it was really sur-
prising how warm and comfortable mother made it
look, although it was rather crowded for our family
of seven, Mother wanted to be sure that Grace and
my muSical educations were not neglected, so down
to the farm went our piano, and every week there
were music lessons in town with plenty of: prac-
ticing in between,

Millie once told of how sad she was when
their two older boys, Melrose and Wesley, left _
home to look for work, She watched them walking
up the road carrying their suitcases, trying to
"thumb" their way north, as long as her eyes
could follow them - and then broke down and wept.
It is not a happy experience for a mother when her
first ''chicks' leave the home and Millie was no

Arthur 644

exception. In fact she was a very doting mother,
withall.

The move to Manti at Christmastime of 1924
and the taking over of the Eagle House hotel there
was a very challenging experience for Millie, but
she was equal to it in every way. She was a fine
cook, a good housekeeper, an excellent manager,
and people liked her, Besides, she seemed to be
an indefatigable worker and her health was good.
The fact that those years ahead, which then looked
so promising, should be saddened by the long illness
and untimely death of her dear husband, was a sor-
row to her indeed and left her very lonely. Two
letters written by her soon after his death, 4 Dec.
1932, one to her son Melrose, whom she called
"Rosy", and his family and one to her daughter
Gladys, who had both been home to their father's
funeral but returned to their homes in Salt Lake
City, show in a measure her sorrow but mostly
her courage: -

"Wed. 10 Dec. 1932, Dear Ones: Received
your card this A.M. Rosy, glad everything was
fine when you arrived home. I forgot about Mel-
vin's birthday (Dec. 5th) just when you left and felt
sorry about that. Iam sending him a small pack-
age today. The boys and I went to Gunnison late
Sunday afternoon right after you left. It seemed so
lonesome and awful here. We spent the evening at
Leo's (her brother) and left Grace for work next
morning. When we returned the house seemed so
empty and cold we three slept together. I'm so
thankful for Dave and Max. Last night Max said
to Dave, 'We can't both go to Mutual, we've got to
take turns staying with mother.' So Dave stayed.
Before the night was over seven people came in
and I have just given them breakfast. The lamb-
buyers came back. I have a hired girl to help me
house clean and catch up with so many neglected
jobs. She is ironing. We washed yesterday and
had the pig killed. I'll send you some when I get
at it.

"IT may go to Salt Lake this weekend, There
are bills and so much to tend to and we can do our
Christmas shopping. Grace wants to go. I had to
go to the bank this morning and borrow some money
<span id="page-??"></span>
645 Arthur

until the insurance check comes, Idon't know how
long that will take. I had spent about my last $1. 00,
Everything will be alright and I'm glad I have work
and can keep on 'keeping on'. So many people have
called to see me and I have a stack of letters and
cards, some from old friends I'd almost forgotten.
Our old crowd from Gunnison are coming up to-
night - about 20. It's grand to have friends and
you don't know how proud Iam of youall, Folks
never get through telling me how wonderful my
children are - and you are wonderful and that's
what keeps me up and trying to be brave. Write
often to your lonely mother."

It seems Millie and Grace did go to Salt Lake
that weekend, Grace was teaching school in Gunni-
son at the time. On their return, Millie made a.
report to Gladys: - 'Monday nite, 15 Dec. 1932.
Dear Gladys - This has been the coldest day I have
ever seen and tonight it is 20° below zero. Grace
and Theron had a terrible time this morning before
they got to Gunnison. I told them to take the Buick
(they couldn't start the Ford) but all of us together
couldn't start the Buick either, Theron gota car
from the Motor Company to push it but that didn't
help. They pushed it way down by the fairgrounds
but it was all froze up. Theron finally started his
car, then towed the Buick into the garage. I'll
leave it there to have it overhauled and fixed for
Christmas, About 10:30 a.m. Metcalf (Principal
of the Gunnison school where Grace taught), phoned
and said they had to dismiss school because they
couldn't get the schoolhouse warm and everything
was frozen up. Theron and Grace got there in
plenty of time for the afternoon, however, |

"We arrived home from Salt Lake about three
yesterday. Everything was ok but thank goodness
we didn't stay another night or everything would
have.been frozen up. My flowers were alright. |
We found Max sick at Uncle Albert's (in Provo),

He had been sick all the time we were gone but |
they had been so good to him and kept him in. He

is feeling better tonight but still has the earache.

I didn't wash today but have been cleaning upstairs -
had Fanny in to help me. A letter was here from
Uncle Bert saying he would be here right after the

Arthur 646

15th. (He came from Nevada and helped Millie
‘dispose of the Flat Canyon ranch. ) ,

''We stopped at Aunt Mary's (in Payson) and
had chili, She had an awful cold. Iwill send you
a check for Grace. Be sure her coat is sent insured
and right. There has been no bill from the hospital
yet. Guess I'll go crawl in bed with the boys to get
warm, It's lonesome tonight. Love - mother.
P.S. I received a nice long letter from Aunt Sarah
today, also from Edith, Elaine, Sherman, Bell and
Neil. And all of my Gunnison friends have written
or called,"

Grace was married less than a month after
her father's death, The Manti Messenger carried
the announcement: - 'Mrs. A, M. Christensen
announces the marriage of her daughter Grace to
Mr. Douglas Larsen of Salt Lake City, which took
place at Richfield, Tuesday Jan, 3rd (1933), Immed-
iately following the ceremony the newlyweds left for
a ten day visit in southern California. Grace is one
of Manti's popular young ladies, having been active
in the social life of our city. She is a graduate of
the High School and also Snow College, and for the
past number of years has been teaching at Gunnison.
Mr. Larsen is at present working for the State Road
Commission at Parawan, After March Ist the young
couple will make their home in Salt Lake City."

Millie stayed on keeping the hotel in Manti for
another three and a half years, with the help of
David and Max. ‘Then she decided to sell out and
move to Salt Lake City, where some of her older
children were then residing. She bought a home at
636 East 3rd South in Salt Lake. A letter to Gladys
about the last of April 1936 follows:-- ''Dear
Gladys: . . . Uncle Albert was down Saturday to
see me about my abstract of title, etc. We had it
all drawn up and thought it all ok, but their attor-
neys up there said it was not clear - no right of
way over the creek and some other flaws. He was
supposed to have gone to Salt Lake yesterday to
have it all fixed up. I expect a call anytime to go
to Salt Lake to close the deal. Can you go up and
take care of the house until school closes here? I
hate to take Max out of school and the home there
should have someone in it, I'll bring up bedding
<span id="page-??"></span>
647 Arthur

and enough things for you and Margaret to get along
until we move, which will be in a couple of weeks,

"We are awfully busy. Steve and Chris are
here besides a number of other men. One thing
sure, the Wimmer folks will take over a housefull.
We have a nice service station now on the corner
and Rastus is moving his dump away. Grace was
home most of last week. I surely hope Rosy is
having some business but somehow I worry about
them. I stayed home all day Sunday and worked
as usual. Dave had the car. He at last has found
a job (making brick) now that we are ready to move.
Such weather - it's awful today - cold and stormy.
Don't do anything about moving until you see or
hear from me again, Would you be afraid to live
in the home until we come?"

After nearly eleven and a half years as oper-
ator and manager of the Eagle House Hotel in Manti,
Millie took up her residence in Salt Lake City. But
she did not remain unemployed long, for she
accepted a position with Auerbach's Company in
the alterations. department and remained in their
employ for some seven years. On9 Mar, 1940
she married Octavious F, Gudmundson, an engineer
on the U. P. railroad, The family all called him
"Goodie'' and welcomed him into the fold.

Grace writes: - ''The big home mother bought
in Salt Lake proved to be a gathering place for
children and grandchildren. David had graduated
from Manti High School and Max attended West
High there in Salt Lake. Douglas and I had moved
to Salt Lake and were also living with mother.
Gladys also lived with mother and remained there
until 1942, when she left for San Francisco, Our
daughter Maxine Sydney was born while we were
living there, 17 Oct. 1943. We had brother Max
as her godfather for he was by that time in the
Navy and on the aircraft carrier Enterprise.

"In August 1950 Doug and I bought our present
home on Emerson Ave. Soon after mother sold ©
her big home and purchased a duplex near Liberty
Park, 1333 South 6th East, David and his family
bought and lived in one side of the duplex and ©
mother and Goodie in the other. Goodie died there
<span id="page-??"></span>
Arthur 648

20 Aug. 1951.'' His obituary notice was as follows: -
"Octavious F, Gudmundson, 75, retired U. P,
worker dies at Salt Lake residence, 1333 South 6th
East. Born 7 May 1876 in Fairview, Utah, a son

of Samuel and Inger Olsen Gudmundson, Filleda
mission for the Church to Norway, 1900-1903.
Married lst. Anna Mae Clark (div.); md, 2nd

Millie Gledhill Christensen, Died 20 Aug. 1951;
buried 24 Aug. 1951."

Millie had numerous friends in Salt Lake and
she continued to remain active, She was always
most thoughtful and considerate of her many rela-
tives and never missed an opportunity to be of
service to them. She was a member of the McKay
Ward, Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and the
"Silver Crest Club", a social group of ladies whom
she enjoyed very much. They had such good times
together. Though Millie's later years were saddened
by the death of her son Wesley, at 48, the grueling
service of her son Max during the second world war
as a crewman of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
which had ten announced battles to its credit,
including the raid on Tokyo, and his long illness
that resulted as well as the serious illness of her
son Melrose, yet she kept her courage and went
forward, doing all she could for her family and
friends. Her own health remained comparatively
- good and she continued to keep very busy.

She passed away rather suddenly at her home
of cardiac failure, Wed. Nov. 1, 1961 at 2 p.m.
She was seventy-nine years eight months and six
days old, She had outlived her husband Arthur
twenty-nine years lacking one month. She was
survived by three sons and two daughters, twelve
grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, five
sisters and two brothers, Funeral services were
held at the Mortuary at 36 East 7th South in Salt
Lake City at 10 a.m. Sat. 4 Nov, 1961 and burial
was later that day in the Manti City Cemetery,
where she was placed beside her beloved husband
Arthur.

Millie's oldest son, Melrose, followed her
in death exactly one week to the day (Wed. 8 Nov.
1961) in Salt Lake City. He was buried exactly a
week following her burial (Sat, 11 Nov. 1961) in

the Mt. Olivet Cemetery there. This was indeed
a sad time for the A. M. Christensen family.

(9) ELVENA CHRISTENSEN (CLARK)

Elvena, eleventh and last child and ninth
producing branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K.
Christensen family, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah 27 Mar. 1887. She was born in the "new rock
house" in northwest Gunnison, According to
information recorded in her mother's journal she
was born about 9 o'clock at night on a Sunday. Her
mother also recorded that she was blessed and
named at home the 7th of April by Norien, (This
last is hard to read and perhaps misspelled.) She
also recorded that the child was taken to church
for her official blessing and naming, 23 Dec. 1889,
which was done by Bishop A. C. Madsen, The
name given her, Elvena, was according to an old
Danish custom of naming children - viz: If the
eighth child was a boy he was named Otto, if the
eleventh child was a girl she was named Elevena,
etc, Elevena was shortened to Elvena in this case
but she was later called ''Vena"' more often than not,

Elvena's mother was a trained doctress and
midwife and her time was much in demand in
Gunnison Valley. Thus the child was often left in
the care of other members of the family. When
she was one year and two months old, her mother
brought home another little baby girl to raise, Ada
Lorena Madsen, two months and twelve days old,
Elvena's mother had delivered the little girl and
taken care of her and her mother during the long
period of the mother's illness. Knowing that she
would die, the young mother had begged the older
woman to take her baby and raise her as her own,
So when Ada's mother passed away, Elvena's
mother brought little Ada to the Christensen home
to live. The two babies, blond, healthy Elvena
and dark haired, sickly little Ada took to each
other right away and became almost inseparable
as the days and years went by,

There was great excitement in Sanpete Valley
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 650

and in fact in the whole of Utah that spring of 1888,
for the beautiful Manti Temple had just been com-
pleted. A three day dedicatorial celebration was
held in the Temple and some in attendance spoke

of hearing ''a heavenly chorus singing" and of other
manifestations of divine approval. The main dedi-
cation service took place 21 May 1888 and the
dedicatory prayer was offered by President Lorenzo
Snow. This was the third holy temple to be dedicated
in Zion and the Saints gathered from all over for the
occasion,

When Elvena was three and a half, Sept. 1890,
her mother left for a three months trip to her native
land of Denmark to visit her relatives who still
resided there. She took little two-and-a-half year
old Ada with her, not daring to leave the frail child
in the care of others for that length of time. If
three-and-a-half year old Elvena's nose was a bit
“out of joint'' because she was left home we could
not entirely blame her. Yet being of so sweet and
loving a disposition she probably "took it in her
stride'' after the first wave of disappointment had
ebbed. Her oldest sister Elsie stayed out of school
those three months to look after things and her father
also helped as well as her thirteen year old sister
Emma, whom Elvena adored. But she must have
been a happy child when her mother and Ada
returned home, about Christmastime that year,
bringing greetings and gifts from cousins in
Denmark,

Ada passed away the winter of 1897, not long
before Vena turned ten, This must have been a sad
experience for Vena since she and Ada had been so
very fond of each other. Being forced to part from
a loved cone can make quite an impression on one of
this age, especially of Vena's sensitive nature--
when the bonds of love have been so closely knit.
Vena missed the little invalid Ada terribly. That
feeling of loss must have been somewhat assuaged,
however, when another little girl who needed a home
was taken in by the Christensens soon after school
started the next fall. Vena's new companion in the
home was Tresia, a little Swedish girl about two
years younger than herself - but wiser in the ways
of the world. She was treated like one of the family
<span id="page-??"></span>
651 Elvena

for, as Tresia herself said, "If Vena got a new
dress I got a new dress and if Vena got new shoes
I got new shoes,'' Tresia remembers that both
she and Vena wore new shoes the night they drove
up to Manti in the two-seated buggy with ''Papa and
Mama" as she called Vena's parents, to attend the
' wedding reception of 'brother Albert'' and his wife
Jennie, 26 Sept. 1900. Vena was thirteen-and-a-
half and Tresia past eleven-and-a-half at the time.
Though quite different in temperament and exper-
ience, these two girls learned to love each other
dearly and established a deep friendship that
existed as long as they both lived.

Vena's two brothers just older, Arthur and
Louis, were great teases and played many pranks
on her; like the time they put her down the well
where she was supposed to hide for a game and
then went off and forgot to bring her back up; and
the time they induced her to lay down in the ditch
where the bridge was supposed to be, to rise up
and frighten their mother when she came at dusk
with the buckets of swill to feed the pigs, but she
got stepped on and doused with the filthy swill
instead; or the time when the boys had been
punished and sent to bed upstairs without their
suppers and they dressed her up like a "poor"!
child, well disguised in a shawl, and sent her to
beg some food from their mother for her "starv-
ing brothers and sisters", but got a good spanking
instead. The guileless Vena was the victim of
their pranks so often that it was surprising she
didn't catch on to them - and perhaps she did after
a time.

Vena attended the public school in Gunnison,
One of her school chums was Rose Bartholomew
(Peterson) recently deceased. Rose said that she
and Vena were almost inseparable in their youth.
They graduated from the eighth grade together and
since there was no high school in Gunnison at the
time this was all the formal schooling that they had.
Vena's brother Joseph was their teacher in eighth
grade and also the Principal.

Vena grew to be a very pretty young woman,
tall and slender with a fair skin, large blue eyes
and the most beautiful, almost golden colored hair.
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 652

I remember at one time my mother Jennie bought

a beautiful piece of gold colored satin for Vena a
dress because it would ''go so well with her lovely
hair'’, On one occasion Vena was chosen as the
"Goddess of Liberty" for a Fourth of July celebra-
tion in Gunnison, for which that town was famous,
and she rode on the main float in the parade, decked
out in a long white flowing robe girded with a long
braided satin cord, and with a golden colored crown
on her upswept, beautifully arranged golden colored
hair, She also sat in state in the patriotic assembly
which followed. Truly she must have been a picture
of loveliness!

In the winter of 1909 her parents sold the rock
house in which she had been born and grown to
womanhood and moved to Manti to be near the
temple, for they were so interested in doing their
genealogy. Vena, still unwed at twenty-two and the
only child at home, moved along with them, She
often used to tell that no matter how old or tall she
had become, her mother Else always introduced her
to new people as her 'baby''. The embarrassed girl
used to counter by saying, "brother Arthur is the
baby boy'', but could never hide her blushes, She
was so timid and modest around strangers.

Vena seldom stayed at home in Manti however,
for she was so much in demand by her sisters and
brothers to assist in their homes and with their
families. She was always so capable and willing
that it is easy to see how she may have been imposed
upon at times by those she loved. We doubt if she
seldom or ever refused or complained. Whenever
there was any need in any of the Christensen fam-
ilies, the call went out for ''Vena''! She was truly
an angel of mercy to each and everyone of them.

In midsummer of 1910 Vena's parents left for
a three months trip to Denmark to visit their rela-
tives and search out more of their genealogy. Her
father still had his only living brother residing there
whom he had not seen in forty-four years, or since
before he left the Old Country the spring of 1866,

before and established a close relationship once
again with her three Danish sisters and one brother
and their families living there. They had corres-

ponded often during those twenty years, When they
learned that 'Aunt Else'' was returning to Denmark
some of Vena's Danish girl cousins about her age
wrote begging that ''Cousin Elvena" be allowed to
come along. What could have been more wonderful
than for Vena to have made this trip to Denmark
with her parents, especially since her brother
Andrew and his family were also going? Why she
didn't go we do not know. Perhaps she was too
timid, not knowing the Danish language, but more
likely it was because of the great expense of such
a trip.

That autumn, while her parents were still
away, Vena's brother Albert's family was stricken
with scarlet fever. The daughter Elaine came down
with it just as they were preparing to move into a
lovely new home in Manti. They had sold their old
home so Elaine was taken by her mother to her
grandfather Snow's home where they were both
quarantined in for some weeks, Vena's help was
sought and she accepted the responsibility of being
quarantined in with the other three children, Vir-
ginia, Sherman and Hale, nine, five-and-a-half
and three-and-a-half respectively. Albert rented
a large furnished room in a dilapidated rock house
belonging to old Mr, Henry that stood just across.
the fence south of the new house and into this moved
Vena and the three children, Albert was of course
quarantined out of both places, because of his work,
but took care of the extra needs of all,

How well I recall being penned up in that long,
dark room with our beds at one end, a cooking
stove, cupboards and makeshift sink at the other,
and a large round table in between where we ate
our meals and carried on many of our other
activities, This table was centered by a large
fancy kerosene lamp and here Aunt Vena played
solitaire with cards in the evenings after the little
boys had gone to bed, while I worked at pencil
games or read a book, How Aunt Vena loved to
play solitaire! But her sunny disposition and
cheerful ways brightened our lives and kept us
mostly contented in our locked-in condition. The
brightest time of all each day, however, was when
Daddy came with our groceries and special treats
<span id="page-??"></span>

for all. Happily none of us took the disease so we
were able to move out of there and into our new
home as soon as the quarantine was lifted.

Vena had worked at the woolen mills in Provo
for a short time several years before, when Andrew
and Sarah lived there, and stayed at their place; but
she had never really been "away to work", Tresia
had left the Christensen home to go to work in Salt
Lake City when she was sixteen and never returned
except for visits, The tales of her escapades must
have given Vena a longing to see something of the
big city, make her own money and spend it on
luxuries and be independent as it were, Tresia
always had such beautiful bonnets, shoes, dresses
and rustling silk petticoats when she came back to
visit,

It must have been soon after her parents had
returned from Europe that Vena gained their con-
sent to go to Salt Lake City to find employment,

She could live with Caroline, the wife of her brother
Chris, since Caroline was in need of adult company
at nights, Chris being away much of the time on
Bennion Livestock Company business for he was
the manager. Vena got a job at the Hotel Utah
working in the linen room and here she was em-
ployed for several years, Doubtless she had been
duly cautioned beforehand by her mother and others
to 'beware of strangers - especially males", for
Tresia says that during all the time she worked at
the hotel she never spoke to the male guests if she
could help it nor ever once touched the boxes of
candy and money they left for her as tips. She
possessed a moral integrity that could not be
questioned. Some may have called her ''old
fashioned" but she should have been envied by the
less scrupulous.

She eventually gave up her work at the Hotel
Utah and went where she was most needed among
members of her family - to be with Elsie and her
children on the ranch in Wyoming - to help Emma
bottle fruit or cook for threshers - to be with
Albert's motherless children when his wife Jennie
passed away in 1916. Fortunate is the family who
has an ''Aunt Vena'' to love and care for them in
times of need! Her numerous nieces and nephews
<span id="page-??"></span>

all learned to adore her without exception and with
good cause,

But Vena longed for children of her own. Her
brother Chris ''I'' was largely responsible in getting
her interested in a fine fellow about her age named
George T, Clark - and in getting George interested
in Vena. George had worked for Chris for a num-
ber of years as one of the herders of the Bennion
Livestock Company and he had found him to be
honest, hard working, clean living and most
dependable, besides having a very kind disposition
and being a bachelor, Chris felt that George would
make an excellent husband for Vena, who was press-
ing thirty, and he had a great desire to see his
youngest sister happily married.

George was a native of Upton, Utah, and as
a company herder must have often gone to the Com-
pany ranch in Upton for supplies when Vena's brother
was operating that ranch. Whether Vena ever met
George while visiting Arthur and Millie at Upton we
cannot be certain, Arthur and family left Upton the
autumn of 1915 and moved back to Gunnison, and
Vena seemed to have no visions of a prospective.
marriage at the time she was taking care of her
brother Albert's motherless children in 1916/17,
or she would have told them. She was still at
Albert's the middle of June 1917, as attested to by
the following excerpt from Elaine's journal dated
16 June 1917: - ''We've worked hard carrying
benches, tables, Victrola and lights out to the
lawn for our lawn party. Dear Aunt Vena has
worked so hard cooking and sewing for us. , , '!

It must have been very soon after that, how-
ever, that Vena left Manti and went to the ranch in
Wyoming to visit her sister Elsie and children and
others of her relatives living there. Chris had
helped her file on some homestead land close to
the others on The Oasis and she was supposed to
live on it a certain part of each year and make
improvements on it as Louis, Elsie and others
were doing. Her brother Chris, the sly one, must
have taken this opportunity to get Vena and George
Clark together somehow and the spark was lighted.
Their romance grew rapidly, fostered by Chris
and the others, and it was not many weeks before
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 656
Vena and George had decided to get married,

They went to the Uinta county seat at Evanston,
Wyoming for their license and were married there
by the L. D, S, Bishop, 14 Aug. 1917. Both were
thirty at the time. Much of the credit for this mar-
riage could be given to the cupid with reddish
whiskers, Chris 'I"'", His daughter Pearl says that
the couple went to Salt Lake City right after their
marriage and spent the first night of their honey-
moon at her mother Caroline's home. She remem-
bers her mother telling about the large straw hat
Vena was wearing, trimmed with a large bunch of
gay colored artificial flowers, Somehow during the
night the cat got hold of that hat and tore it all to
pieces, and that was the end of Vena's wedding
bonnet.

From Salt Lake they went on to Manti where
Vena showed George off to her Sanpete County rela-
tives, Then it was back to The Oasis in Wyoming,
where they lived with Elsie while George built a
house on Vena's property, a two-roomed log house
with an attic. Chris gave George work on or near
the ranch so that he could be near his new bride.
George helped with the harvesting of the crops on
Chris' place that fall and he was there when the
crops were burned and, shortly afterwards, when
the wonderful Chris "I'' was shot and died, He
helped a great deal at that time.

Vena must have gone home to live with her
parents that winter in Manti while George went out
again with the sheep, Returning to Wyoming in
early spring she was able to live in her own log
house, which was not too far from her sister
Elsie's or her brother Louis' log and frame houses,
George was able to be home off and on but by July
Vena had returned to Manti to be near the help of
her mother for the birth of her first child.

Vera was born in Manti at the home of her
Christensen grandparents, 12 July 1918, and was
delivered by her grandmother Else, Tresia says
Vena had a very hard time of it. She took baby
Vera back up on the Oasis in Wyoming to live as
soon as she was able, for she wanted to ''prove up"
on her land. It wasn't too long after the end of that

year that the Bennion Livestock Company was sold
and all of the Christensens, except Louis and his
family, had sold or givei. up their land there and
left the area.

That winter (1918/19) Vena went again to
live with her parents in Manti and it was perhaps
the next spring that George joined her there. They
were encouraged to stay on in Utah and Vena's
brother Albert gave George work on his Gunnison
ranch, a mile or so west of Gunnison. There was
plenty for George to do looking after the feeding of
the sheep and cattle on the ranch, He and Vena
and small Vera lived at Vena's sister Emma's that
winter and it was at the Peterson home that their
second child, Alta, was born(Feb. 1921). In the
spring of 1921 George and Vena and their two little
girls moved into the small farm house on the Gunni-
son ranch and it was here that their third daughter,
Tresia, was born in May 1922, Emma took care
of one year old Alta for them at that time. There
was always so much love between Emma and Vena
that they could scarcely help each other enough,

In her own history their oldest daughter,
Vera Clark (Lyons) recalls some of the things she
has been told about life on that Gunnison ranch: --
"Ivan Lyons! folks were also farming west of
Gunnison, for the Mellors, and my folks and his
visited back and forth and played cards together.
They would do the chores at night, get out the
horse and wagon, then, taking us children with
them, go and spend the night at Lyons visiting
and playing cards while we slept, then go back
home next morning in time to do the chores again.
Lyons' boy Ivan, two and a half years older than
I, . tried to lift me over a ditch once and dropped
me into the water, He remembers this well be-
cause his Dad gave him a licking for it. I was not
much more than four at the time. (Ivan Lyons
later became Vera's husband),

The summer of 1922 Albert gave George
work on the Star Ranch north of Nephi and that
fall George moved his family to Goshen, not far
north of there, and went to work in the mines at
Dividend, Utah, where his brother-in-law, Alma
Bartholomew, had employment. Alma and Elsie
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 658

also lived in Goshen, Vera writes: ''The folks
rented a place in Goshen across from the George
Burraston family who were always fine neighbors
and have always been good friends ever since. Dad
finally bought a little home across the road from
mother's sister and her husband, Aunt Elsie and
Uncle Alma Bartholomew. "'

It was in Goshen that Vena gave birth to her
fourth daughter, LaFay, Sept. 1923, and it was
there in Nov. 1924 that their first son, George
Fern Clark, was born. Two years later, in Nov.
of 1926, another daughter, Lorraine, was born to
Vena and George. This was a difficult winter for
them because the children had so much sickness.
Vera writes of this: - ''The year I was in the third
grade was a tough one for us. We had measles,
mumps, chicken pox, and also scarlet fever. I had

scarlet fever and LaFay had measles at the same
time. Mother said the doctor came every day to.
see both of us but he thought I was going to die and
that LaFay would get well, but it turned out just the
opposite, for LaFay took pneumonia and passed
away 24 Feb. 1927, I remember the morning she
died. Alta and I were awake and mother wrapped
us in quilts and took us into the room where she
lay. We were under quarantine and the only one
who could leave the place was Dad, He went to
work, did our shopping and all. —

"LaFay's funeral services were held on our
lawn and they placed her casket just inside the
front door. It was the last of February and very
cold and mother sat weeping with us children all
around her wrapped up in quilts and three-and-a-
half month old Lorraine on her lap. None of us
were able to go to the cemetery because of the
quarantine, except Dad who took her to the Goshen
Cemetery and buried her, with the help of relatives
and neighbors who had gathered for the occasion, "'

One more child, a second boy named LaMar,
was born to Vena and George in Goshen, There
were happy times along with the sad times there.
Vera writes: - 'I can remember mother and dad
going to dances now and again in Goshen, They |
took me to a Valentine's dance once where the
women brought box lunches and the men drew for
<span id="page-??"></span>
659 Elvena

them. Mother and Dad both loved to dance and
Dad was an especially good dancer. When I grew
older the dance I had with him at every dance we
both attended was the thrill of the evening."

Vera continues: - ''We moved to Santaquin
on April Ist 1930, just before I finished sixth
grade, but Iwas still promoted. Dad had bought
a lot there with no house on it, so we rented a
house on the same block until he could build on
it. He moved the big garage from our place in
Goshen onto our lot in Santaquin. It made two
rooms into which we moved, Later he added
other rooms," Tresia writes: - 'In my second
year of school we moved to Santaquin. I remember
spending hours and hours moving rocks from the
ground before Dad could plant a garden. We rented
until enough of our own house was finished for us
to move in. Then we only had lanterns to see by at
nights for some weeks and I remember how wonder-
ful it seemed when we got electricity into the house."

Mary Gledhill Dowdle said that the Christen-
sen and Gledhill girls were always close friends
through the years, as were the Christensens and
Bartholomews. Mary lived in Payson while Vena
lived in Santaquin and she says while living in
Santaquin that Vena used to entertain her neighbors
and friends at a program and musical regularly
every month in her home, Although none of their
children had any musical talent to speak of, George
bought her a piano more or less for these occasions,
Vena loved music, as did her sisters Elsie and
Emma, and though she never had any special
training she taught herself to play the piano some,
Mary said that Vena loved people and that her
sweet ways and thoughtfulness of others endeared
her to all who knew her. Mary also said that Vena
attended Relief Society and other church meetings
faithfully and that she had one of the fondest dreams
of her life realized when George took her to the -
"House of the Lord" and they and their six younger
children were sealed for time and eternity. (An-
other daughter, Viola, had been born in Payson in
June 1931, about a year after they moved to
Santaquin, )

Vena was the only one of the Christensen

brothers and sisters who hadn't yet had her temple
work done and this had worried her more as time
went on and the children grew older. It took a near
tragedy in George's and Vena's lives, however, to
get them to the temple, Tresia tells of this: -
"The spring my oldest sister Vera was married
(Apr. 1938) on Easter Sunday, Iwas with a group
of young friends in a car when we had a terrible
accident. I was badly injured and not expected to
live for a time, my face being cut almost from
ear to ear and other damage. Iwas unconscious
for quite a period and the first time 1 saw my
father, after regaining consciousness, I told him
that I was concerned that he and mother had not
been to the temple to be sealed for eternity. This
seemed to be constantly on my mind after the acci-
dent and I remembered mother worrying about my
sisters Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she
and Dad had us children sealed to them, I exacted
a promise from Dad at that time that they would
prepare to go to the temple before my eighteenth
birthday,

"My parents did prepare themselves and
were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in
Manti and have their temple work done and us
younger children sealed to them for eternity, the
very day before my eighteenth birthday - 27 May
1940. I know how happy they will be when all of
their children are sealed to them and we can be
together as a family in the world where they have
gone. They made many sacrifices for us and the
least we can do now for them is to prepare our-
selves by righteous living to join them in the
eternity."

Vera writes: - ''Mother and Dad went through
the Manti Temple the day before Tresia's eighteenth
birthday and had the six younger children sealed to
them, Alta and I were too old at the time, Cousins
Byron and Mildred went through the temple with
them and then they all came over to Ephraim where
Ivan, I and our first son were living at the time and
I had dinner ready for them. Byron brought ice
cream for everyone for the occasion. Mildred said
she bet I'd never dreamed that I'd be cooking my
parents' wedding dinner someday!"

When World War II came along, their oldest
son George went into the service. He became a
gunner on a bomb squad flying missions over Ger-
many, On his tenth bombing mission his plane was
shot down over Germany and all the crew killed
except George, who was wounded and taken prisoner.
For seven months he was listed as "missing in
action" and his family had no idea whether he was
dead or alive. This must have been a real ordeal
for Vena and George and their family. But George
Jr., by the grace of a higher power, returned home
safe and well,

Vena's husband George passed away 12 Apr.
1951, They had been married going on thirty-four
years, nearly thirty years of which he had worked
in the mines, He had retired from the mines and
was trying his hand at herding sheep again when he
became ill and was brought home. Vera writes: -
"The day Dad died he had the Elders in to adminis-
ter to him. They promised him a good nights rest.
Later he sent mother out of the room to get him
something andwhen she returned he was dead, !!
George was buried beside little LaFay in the Goshen
cemetery. Vena received some compensation,
following his death, from the Industrial Com-
mission because he died of "miners consumption".

Besides helping to raise her brothers' and
sisters' children and her own seven, Vena raised
a grandson, Terry, as long as she was able, since
his mother, Alta, had to work for a living away
from home, Left a widow, Vena continued to
spend much of her time in Santaquin but visited
around and stayed with her married children
occasionally, especially Tresia. She had enjoyed
comparatively good health throughout her life,
although at one time in her earlier years a doctor
said she had a breast cancer, Her family fasted
and prayed for her and the suspicious looking lump
disappeared, In middle age Vena became very
heavy. It was probably this extreme overweight
that caused the troubles and discouragement and
the painful arthritis in her head, neck and shoulders
that she suffered about the last year of her life.

_ When it came to the point that she needed a
lot of special care, it was impossible for her
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 662

children to do what was needed - though they did

all they could, She was placed in a rest home in
Payson for a short while but was unhappy there
because none of her children were near, So she
was moved to a rest home in Salt Lake City and
was only there a very short time when she passed
away, 5 July 1956, at sixty-nine years three months
and eight days, She had outlived her husband George >
a little over two months and four years,

Vena Christensen Clark's body rested in state
in a lovely casket in her home in Santaquin, sur-
rounded by flowers, Hundreds of relatives and
friends came to view her and later to honor her at
a beautiful memorial service in the Ward chapel
there. She was laid to rest in the Goshen cemetery
8 July 1956 beside her dear husband and her small
daughter LaFay,

So after death they came to see ''Aunt Vena",
relatives, nieces and nephews, as they had sought
her out in love in couples, groups or individually
as long as she lived and wherever she lived. She
had long been a favorite with them all. One of her
nieces, Elaine Christensen (Southwick) wrote a
tribute to her which will perhaps find an echo in
the hearts of all who knew and loved her, She
titles it, of course, ''Aunt Vena'!: -

"Perhaps my remembered image of Aunt
Vena is like Standhal's idea of "'crystalization",
He claims that we do not see a person we really
love as she actually is but endow her with qualities
that she does not actually possess. 'In the salt
mines! he says, ‘it is possible to leave a dead
branch - a black and ugly piece of wood - and to
find next morning when one returns that it has
become covered with salt crystals and is now a
glittering object which is a delight to behold,' So
maybe in my mind I have adorned Aunt Vena with
-a whole 'array of glittering crystals' which she
may not have possessed - but this Idoubt. Rather,
I may not have given her due credit for all she was
to me when she came to live with us after mother's
death.

"T remember very little of her before that
time and might have forgotten more had I not been

writing a journal while she was at our home. One
of the most outstanding things about Aunt Vena was
her chameleon ability to be any given age at any
required time. Although in years she numbered
almost thirty against my fourteen, we shared
secrets, activities and like heart pangs. Besides
providing me and my friends with home made
bread, thick cream and sugar for an after school
snack, she also provided a sounding board and a
sympathetic understanding of my restless teen-
age fancies,

"As I look back through the eyes of exper-
ience, I can now know how tired she must have
been from all of our varied demands, how lonely
for love and attention from friends her own age,
and yet how patient, understanding and available
she was for our diversified family needs, I know
that she showed a great compassion for all of us
and that she was especially close to little Phillip
as she must have also been to mother. That
mother had adored her for her sweetness, gentle-
ness and selflessness I have no doubt, She had
admired the glint of Aunt Vena's spun gold hair;
and in hopes that Virginia and I might possess a
like adornment, she had us brush our locks one
hundred strokes a day in the sunshine.. Mother
had believed in the philosophy of the Great Stone
Face and had us try to emulate the benign and
guileless expression Aunt Vena had.

"Aunt Vena, bowing before the perplexity
of problems attendant to caring for five mother-
less children, often dreamed of mother, for she
told us so. She saw her in teaching situations of
all kinds, and yet she seemed always to nod
encouragement and approval at Aunt Vena who
stood humbly on this side of the veil, seeking
help. She did so want to please 'Jennie', Aunt
Vena slept inthe Blue Room with four year old
Phillip, who clung to her as a substitute for his»
mother. One morning just at dawn she awoke to
see little Phil smiling and nodding at someone who
seemed to be leaving the room, Upon asking Phil
who the visitor was he replied, ‘I've been talking
to my mama,.' That Aunt Vena herself at times
lived close to the angels, I have never doubted,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 664

"She was loved by all members of her family,
young and old alike, but because of her lack of sub-
terfuge and her child-like qualities she was often
a butt for family pranks when she was a girl. She
used to entertain us children with stories of the
escapades she experienced with her brothers just
older, and other unusual happenings in her girlhood.
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when she told
about the time she had saved up extra eggs enough
to buy a coveted blouse. She told of carrying the
eggs in a basket and, accompanied by grandmother,
going carefully up the weed bordered sidewalk to-
ward town. As they came to a wooden bridge,
spanning an irrigation ditch, they stepped simultan-
eously upon a loose board, Aunt Vena, who weighed
less than grandmother, flew into the air and landed
on, in and under the ill-fated eggs.

"In appearance during her married years I
remember her as large, comfortable and expres-
sive. Her eyes were light blue and readily showed
every expression she felt. Smile crinkles bordered
her eyes and smile wrinkles deepened the corners
of her mouth that sometimes pouted in mock severity.
She had a slight impediment in her speech (lisping,
I think) but it didn't stop the volubility of expressed
love and concern for all of the children and grand-
children of hers and those of her 'dear brothers and
sisters'. Her appelation for her family was always
prefixed by 'dear'. It was 'dear brother Albert or
dear brother Joseph, or Andrew, or Chris, or
Louis, or Arthur', And it was 'dear sister Ada,
or Emma, or Elsie, or Tresia.' Her heart was
as big as her family and was the pivot around which
the family news circulated. She was an excellent
letter writer. She treasured the letters, cards,
pictures and clippings anyone sent her and she was
eager to pass on any family news she received,

"Although I saw very little of Aunt Vena dur-
ing her last years, Ido know that her children
honored and loved her and that everyone who knew
her spoke of her with endearing admiration, To
me she will always be a dear and cherished entity
crystalized into a glittering object endowed with
empathy, charity, trust, and a child-like faith in
life, humanity and God, which made her a delight

George Thomas Clark, husband of Elvena
Christensen, was born 6 June 1887 in Upton,
Summit, Utah. His parents were early Mormon.
pioneers of Upton, from England, William Rolland
and Amelia Frances Smith Clark. He spent his
early boyhood in Upton and attended the public
schools that were available there. But it was
necessary for him to work hard, for Upton was
a frontier town and the people were mostly poor
and had to struggle for a living.

Upton, first called ''Up From Town!" because
of the altitude and distance from Coalville, which
was settled first, is still fourteen miles from
Coalville. The elevation is still the same, about
7,000 ft.; the winters are still long; only the name
has been shortened, Starvation, cold and disease
stared grimly at the first settlers there 105 years
ago. Deep snows softened the stark brush and
rock covered slopes but made foraging difficult
for farm and wild game animals, Clearing acreage
for planting had been difficult and the pioneers had
realized only a little barley, oats and a few potatoes
from a summer of hard labor. A few rabbits and
an occasional elk supplemented their meager diet,
and one family was forced to empty the straw from
their beds to keep the family cow alive through the
long dreary months.

Coalville was first settled in 1859 by a few
settlers who were attracted by the good farmland
at the confluence of Chalk Creek and the Weber
River. That same year coal was discovered along
Chalk Creek and more families flocked to this high
country. Isaac Burton and John Stanley followed
Chalk Creek still higher into the mountains and
cleared some land and built a pole fence around it.
In 1861 Joseph Huff came, saw the land and
exchanged a cow for it. That summer he harvested
a crop of wild hay and built a cabin. In early 1863
others began trickling in and soon more than 40
families called Upton home.

Slowly they cleared the land and brought
<span id="page-??"></span>

irrigation streams from nearby creeks, Oxen

and mules were used for plowing. In addition to
farming, some worked small coal mines, some
hauled logs to Park City, Salt Lake City and
Evanston, Wyoming. Much of this land is still in
the families of those Upton pioneers - Boyers,
Clarks, Saxtons, Meadows, Stayleys, Powells.
Most of them were converts to the Church of

Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and some, includ-
ing the Clarks, were from England, They recorded
baptisms in Chalk Creek through holes chopped in
the ice in winter months. They built a church, a
school and a fine amusement hall.

These Upton pioneers not only built their own
houses but they built their own furniture as well.
They whitewashed the walls of their log cabins with
lime and added board floors that were scrupulously
cleaned with homemade lye soap. They made their
own shoes and much of their clothing. They raised
gardens, raspberries and rhubarb. They trapped
beaver from nearby streams and lakes and they
even took time out to fight Indians, if that happened
to be necessary. They held community dances and
other celebrations and had their fun on homemade
sleds in winters,

There were lots of Clarks in Upton and all of
them were related to George. His grandmother
Clark came from England to Upton. His grand-
father and grandmother Clark came and settled in
Upton. His father and mother were married in
Upton, Some of them had come there as early as
1869. His grandfather's brother, Frank Clark who
was an artist, painted murals on ali four walls of
the large Upton recreation hall which people from
all around came there to see, Yes, George had
lots of relatives who had settled in Upton; for
besides his grandparents there were aunts and
uncles, great aunts and great uncles and cousins
by the dozens,

George's father and mother lived in Upton —
for some years and then moved into Wyoming for
another few years but returned again to live in
Upton, It was here that the majority of their ten
children were born, Tragedy struck the family in
1904 however, when George was néaring seventeen,

GEORGE AND VENA'S CHILDREN

667 Elvena

His mother gave birth to her tenth child on March
12th of that year but the little. one died on the 14th
and the mother died on the 18th of the effects of
that childbirth. The next youngest child, age two,
passed away the end of that month, and as if this
weren't enough for the family to bear, the father
was rushed to Coalville with bloodpoisoning the
forepart of April and died there. There were less
than three weeks between the deaths of George's
parents, four of the family dying in less than a
month.

George was next to the oldest of the seven
remaining children, a third child of ten having
died in 1900. His daughter Vera writes: - ''There
were seven children left in the family and they
were soon scattered among the various relatives
or anyone that would take them, Dad had no school
after that and was shifted around among two or
three different uncles at one time or another, as
they were able to use him in farming or with the
sheep, He eventually ended up herding sheep for
the Bennion Livestock Company and it was through
the manager of that company, Chris "I'' Christen-
sen, that he met his future wife, Elvena."'

George was two months and ten days younger
than Elvena. Vera tells that during April and May
of each year her father used to tease her mother
about being the "oldest" in the family, saying he
was sure glad that he wasn't as old as she or that
he's surely hate to be the oldest, or some such.
But nearly thirty-four happily married years
came out of that marriage and eight lovely child-
ren, seven of whom grew to maturity, married and
had children of their own. They have a good sized
posterity today.

George was rather small of stature, slightly
shorter than Elvena. But he was tall in the things
that mattered most - honesty, industry, charity,
goodwill - there is not room here to name all of
his good qualities, He was a kind and loving
husband and a good father, He was not able to
provide his family with many luxuries but their
home was one of peace, understanding and love.
He had many talents even though he had had little
training and few opportunities. He loved music
<span id="page-??"></span>
Elvena 668

and used to play for dances in Upton and that area
before he was married. They say he played the
banjo well, was excellent on the harmonica, could
chord on the organ and piano, and could sure play
the mandolin like a professional. Though he had
never had a music lesson in his life he could play
any piece of music that the dance band played.

George worked in the mines in Juab County
for almost thirty years, In fact, he worked there
until the mines closed down about 1950. Ata
large celebration held in Payson, honoring men of
long and outstanding service to mining at that
time, George was presented with a pin for his fine
contribution. But he worked in the mines too long
as far as his health was concerned. Breathing the
poor air and dust in the mines so long brought on
silicosis which caused his death, 12 Apr. 1951, at
age sixty-four years ten months and six days,

George was buried 16 Apr. 1951 in the Goshen
cemetery. Two weeks later, upon the advice of
and after serious consultation with his doctor, a
lawyer, and his mother who was hard to convince,
his son George arranged to have his father's body
exhumed and an autopsy performed to prove the
nature of the condition that caused his death.
From the report of those who examined him it was
possible to file a claim with the Industrial Com-
mission which eventually paid his mother a lump
sum plus small monthly payments thereafter,
which helped her so much at that time. But an
unusual thing happened during the time the body
was being examined. Some of George senior's
own relatives, who had been unable to attend his
funeral, came to the Goshen cemetery to visit his
grave and found nothing but a gaping hole beside
his marker. They immediately called on Vena and
made things very difficult for her at the time.

669 Ada
(10) FOSTER CHILDREN

(a) Ada Lorena Madsen, daughter of Victor
August Hastrup Madsen, adopted son of Bishop
Christian August Madsen of Gunnison and his wife
Sarah Olesen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah 14 Mar. 1888. Ada was the fifth child and
fourth daughter born to this couple, Else K,
Christensen was the midwife who assisted with her
birth and also cared for her and her mother during
the time of the mother's illness which followed.
Ada was born with a malfunctioning heart and was
very frail herself, needing special care,

Knowing that she could not live long, twenty-
seven year old Sarah Madsen exacted a promise
from Else K. Christensen that she would take her
baby daughter after she passed away and raise her
as her own. Else promised, Sarah Madsen died
25 May 1888 and was buried in the Gunnison ceme-
tery a few days later beside a baby daughter,
Almira, who had passed away some six years
before at two years of age.

Sarah Madsen died on Friday and her baby
daughter hadn't been given a name yet. But she
was blessed and given the name Ada Lorena Madsen
the day after her mother's death, Sat. 26 May 1888,
in the home and Else K, Christensen took the little
two month twelve day old invalid to her home to
raise as her own, as promised. Though the father,
Victor A. Madsen, would not consent to Laurs and
Else adopting his daughter, she having been sealed
to him and his wife in the Covenant, yet he consented
to them calling her by the surname of Christensen
as long as she was with them and gave them a signed
statement to that effect,

Much of the rest of Ada's story has been told
in earlier pages of this book - the love she was
given and the sunshine she brought into the Chris-
tensen home - her trip to Denmark at two-and-a-
half years of age with her foster mother - her
untimely death within two months and a few days
of her ninth birthday, 3 Jan. 1897. She was bap-
tized a member of the LDS Church 21 July 1896.

A little more than ten years following her death,
<span id="page-??"></span>
Ada 670

Laurs and Else had her endowments taken care of
in the Manti Temple, 22 Feb, 1907.

Ada was buried on the Madsen plot beside her
mother in the Gunnison cemetery. Her tombstone
bears the following inscription: - "In loving memory
of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and Sarah
Madsen - Born 14 Mar., 1888 - Died 3 Jan, 1897 -
In sore distress your life has past -,You loved us
all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and
Else K. Christensen, ''. Less than eleven months
after Ada's death her natural father, forty-two year
old Victor August Madsen, joined the others of the
little group resting there on the Madsen plot in
Gunnison cemetery. He died 16 Nov. 1897 and was
survived by his second wife and a son and two daugh-
ters by his first wife.

(B) Anna Theresa Carlson, daughter of Carl
Gustaf Carlson and Hulda Charlotte (or Caroline)
Karlsdotter or Karlson, was born 9 Feb. 1889 in
Fjarstad, Ostergotland, Sweden, She was chris-
tened (dobt) in the Swedish church there, 24 Feb,
1889, She was called by her second name, the.
spelling of which was eventually chortened to
Tresia,

When Tresia was going on four years old her
father took his own life. Her mother, left without
means of support, was forced to return to the
home of her aged father to live taking Tresia with
her. Soon another little girl was born to the young
widow and Tresia had a baby sister, Edith. The
old grandfather, however, made things altogether
miserable for the three of them, but especially
Tresia's young mother, complaining over every
crust of bread that went into the mouths of her
little ones,

Tresia's mother was contacted by Mormon
missionaries and soon joined the LDS Church, 5
Apr. 1894, becoming a member of the Linkoping
Branch there in Sweden. At this her father became
éven more concerned with the "extra little mouths
to feed'' and the unhappy mother knew hardly what
to do or where to turn.
<span id="page-??"></span>

<span id="page-??"></span>
671 Tresia

Long before, Tresia's father's father had
passed away when her father was very young and
his mother married a Mr. Newren, said to have
been a musician, and by him she had at least two
sons, Tresia's father's half brothers, Family
tradition claims that Mr. Newren was accidently
drowned when crossing a stream late one evening
while returning from a dance at which he had been
the fiddler, Be that as it may, Tresia's grand-
mother, the widow Newren, joined the LDS Church
and, together with her two sons, emigrated to
America and Zion, Later she died in Utah and
Tresia's mother received a small sum of money
from the grandmother's estate, as her husband's
portion in behalf of his children,

At this time Tresia's mother, encouraged
by the Mormon missionaries, was herself planning
to emigrate to Zion as soon as she could get the
means. She decided to use the children's small
legacy to send her oldest daughter, Tresia, to stay
with one of her husband's half brothers in Utah until
she and the younger daughter could join her. So
Tresia left Sweden by ship, in company with a
returning Mormon missionary and his Swedish
bride, the autumn of 1895, enroute to Zion and
her half-uncle Mr. Newren's home in Salt Lake
City. Little Swedish Tresia was going on seven
at the time and could speak no English. Mr. New-
ren was a polygamist with two wives and two
separate families. Times were hard and money
was scarce and with many mouths to feed, Tresia
was not overly welcome. She stayed with Mr.
Newren's one family in Salt Lake for awhile and
then was sent to Scofield in Carbon County to live
with his other wife and family, where she remained
for about a year, In the meantime the first wife
and family had moved to Gunnison, Sanpete County
and Tresia was sent to live with them again, Then
these Newrens left Gunnison and she ended up living
with an elderly couple in Centerfield who were no
relation as far as she knew and whose names she
soon forgot.

Tresia was baptized a member of the LDS
Church 31 July 1897, while living in Centerfield,
She had never attended school up to this point so
<span id="page-??"></span>
Tresia 672

was sent to school in Centerfield when it opened in
the fall. She went to school taking a sandwich of
dried bread spread with bacon grease for her lunch.
She remembers being hungry most of the time,
School in Centerfield was short lived for Tresia
however, for after a few days of it she wandered
away several miles into north Gunnison and became
lost - and nobody came to find her.

She spent that night sleeping on the steps of
the Relief Society hall in northwest Gunnison. We
have learned previously in this book how she ended
up next day at the home of Laurs and Else K,
Christensen and how they decided to give her a
home, saying, ''One more mouth won't make any
difference.'' Tresia writes: - "After I had been
shifted around from one family to another for two
years, the Christensens took me in, It reads like
a book. They were so wonderful tome. There
are no words written or spoken that are good
enough to describe them. They treated me as
their own - God bless them! The rest of the
Christensen family was grand to me also."'

Tresia took the surname of Christensen while
she lived with Laurs and Else and their family.
She started school in the first grade in Gunnison
when she was going on nine and atteded there
through the seventh grade. She left and went to
Salt Lake City to work just before she turned
sixteen, so she lived with the Christensens for
somewhat more than six years, She always kept
in touch with them, however, and deemed them
"her family", returning to visit them on occasions
as long as any of them lived. Even today she keeps
in touch with their children, for she is still living
at age eighty in Maricopa, California (1969).

Tresia worked at various things in Salt Lake
City. She was a nursemaid for awhile and then did
housework. She worked in different cafes and had
a good job in a store at one time. After some six
years of working around like this she met and
married a man by the name of William H. Scott.
They were married in Salt Lake City, 11 June 1911,
when she was twenty-two. Mr. Scott owned a drug-
store in Blackfoot, Idaho and took Tresia there to
live. But William drank and the couple's marriage
<span id="page-??"></span>
673 Tresia
ended in divorce in December of that same year.

Following her divorce Tresia went from
Idaho to Oakland, California and worked there for
nearly two years. Then she moved to Dillon,
Montana to work, Here she met a bachelor ten
years older than she, by the name of James Lacy.
The two went to Evanston, Wyoming to be married,
3 July 1917. Tresia called her new husband Jim
and he was lacking five months of being thirty-eight
when they were wed and she was five months past
twenty-eight, They lived in Dillon, Montana for
five more years where Jim worked for a lumber
company and an ice company. They then went to
Delano, California for a year and a half, where he
worked as a mason, Taft, California became their
home next for about a year and a half and here Jim
worked building schools and as a steam fitter. The
oil fields in Maricopa nearby furnished him with
his next employment and here they lived and worked
for the next seventeen years, Jim then worked in
the oil fields at Taft for three and a half years, but
they continued to live at Maricopa. It was in Mari-
copa that Jim died of a heart attack, 4 Feb. 1946,
and thus ended more than twenty-eight and a half
years of a very happy marriage. Tresia wrote: -
"Jim Lacy was a wonderful man and he was grand
to me," a

Tresia continued to live on in Maricopa and
here she became acquainted with a widower by the
name of Ray H. Moore. On4 May 1951 the two
went to Las Vegas, Nevada and were married.
Tresia writes: - ''TRay Moore was also a very
good man and kind to me, We had been married
just a little over two years when he died of a heart
attack, 30 May 1953. He had three children by his
first wife and through them I now claim nine grand-
children and eight great-grandchildren who are
also very kind to me,"

Tresia, very pretty as a girl and a beautiful
woman even at eighty years of age (1969), never
had any children of her own. But she is surrounded
by those who love her for she is gracious, friendly,
outgoing and greatly admired. She still lives in
Maricopa, California, keeping her own apartment
but sharing cooking responsibilities with a lady
<span id="page-??"></span>
Tresia 674

friend next door, with whom she says she "has a
ball", Though her eyes are rather poor now and
she is forced to use a cane some, yet she gets
around among her friends and enjoys life,

For a number of years after Ray Moore's
death she made a yearly trip to Salt Lake City
each autumn by bus and stayed with her cousin
Della Newren Rudy in Salt Lake City for several
weeks. At these times she visited around in Salt
Lake and Provo with the descendants of Laurs and
Else K. Christensen, to the fourth generation, She
attended several Christensen family reunions. She
is the only person now living that ever dwelt inti-
mately with Laurs and Else and their family. She
has added so many ''memories'' to the pages of
this book,

Perhaps the happiest event in Tresia's later
years took place 12 Oct. 1965, when she went to
the Salt Lake Temple for her own endowments and
was sealed to her second husband, James Lacy, for
all eternity. She is now waiting hopefully for the
opportunity to go again to the temple and be sealed
to her own father and mother, together with her
deceased sister Edith. Their temple ordinances
are now being taken care of in preparation for this
holy work, May she be thus blessed! Someday she
will meet again with those she once knew and loved,
as we shall meet our loved ones, on the other side
of the veil.

PART SIX

THEIR NUMEROUS GRANDCHILDREN
AND THEIR DESCENDANTS

"We have come by way of the trials and
errors, the anxieties, hopes, pathos, and
strivings of others - We have been given so
much for which we have paid so little."

--Richard L, Evans

Laurs M. C. and Else K, Christensen had
sixty-seven grandchildren, A history of each is
included in this part of the book, Fifty-one of
them were living when the writing of it was begun;
four have passed away since, In order to save
space and repetition each grandchild's name in
the beginning will be followed by a number denoting
the branch of the family to which he or she belongs;
viz: Christian's (1), Andrew's (2), Joseph's (3),
etc. Each is listed chronologically, according to
the year of birth. Granddaughters appear under
their maiden names, and in all instances the .
original Danish spelling of the surname Christen-
sen has been used, although a number may now
‘spell the name Christenson. It is too confusing
to do otherwise, —

How fortunate we are to be able to present
some of the experiences of these people as told by
themselves; for most of those living sent in their
own histories which ranged in length from very-
short to far-too-lengthy to be published in full here.
We are most grateful for each and everyone, how-
ever, and delighted to find that our Christensen
cousins have about run the gamut of interests and
accomplishments in this great panorama of modern
American living.

APPENDIX C

THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF
ENGLAND AND DENMARK

(Special permission to reprint this material
in our Christensen book was given ina letter from
Ib Permin of ANDR. FRED HOST AND SON of
Copenhagen, Denmark, publishers of A History of
The Kingdom of Denma rk, )

The sovereigns of. England can be traced back
considerably further than those of Denmark, but
then during the early centuries England was divided
into several kingdoms of varying sizes. Alfred the
Great was the first to stem the Danish onslaught,
and after him followed a number of Saxon kings.

In 975 came Edward the Martyr (slain by Danish
Vikings),.

_ Listed on the following pages, from this
Edward onwards, are the kings and queens of
England side by side with those of Denmark, This
may help English readers to get their bearings in
Danish history,
