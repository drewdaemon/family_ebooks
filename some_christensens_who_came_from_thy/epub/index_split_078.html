  <p class="calibre1">(32) Spencer Christensen (7). was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 31 Mar. 1908. His sister LaFaun writes: “Spencer died 6 May 1908 in Gunnison. I remember being with him at the time. He took convulsions. He was buried in the Gunnison Cemetery. I used to ride my horse to the cemetery nearly every day during nice weather to put flowers on his little grave. I remember his funeral, which was held in our Christensen grandparents’ big rock house which later became our home.”</p>
