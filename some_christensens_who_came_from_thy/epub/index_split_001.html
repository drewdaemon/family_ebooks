  <p class="calibre1">I desire to record my appreciation to a few of the numbers of people on whom I have depended for information and inspiration in the writing of this book, without whose assistance it might never have been accomplished. MANY THANKS… First of all to my patient husband, Daniel M., for time and quiet in which to write, and any and all else I desired of him; to my children and brothers and sisters for their confidence in me; to my many wonderful Christensen cousins who have so willingly helped; to a nephew, Bryce Christensen, for translations, etc.; to a native Dane, Gunnar Christensen, for advice on Denmark; to a friend, Evelyn Lord, for typing and forebearance; to certain individuals who have written about Denmark, particularly the Danish author Palle Lauring for his “A History of the Kingdom of Denmark”, as well as former Church Historian, Andrew Jensen, for his “History of the Scandinavian Mission”, from each of which I have gleaned much information and quoted freely; and last but not least, thanks to Ib Permin of Andr. Fred. Host &amp; Son of Copenhagen, Denmark for permission to use excerpts from the English translation of Mr. Lauring’s book, published by that company.</p>
