  <p class="calibre1">(67) Viola Emma Clark (9) the sixty-seventh and last grandchild of Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen has written a few details about her own life as follows:- “I was born 21 June 1931 in the hospital at Payson, Utah Co., Utah. My folks were living at Santaquin at the time. I was the youngest of eight children. Mother said I was ill quite a bit when I was small but since then my general health has been good.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I attended twelve years of formal schooling, first in Santaquin where I spent the first eighteen years of my life and then in Payson where I graduated from Payson High School in the spring of 1949. I also graduated from the LDS Seminary there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I met my future husband, Russell Widdison, the summer after graduation. Although he went into the army for three years soon after we met, I waited for him. Soon after his return we were married in Provo, Utah 23 May 1952. (Russell Boyd Widdison was born 4 Sep, 1930 in Heber City, Utah, the son of Joseph Royal and Ada Harrison Widdison). We lived here in Utah for two years following our marriage and then moved to Chicago, Illinois for two years where Russell studied electronics at the DeVry Technical College <span id="page-976"></span> Institute. Although he later went into mechanics, the two years study was certainly not wasted. It was here that our daughter Darryl was born. We moved back to Utah and our second daughter, Cheryl, was born in our home state.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We have lived in several cities in Utah during our married life, including Santaquin, Richfield, American Fork, Bountiful, and are presently buying a home in North Salt Lake. I have worked as a nurses aide in nursing homes and hospitals most of the years since I was married. I am presently employed at the South Davis Hospital in Bountiful as an L. P. N. I have brown hair, brown eyes, am 5 ft. 5½ inches tall and I hope I am easy going.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have taught Junior Sunday School for two years, Primary for two years and am at present a visiting teacher in the Relief Society. On 23 June 1961 Russell and I went to the temple in Salt Lake City for our endowments and sealings and had our two daughters sealed to us, so that our family can be together as a family in eternity. My life has been a happy one and I appreciate the great heritage given me by my good parents and other worthy progenitors and will be happy to learn more of them through our Christensen book. I never knew any of my grandparents since they all four died before I was born.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Few of the descendants of Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen have ever taken time to visit in Little Denmark and fewer still, except perhaps our family missionaries to Denmark, have visited North Jutland or Thy where our Danish progenitors came from over one hundred and three years ago. This summer, however, Lois Myrup Anderson, <span id="page-977"></span>Grandfather Christensen’s sister Maren Christensen Myrup’s granddaughter who has loved Denmark as I do, went to Jutland to visit the homeland of our people. She wrote to share her experiences there with me and I want to share them with you, the descendants of Laurs and Else K., in a hope that they may stimulate some of us to visit there someday also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following are excerpts from Lois’ stimulating letter:- “Virginia, I went to Denmark at last, on a chartered World Airlines plane, leaving June 10th and returning July 12th (1969). I met my Myrup cousins there and found them to be’very friendly, lovable people. I hada wonderful visit with all of them. Hans Peter Myrup took me to Myrupgard, once the home of my grandfather Lars Myrup. We hiked over the dunes to see the North Sea, while he told me as much as he knew of our common ancestors. We visited others of our Myrup relatives and then he took me to Thisted to the Missions Hotel where I stayed for six days on my own. I wanted to get as much Thisted atmosphere as I could and I felt 1 could do this best when I was alone. I fell in love with Thisted !</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When we crossed the Limfjord ‘goose pimples’ came out on me. This was Christensen and Myrup country! The water even looked familiar, like I’d seen it before! At Aalborg it looked like a wide river but at Thisted it seemed like my own special sea! Denmark wasn’t always as fertile and productive as it is now, but I’d like to think that it was much the same when our loved ones lived there. Pictures of Thisted (in the Museum) in the year 1849 show it as a very small village. Most of the houses were small compared to the beautiful red-tiled farm houses that now stand out so picturesquely against the green fields and the many nearby man-made forests. The Viking arrow heads, spear heads, stone axes in the Thisted Museum were not the remains of unknown Indians! These things were made by our own ancestors! These burial mounds undisturbed in green fields! Ancestors! We came from Viking country, Virginia! I saw the evidence all around in Thisted Amt (Thy), more than in any other part <span id="page-978"></span>of Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Later on I went on a bus down to see Gettrup. I was alone I thought, but now I don’t know, I met only one family in Gettrup and this in rather an odd way. The strange meeting in the churchyard convinced me that something or somebody intended for us to meet. I was just coming out of the Parish churchyard of a lovely old church with its surrounding ‘grave plots’, family plots which were like individual gardens complete with small hedges, blooming plants, small evergreens and rose bushes. I had walked among the tombstones and recorded names and dates of all Christensens, Kristensens and Lauritzens buried there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As I went to leave I met beautiful, dark-haired Mrs, Oxlund at the gate. She looked surprised to see me there. I smiled at her and said ‘Good morning, Do you speak English?’ She smiled, shook her head and said, ‘Nej’. I then asked, ‘Do you know anyone else who does?! She looked bewildered so I tried something else. ‘Do you know Christensens?’ I said. ‘Ja, Ja’, she said and motioned for me to get into her car, (The “Vest Vind’ was blowing hard that day). Then she turned and looked at me questioningly. That was when I decided to show her my picture of Myrupgard, though why I shall never know. ‘Myrupgard’ I said, ‘the home of some of my ancestors’, ‘Myrupgard’ - she stared at the picture and then at me - ‘Myrupgard!’ Suddenly she threw her flowers onto the back seat; (she had come to put them on her mother’s grave), started her car and took me to see her husband who asked to see the picture I brought. He spoke English rather well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“‘Who sent you to us?’ he asked in bewilderment; ‘I know this place, Myrupgard; my family and I have been there many times. It is owned by my brother-in-law, Did he tell you to come to us?’ ‘No, no’ I said emphatically, Staring at him. ‘I just came to see Gettrup because my grandmother was born near here. Mr. Oxlund, is there anyone else in Gettrup who would have known about Myrupgard?’ ‘Nej, Nej’ he said, as excited as I.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">‘I am the only one.‘</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-979"></span>“‘I met your brother-in-law’ I said, ‘but he honestly didn’t know I was coming down here. I just can’t believe this happened as it did. In five minutes I would have left the churchyard when I met your wife at the gate - just like someone wanted us to meet!’ I wonder now, Virginia, if the Oxlunds felt the spiritual implications of our mutual experience as much as I did. They felt something - I saw it in their faces as we stared at each other. They would not let me go. I spent the rest of the day until my bus was to leave (at 3:30 p.m.) with them. Mr. Oxlund took me to see the only remaining Christensen in Gettrup, but she was not a relative. He also contacted the oldest man in Gettrup who remembered a Christensen farm there but the family had all moved away. They took me to see the Parish Priest but he seemed rather reluctant to look up records when I wouldn’t even give him a date as to when and where the last Christensens left Gettrup. Both Mr. and Mrs. Oxlund looked a little perturbed when I told them I was a Mormon and lived in Salt Lake City; but they were lovely people and very soon we were talking like old friends.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Virginia, Gettrup had many beautiful farms but the town itself was very small. There was a store, a cafe, a drive-in with its familiar ‘Is Ees’, meaning ice cream, milk nickles, cones, etc. There is also the lovely old church I mentioned. Actually though it is a beautiful place! I think Maren must have wept many times remembering the green, rolling fields, the Viking mounds, the Limfjord, the ‘West Sea’ and the low hanging clouds drifting in from the ocean. But perhaps it is greener now than it was in those days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was a wonderful day! Danish homes are unbelievable clean and beautiful and Mrs. Oxlund’s was particularly lovely! There were draperies patterned in Danish blues and sill length curtains of Danish net bordered in a lacy design. Every piece of furniture, every painting, rug, clock, etc., seemed to have been chosen because it fit perfectly into the place or space where it stood or hung. ‘You love blue’, I said to her, looking around; for even the china on her dining room table<span id="page-980"></span> had a ‘blue’ picture of sea gulls flying.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Denmark and sea gulls - how they do go together! These are smaller gulls than ours, some with black heads and dark grey wings. Every time I looked up I saw gulls flying - and at Myrupgard the larks winging overhead, singing their constant cheery little song high above the grassy dunes as cousin Hans Peter Myrup and I looked out towards the sea. These are pictures I shall cherish always!”</p>
