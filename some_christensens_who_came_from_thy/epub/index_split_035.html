    <p class="calibre1">Lord, behold our family here assembled; we thank thee for this place in which we dwell; for the love that unites us; for the peace accorded us this day; for the hope with which we expect the morrow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else K. Christensen were parents of elevent children, including two pairs of twines. One twin of each pari died soon after birth so are not counted as branches on their family tree but only as twigs. The remaining six boys and three girls in this part of the book as the Nine Branches of their Family Tree and the stories of their lives appear in the order of their births. With few exceptions these histories were written mainly by various of their children, at the request of this author. Brief accounts of each of their marriage partners are also included. Two foster daughters, partially raised by Laurs and Else, have something about them recorded here as well. None of these life histories are intended to be sophisticated biographies, for although they contain important and interesting data they are more like heartfelt, colorful, tender and even sometimes sad recollections about these whose graves we now tend and whose memories we so fondly cherish.</p>
