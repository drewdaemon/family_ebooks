  <p class="calibre1"><span></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur (twin) ninth child but eighth producing branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen family, was born about four o’clock a.m. 19 July 1882 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. He was named and blessed that same day by his paternal grandfather, Christen Christensen. His twin sister born shortly after him that same morning was blessed and named Martina Lauriette right away but died about noon the day of her birth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is doubtful that the new rock house on the Christensen lot in northwest Gunnison had been completed by the time of the twins’ birth so they must have been born in the old two-roomed adobe house that stood well back on that lot at 180 West lst North, which dwelling has long since been demolished. However, the Christensen family, then numbering ten, must have moved into their new rock house built west and south and near the old one, while Arthur was very young, at least to live in the winter months. This “new rock house”, though now very old, is still standing and owned and occupied at present (1969) by Ella Knighton Hansen. <span id="page-627"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur’s first several summers were spent with his parents and brothers and sisters in Christenburg where his father had leased a farm. The boy was often left in the charge of his older brothers and sisters, since his mother was a doctor and midwife and her services were much sought after in Gunnison Valley.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When of proper age he entered the public schools at Gunnison, which convened within a few blocks of his home. Soon after he turned eight years old, Sat. 6 Aug. 1890, he was baptized in the Sanpitch River some distance from his home by Brother C. J. Swenson. Brother R. G. Fraser confirmed him next day, Sun. 7 Aug. 1890, in church.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur’s youth was spent attending school in winters and working at home and on land farmed by his father in summers. There was plenty for all to do on their place with chickens, ducks, cows, horses, lambs and pigs to feed and care for, as well as a large garden and a lucerne patch. His parents were not ones who liked to see their | children idle. Arthur was often found in the companionship of his brother Louis, some two years older and much larger. When they were old enough their oldest brother, Chris “I”, gave the two work with his herds and thus they learned early of the sheep herding business. This was a great family to work together and help each other out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur was of a gentle, kind and patient nature, like his father. He had a happy disposition and was easy to get along with. That his older, fun-loving brother Louis sometimes took advantage of this to involve him in “pranks” can well be imagined. (A few of these have been related earlier in the book.) That their youngest sister, Elvena, often became a victim of their mischief we can be sure. But Arthur grew to manhood a hard worker, dependable and loving life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur’s parents, but more particularly his mother, had a great desire that their children become well educated. Most of his older brothers and sisters had gone on to school following their <span id="page-628"></span> eighth grade education and several had graduated from the B. Y. A. in Provo. Whatever his reasons, Louis refused to go on to school and this undoubtedly had some effect on Arthur. However, his parents finally persuaded him to get some higher education and he attended the B. Y. A. the winter of 1901/1902. He roomed that year at 333 East 5th North in Provo, which was the David Jones home, no longer standing. Whether he attended college more than that one winter we cannot be certain, although it is quite possible that he may have attended B. Y. A. the following winter also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur was “keeping company” at the time with a girl, Millie Gledhill, a pretty dark-eyed, dark-haired young lady of many talents who lived two blocks west of his home in Gunnison. Though she was not attending school at Provo they corresponded regularly. Her brother Bert gives this account of how the two became interested in each other: — “During those days in Gunnison Grandpa and Grandma Christensen (I always called them this) kept a boarding house and my older sister Millie went to work for Grandma, helping with the housework and cooking. Of course this brought Arthur Marinus Christensen and Amelia Jane ‘Millie’ Gledhill together in courtship - and later marriage.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie’s sister, Mary Gledhill Dowdle, now in her eighties, tells of their marriage: - “When Arthur and Millie were married they went to the Manti Temple, 3 Feb. 1904. She turned twenty-two twenty-three days later. She was five months older than he, lacking one week. A large wedding reception was held that night at our home and, as was the custom, a big dinner was served to all the guests.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The two first lived in a small house two doors east of his parents, Grandpa and Grandma Christensen as we called them, but when mother died about a year later (1905) they moved two and a half blocks west into our home so that Millie could care for father and us younger Gledhill children. It was here, 22 June 1905, that their first child Arthur Melrose was born. He was a beautiful baby and they nicknamed him ‘Rosy’.”</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-629"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie’s brother Bert continues with his story: — “After leaving the Gledhill home where Melrose was born, on 367 West lst North in Gunni- son, which is still standing, Arthur and Millie moved to a home on Second South and Second West, which I believe they rented and which has long since been torn down. Here their next three children were born, which included another son, Wesley, and a pair of twin girls, Grace and Gladys.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After his marriage Arthur was associated with his brother A. H. Christensen in the sheep business. They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt. east of Salina. After lambing, about July lst, they would move into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months and then winter on the west desert. As I remember, Arthur and his brother Lou took care of the sheep on the desert until the later years. I also helped Arthur with the sheep at times. The summer of 1910 we got word to take 1500 head of sheep and start for the Weber River area above Oakley, Utah. Arthur met us above Gunnison and was in charge from there on. That, I believe, was the start of the Bennion Livestock Company in which Arthur, A. H. and Chris ‘I’ Christensen became interested. Chris ‘I’ was made general manager of the company.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the summer of 1910 also, Chris ‘I’ sold out his interests in Gunnison and moved his family to Salt Lake City, but spent most of his time on ‘The Weber’ where the Bennion Livestock Company owned a large ranch and had their main headquarters. Arthur bought Chris’ home at this time and moved his family there to 3rd West 1st South.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This home is standing today. In 1911 the Bennion Livestock Company bought a small ranch at Upton, Utah, in Summit County on Huff Creek from a Mr. Benson and Arthur was appointed foreman of that ranch. He moved his family to Upton the spring of 1911. I lived with Arthur and Millie and worked on the ranch for some time. Though not a rendezvous for the Bennion Livestock Company’s herders, they came there for supplies which were hauled twelve miles by team from Coalville.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie was then expecting her fifth baby and as winter came on and the year began to draw to a <span id="page-630"></span> close her hour of delivery grew nearer. They rented a small place in Coalville, where she could be near a doctor and medical help. She and the four children moved there for about a month and Arthur was by her side as much as he could be. The child, a little girl, came 18 Jan. 1912. Arthur dropped a card to his father-in-law, Nephi Gledhill of Gunnison, Utah, that same day, announcing her birth: - “Dear Father” it read, “a girl - at Coalville - 9 lbs. Our girl came a little sooner than expected - but all seems to be well, Arthur.” They gave her a blessing and a name, Mildred, right away, but little Mildred died the following day, 19 Jan, 1912, of prematurity. She was buried in Coalville.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both Grace and Gladys have vivid recollections of those days. Gladys writes: — “Grace and I used to play in the storehouse at Upton, which was sometimes used for the storage of dynamite. One of our favorite games was playing ‘Papa and Mama’. One day Grace was the papa, whose job it was to get up in the morning to make the fire. We had some matches and she set fire to an old rope which was hanging from the ceiling. About that time mother called us and we scampered out, not realizing that in a matter of minutes the whole . place might be ablaze. Our Uncle Bert Gledhill spotted the smoke and got everyone out of the house in a hurry, as they thought there was dynamite in the storehouse. But there wasn’t. Grace and I didn’t tell ‘til years later that we had started the fire, and then no one believed us.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grace writes: — “When our family moved to Upton Gladys seemed to be the constant concern of everyone there. Besides falling into the ditch and almost drowning, had not Uncle Bert saved her, she fell down the elevator shaft at Coalville, to say nothing of setting the storehouse on fire at our home in Upton, I was in on this too, and I can remember being thrown over the fence in an awful hurry - and words about ‘gun powder being stored there’,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Both Melrose and Wesley started school at Upton, They rode horses - we all did, the four of us kids on one horse at times. Melrose was <span id="page-631"></span> reliable and was the ‘boss’ when Dad and Mother were away. I remember the flash flood and water running through the house in all directions and the four of us standing on the table with fire shovels, trying to shovel it out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember the wonderful music made by my father and mother. Their sweet voices blended so beautifully. Mother played the guitar and dad the mandolin. At this time I thought there was nothing so heavenly. Many times we were lulled to sleep by their songs.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both Arthur and Millie had good voices and loved music. Arthur had sung in the Gunnison ward choir in his younger days, along with his older brother Louis. Millie had done some public entertaining, along with her younger sisters, Mary and Sylvia, when she was a girl at home. Arthur and Millie were fine companions. Both were young at heart and both really loved life. They had such good times together - and how they loved to dance! Whenever possible they attended the local dances at Upton regularly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dances were held in the Upton amusement hall on weekends. On special occasions children’s dances were held in the afternoons and then the adults would take over and dance until dawn, usually to music on the organ and the violin. This was not an ordinary amusement hall but a very unique one. It was built by the small community in 1891 and was 50 feet long 26 feet wide and 13 feet high, with wainscoating up from the bottom 4 feet. The unusual thing about it was the upper walls, for on these a local artist, Frank Clark who had joined the LDS church in England and come to Zion in 1863, finally settling in Upton, had painted some outstanding murals. One side was the scene of an Indian village, the other a landscape scene complete with animals. The battleship Maine covered one end of the hall and a steam engine pulling many cars covered the other. It was quite a sight and visitors came from all over the west to see this magnificent hall and to dance in it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur and Millie themselves usually had visitors in summers, for they were excellent <span id="page-632"></span> company and had many friends. Also, their relatives often came. Arthur’s father, Laurs, spent at least one summer helping on the ranch there. Arthur’s sister Elvena also came to stay with them for a time and help Millie out. Few visited in winters however, for these were very cold and Upton folks were often snowed in. But the dances went on there just the same.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fall of 1915, when the twins were ready to enter school for the first time, Arthur moved the family back to Gunnison into their home they had bought from his brother Chris “I”. Grace writes: — “We moved back to Gunnison and mother really had her hands full trying to get Gladys and me ready for our first day at school. All our things were handmade, even our bloomers and hand knit stockings. How we longed for something ‘store bought’. I recall so well the old rain barrel that stood by our house. The soft rain water it held was used for washing our long hair. One day, as we children were all lined up for inspection, Wesley backed into it. Gladys and I shrieked with delight at the big splash - but we were silenced by a whop! ‘You just simply have no regard for the efforts of your mother’ said our dad.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Later that fall Arthur bought the lovely red brick house of his sister Elsie Bartholomew. She was estranged from her husband at the time and desired to move into less expensive quarters. He traded the home they were living in in southwest Gunnison in on the deal and Elsie and her children moved into that old home, which had been built by their brother Chris, and Arthur and his family moved into the nice new home in the northeast part of town. This was in the latter part of 1915, but whether the move took place before the birth of Arthur’s and Millie’s sixth child, David, 16 Nov. 1915, is not known for sure, although Millie’s sister Mary G. Dowdle says that David was probably born in the new red brick home. Grace writes:— “Our family moved into a handsome red brick house. This was wonderful - pavement all over, up to the barn, around the house, down to the street - everywhere it seemed. We children raced around in our little wagons.” <span id="page-633"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur leased a farm of some 327 acres from Gussie Villard northwest a few miles from Gunnison. His brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill, worked for him here. Gladys writes: — “After we moved into the beautiful red brick house in northwest Gunnison, I guess we didn’t have much money, as mother took in boarders. Then one summer soon after, we almost cried when we found out our dad and mother had rented our beautiful house to some ‘foreigners’ and we were going to move to the farm northwest of Gunnison.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur moved his family back into the red brick house the fall before their seventh child, Max, was born, 17 Oct. 1920. Grace writes: — “Gladys and I were going on twelve when Max was born. He was the only one of us children that was born in a hospital. Mother went to Salina and I remember the concern that she might not make it. It was shortly after this that Father and Mother decided to go into the grocery business and politics. Dad was persuaded by friends to run for Mayor of Gunnison. He lost the race by about two votes. Actually, he was relieved to have lost for his heart wasn’t in it - nor the grocery store either. He longed to be back outside with the animals and the soil - so took up farming again.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By the fall of 1924 both Melrose and Wesley had gotten tired of no prospects in Gunnison except farming and struck out on their own. They soon found work in the mines in Juab County. Arthur and Millie had the opportunity to buy a hotel in Manti and Millie decided she wanted to try her hand at it and so they sold their lovely home in Gunnison and at Christmas time that year took over the Eagle House hotel in Manti. Millie was a hard worker, a great manager and a wonderful cook. The twins, now in their Sophomore year in high school, were a lot of help to her and soon things were running smoothly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur left the running of the hotel to the women. There seemed little need for him there much of the time. He was an ambitious fellow and a hard worker, growing restless when forced to be idle too long. He finally went to the mine where his two oldest sons were employed. Leola <span id="page-634"></span> Burraston, who later became his daughter-in-law, wrote of this:— “It was in 1927, I believe, when Arthur first came to the mine. I was assistant postmistress at the Tintic Standard Mining Co. in Dividend. He worked in the mine for a few months, You know he was never idle. Millie had the hotel at Manti at that time. He used to talk to me a good deal at that time. He was so much like his son Wesley in manner - very quiet but so thoughtful and kind.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1928 Arthur bought a ranch (in Flat Canyon) and asked Wes if he would like to quit at the mine and help him at this time. Wes didn’t really want to leave Dividend but he loved his father dearly and desired to be with him. He was underground and young and could see the benefits of getting out into the open air and under God’s sky - but mostly it was to be with his father that swung the decision. Arthur wasn’t really feeling too well at this time but still he had come to the mine and then the two of them left for Flat Canyon early in the spring of 1928.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“A few months after they left Arthur became very ill. He was a hemophiliac and even if he had a tooth pulled he feared a hemorrhage. He suffered from frequent nosebleeds and at that time he had a particularly severe one. Wes rushed him to the hospital in Salt Lake City, I believe.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur recovered and was able to go back to work. Later, Wesley returned to the mine in Dividend. It was about that time that Arthur received an opening with the Howell Livestock Company. This was the company that had bought out the Bennion Livestock Company sometime after the death of his brother Chris “I”, (about 1918). Arthur went to work for this new company as foreman of their Trout Creek ranch, which was in southern Utah out some distance from Delta and close to the Nevada border. Here they produced upwards of 4,000 turkeys yearly, which were shipped to California and sold as “Howell’s Holiday Turkeys.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though Trout Creek was quite a distance from Manti, Arthur’ came home on occasions and <span id="page-635"></span> Grace writes of one of these: — “We were all together for our parents’ Silver Wedding anniversary, Feb. 3, 1929. The hotel was full of friends from all over. Melrose pulled a real surprise. He and Reva Giles, who had been married two days before, unknown to any of us, chose this time and place to make their announcement. The hat was passed and they started off on their honeymoon. Wesley and Leola Burraston were married a few months later. Both boys met their wives in Dividend.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grace continues: — “I often looked at my mother and thought of the wonderful job she was doing as manager of the hotel there in Manti. Many times I marveled at her - truly a beautiful woman, with warm brown eyes and classic features. My father too was a handsome, honest and kind man. He was the smallest of the Christensen brothers, being of about average height but taller than mother. I feel sad at times to think that they were separated so much in their later years of marriage.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur was still working at Trout Creek in November of 1931, as a letter written 5 Nov. 1931 by Max, then eleven, indicates, among other things. It was written to Gladys who was then working in Salt Lake and read as follows: — “Dear Gladys, how are you? Iam fine and so is the rest of the family. We had a surprise today - Dad came home. He is alright although he said he had a little pain in his neck… Mother has dozed off to sleep in her chair; Daddy is taking a bath; Jack Burns is sitting listening to the radio. I don’t know where Dave is right now but I guess he will be home soon. He and I have been playing with paper airplanes tonight and having a lot of fun. Dave is going back out with Dad to help pick feathers off the turkeys for a couple of weeks. I wish I could go too. Daddy says next time he comes home he will bring us a lot of pinenuts. He says he likes the new boy out there and that he sure is a good worker. Jack Burns is still playing the radio. It seems it is about nine o’clock and soon time for Amos and Andy…” This letter was written on stationery bearing the heading: “Eagle Hotel - Mrs. A. M. <span id="page-636"></span> Christenson, Prop. Home Like - Reasonable.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was while ranching at Trout Creek, however, that Arthur’s health began to fail desperately and he was forced to return home. They were shocked to see how pale and thin he had become. A letter from Max to Gladys, 13 Oct, 1932, and a postscript from Millie, follows: “Dear Gladys: How are you all up there? We are all fine except Daddy. He is pretty sick tonight. I received your present the day before my birthday and thanks very much. Grace gave me a pair of cords. Mama gave me shorts and shirts and sox and let me have a party. When I got my money all together it made $2.00. We invited fifteen boys with myself and served punch and cookies and had a melon bust. Just when we got the melon we saw some smoke and the siren started to sound and boy, did we go! Some man said of us - ‘There goes the fire squad’. It was an old woodshed up by Mrs. Wilson’s. Dave has a swell new typewriter. It is soon halloween. Mother is calling supper - so goodbye - Max.” The P.S, by Millie read: — “Gladys, there isn’t anything much to tell you and I am pretty busy. Have a few railroad men and others here and Papa needs waiting on. He is going to the hospital next week, as soon as it is opened, and stay until he is better. It is sure hard on all of us. Dave is going deer hunting next week - love, Mother.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A letter from Millie to Gladys, Oct. 15, 1932, follows:— “Dear Gladys, I got your letter yesterday just as we were leaving for Salina. I took Papa to the hospital; he didn’t feel as if he could make the trip to Salt Lake. I’m almost afraid we’ve waited too long and the future doesn’t look too good. I called Dr. Hagan Monday and he said to take him to the Doctors Merrill. They gave him a thorough examination and he was in no condition to have an X-ray so he is taking medicine and trying to get built up to have it next Monday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“They found his blood pressure thirty degrees too low and not enough red corpusles. They told me on the side that he is in very bad shape and if he ever gets well it will take months. They don’t think it’s his stomach at all but in the blood. They have sent some blood to Salt Lake to be tested for <span id="page-637"></span> diabetes. They could find no sugar in the urine but think it may be in the blood and this test has to be done in Salt Lake. He is in no pain much now but so tired and weak. He sleeps all too much and no matter what he eats or how much he is still hungry. He looks bad and the last few days pale. They may take him to Salt Lake, I don’t know. The hospital in Salina has closed but the doctors have their offices there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I am all unstrung - haven’t slept much for three nights and am trying to get fruit put up. I was gone all day yesterday. Grandma (Sorena) stayed here. There is not much business right now. Dave and Max are studying. I wish you would come home more often. Grace was up to institute today but I guess she didn’t have time to run down and see us. I had a letter from the boys (at Dividend); they all had bad colds over there. Can’t write anymore tonight - Mother.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another letter from Millie to Gladys afew : days later, Tues. 19 Oct. 1932, gave the following: — “Dear Gladys, your last letter found me up to my neck in peaches and plum jam. Hope I’ll be through with fruit this week. Dave took Papa to Salina yesterday. They worked on him all day and didn’t finish. He has to go back Sunday. Seems that they just can’t find his trouble but know that there is something wrong. They tested him again for diabetes but found no trace of sugar. They should have returns on the blood tests they sent to Salt Lake, Sunday also. Now they think there is an obstruction just at the place his stomach empties. My, but it’s a worry. He feels a little better today and is starving but must have nothing but liquids. He is almost too weak to walk.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grace called last night. She said she couldn’t study or do anything for thinking of him. I will let you know if he gets worse. He is taking medicine and Dr. Merrill seems to think it isn’t as serious as at first - but we will know more after Sunday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Max is getting fat again and eats like a little pig. He and Dave are studying; Papa is asleep; I am baking bread and finishing my ironing. We have <span id="page-638"></span> sent for a new typewriter for Dave and he is a happy boy about that. I wish you would go to see Elaine and Pearl too. Answer soon - love, Mother.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur got no better and was rushed to the Salina hospital. A card written by him from Salina to Gladys in Salt Lake, Fri. 22 Oct. 1932, bore this message: - “Dearest Gladys: Your letter and parcel came this morning. Thanks a lot dear. I surely appreciate it. The doctors says I am better! I surely have a lot of distress. After I eat it seems worse than before but I guess it just has to be. I get along pretty good in the day but the nights are bad. I cannot sleep very long at a time and lay awake so much but am trying to get better. Haven’t heard from mother since you were here - guess she is awfully busy. Hope I can get away from here before too long. Best love, Dad.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some two weeks later Arthur was taken from the hospital in Salina to the L.D.S. hospital in Salt Lake City to undergo an abdominal operation. He was in serious condition. A letter from twelve year old Max, written to him at Manti Nov. 30, 1932 and sent by way of Gladys in Salt Lake, was as follows: “Dear Daddy: - How do you feel by now? We sure all feel sorry for you and are hoping that you will soon get well and come home. It sure seems lonesome around here and we all felt so bad when they phoned and said you had to have a second operation. I have the flu but I am lots better now. Mama has a little cold tonight but I guess she will get alright. She is now cooking supper. I am still doing my beading work and I sure have made a lot of bracelets and rings. It sure is fascinating. It sure is warm down here now but it is cold sometimes. We have the furnace going now. The bottom part of it burned out but Dave fixed it tonight with some pieces of iron.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dave has got one load of fat pinewood since you left and maybe we will get another Saturday. We went out last Saturday and got a load of barley. We haven’t killed our pig yet because mother said she couldn’t take care of it now. I am still busy in my Scout work and doing fine. I sure wish I could get up there to see you but I guess I can’t <span id="page-639"></span> until you are ready to come home, which I hope is soo. I am doing fine in school and I guess Dave is too. We are all sure wishing you were well and wondering how you feel tonight, but I guess it won’t do us any good to wonder. Loads of love - Max. (And hurry and get well!)”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur passed away 4 Dec. 1932 in Salt Lake City at age fifty years four months and fifteen days. A ruptured gall bladder was said to have contributed to his death. He was brought to Manti for burial which took place Sunday 7 Dec. 1932 in the Manti Cemetery. He was laid on a plot belonging to his brother Albert and sold to the family, not far from the last resting place of his father and mother, Laurs and Else K. Christensen. The burial was preceeded by an impressive funeral service, an account of which was carried by the Manti Messenger the following day, Dec. 8, 1932, under this heading: - “Death Comes to Relieve Sufferer”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“True testimony of respect and love was strongly pronounced Sunday afternoon for Arthur M. Christensen when final rites were held at the North Ward chapel where a host of friends and associates had gathered to pay last respects. Merciful death claimed the life of Arthur Thursday evening at a Salt Lake hospital. The passing relieved him of untold agony and suffering.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">‘Three weeks ago Arthur was taken to the hospital for an abdominal operation. For a few days his life hung by a thread but he was given several blood transfusions and he seemed to be on the road to recovery. Suddenly he became worse and a second operation was necessary, which was performed Wednesday, but only added to his suffering. His wife and daughter Gladys and son David were by his bedside at his passing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Bishop E. T. Reed was in charge of the services which were as follows: Opening song by the choir - ‘Abide With Me’. Invocation was offered by Elder Byron Peterson of Gunnison. Other musical numbers were solos ‘No Night There’ by Mrs. Sylvia Metcalf of Gunnison, ‘Resignation’ by Mrs. Elaine Southwick of Salt Lake City, and ‘Lay My Head Beneath the Rose’ <span id="page-640"></span> by Sam Parry. Jose. A. Larson of Hamilton Ward (Gunnison), Sherman Christensen of Provo, Ray P. Lund of Manti, Mrs. D. Dally of Salt Lake City, and Mrs. John Riddle of Manti were the speakers. All touched on the friendly, cheerful and honest disposition of the deceased. Benediction was pronounced by Clyde Whitlock of Mayfield.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Amelia Jane Gledhill (Christensen ) wife of Arthur Marinus Christensen, was born 26 Feb, 1882 at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the daughter of Nephi and Sarah Jane Caldwell Gledhill, of English descent. Later her family moved to Gunnison, Utah and there is where “Millie”, as she was called, grew to womanhood, attending the schools afforded by that community.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She belonged to a large family where girls were in the majority and several of them very talented in singing and entertaining. Two of her younger sisters, Mary and Sylvia, sang together a lot and were very good for that time. They sang “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” and “Whispering Hope” for the first time in that part of the country.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie herself was talented not only in music but in many other ways.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She was a very pretty girl with lovely hair and soft brown eyes, almost classic features and of rather small stature. She was very popular as a girl and young woman and had many friends and admirers, One of these early friends wrote to her, many many years later, the following: — “Millie, dearest friend of my girlhood, how I did idolize you! You were so beautiful and did every- thing so well, I recall so well the laughing sparkle of your eyes and the way your hair looked. How I did wish I could be like you… . It is impossible to express the gratitude I feel for friends like you. God love you and keep you - lovingly, Eva,”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was necessary for the Gledhill girls, as well as the boys, to work when and where they could out of the home. Mostly it was housework for the girls unless one was fortunate enough to get a position as salesgirl with a mercantile <span id="page-641"></span> establishment or take up school teaching. When the new Gunnison Telephone Company was incorporated in 1909, in which Leo Gledhill took an important part, Mary Gledhill operated the mag- netic switchboard on the second floor of the post- office building. Several years before, Mary worked for Albert and Jennie Christensen in Manti when their oldest son, Sherman, was born.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie went to work for Laurs and Else K. Christensen, whom everyone called Grandpa and Grandma, two and a half blocks east of the Gledhill home. They were operating a boarding house at the time and employed two girls, Millie helped with the housework and the cooking and doubtless learned a great deal about Danish cooking from Else K. It was at this time that she became very interested in the youngest Christensen son, Arthur, a handsome blond young man with blue eyes. A romance soon developed between the two and continued for several years, during part of which time Arthur attended the B. Y. A. in Provo.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie and Arthur were married in the beautiful Manti Temple on Wednesday 3 Feb, 1904. Millie was nearly twenty-two and Arthur was some five months younger. A history of the first few years of their married life has been given briefly in Arthur’s life story, but the birth of their twin girls is given more in detail by the oldest of the twins, Grace, and by Millie’s sister Mary Gledhill (Dowdle). Mrs. Dowdle writes: - “When the twins, Grace and Gladys, were born, Grace, a large, blond Christensen baby, came first, not long before midnight on 16 Feb. 1909. Two hours later, 17 Feb. 1909, Gladys, atiny, sickly, dark complexioned baby came. Millie, in her hysteria, refused to own the second twin so the doctor put her in my charge. I cared for this baby in my room at home for two weeks and fed her with an eye-dropper a combination of whiskey and some- thing else which Dr. Hagan mixed up, Later Millie was able to nurse both her babies and one other baby who wasn’t getting enough milk, Joseph’s and Roxie’s Virgil.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grace writes: - “My parents were proud and happy with their enlarged family, four children <span id="page-642"></span> under the age of four. Then too, the way things happened was quite the talk of the town - twins born on different days. We were quite a drain on mother’s health, so I’ve been told, so it was decided that Dad’s sister, Aunt Vena, would take care of me and mother’s sister, Aunt Mary, would take Gladys until mother should regain her strength.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As I remember, or have been told, the rock house in southwest Gunnison where we were born was a square structure with an upstairs and balcony. The water we used was taken from a well close to the back door and for light we used kerosine lamps. In fact, Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me. I heard the grownups talk and joke so much about this that I actually thought I had seen it. ‘Well’, I told the folks when they questioned my remembering, ‘I was there and heard the bang.’”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the twins were going on two the family moved to a ranch in Upton, Utah. The four years spent there were mostly pleasant ones in spite of the death of a day old baby girl, Mildred, their fifth child, 18 Jan. 1912 at Coalville, where Millie had gone to be near a doctor. The small community of Upton with its some forty families, mostly LDS, was a sociable town and many good times were had there. Millie and Arthur especially enjoyed the dances, Millie had her own saddlehorse and drove the two-seated buggy in which she and the children could come and go at will, even when the menfolk were busy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moving back to Gunnison the fall of 1915, in time to put the twins into school, Millie later had the thrill of moving into the large and beautiful “red-brick house! in time for the birth of her sixth child and third son, David, 16 Nov. 1915. Arthur was away much of the time on Bennion Livestock Company business and when she was able, Millie took in boarders, school teachers mostly,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She always kept her children looking nice, The twins she dressed alike and kept their hair in ringlets most of the time. They looked like little dolls, Grace with her blond curls and blue eyes and Gladys with her dark hair and dark eyes, She <span id="page-643"></span> didn’t neglect the girls’ musical education either, for she was determined that they would learn both to play the piano and sing. I remember so well going to the red brick house one time to visit, when the twins were about eight. Millie, as proud as she could be, had them stand up and sing to- gether, with appropriate actions, the song “I don’t Want to Play in Your Yard.” I can still see them in my mind’s eye and hear their sweet, childish voices, as if it were yesterday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was at Millie’s and Arthur’s red brick house that the Laurs and Else K. Christensen family gathered to have a family photograph taken, about the time they brought the oldest son, Chris “T” from Wyoming for his burial in Gunnison, 12 Oct. 1917. It was in this home that they met later in an inspiring family meeting, vowing to meet from then on in yearly family reunions and to keep closer together as a family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Millie and Arthur leased a farm northwest of Gunnison and decided to move there, they rented the red brick house. The children were able to do a lot on the farm in summers and Millie’s younger brother, Bert, came to work for them also. Millie made delicious butter and sold it to the stores in Gunnison in wrappers with her own name printed on them. This was always in demand. In her own history, the daughter Gladys comments on life on the farm: - “There was a two-roomed house on the farm and it was really surprising how warm and comfortable mother made it look, although it was rather crowded for our family of seven, Mother wanted to be sure that Grace and my muSical educations were not neglected, so down to the farm went our piano, and every week there were music lessons in town with plenty of: practicing in between.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie once told of how sad she was when their two older boys, Melrose and Wesley, left _ home to look for work, She watched them walking up the road carrying their suitcases, trying to “thumb” their way north, as long as her eyes could follow them - and then broke down and wept. It is not a happy experience for a mother when her first “chicks” leave the home and Millie was no <span id="page-644"></span> exception. In fact she was a very doting mother, withall.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The move to Manti at Christmastime of 1924 and the taking over of the Eagle House hotel there was a very challenging experience for Millie, but she was equal to it in every way. She was a fine cook, a good housekeeper, an excellent manager, and people liked her. Besides, she seemed to be an indefatigable worker and her health was good. The fact that those years ahead, which then looked so promising, should be saddened by the long illness and untimely death of her dear husband, was a sorrow to her indeed and left her very lonely. Two letters written by her soon after his death, 4 Dec. 1932, one to her son Melrose, whom she called “Rosy”, and his family and one to her daughter Gladys, who had both been home to their father’s funeral but returned to their homes in Salt Lake City, show in a measure her sorrow but mostly her courage: -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Wed. 10 Dec. 1932, Dear Ones: Received your card this A.M. Rosy, glad everything was fine when you arrived home. I forgot about Melvin’s birthday (Dec. 5th) just when you left and felt sorry about that. Iam sending him a small package today. The boys and I went to Gunnison late Sunday afternoon right after you left. It seemed so lonesome and awful here. We spent the evening at Leo’s (her brother) and left Grace for work next morning. When we returned the house seemed so empty and cold we three slept together. I’m so thankful for Dave and Max. Last night Max said to Dave, ‘We can’t both go to Mutual, we’ve got to take turns staying with mother.’ So Dave stayed. Before the night was over seven people came in and I have just given them breakfast. The lamb-buyers came back. I have a hired girl to help me house clean and catch up with so many neglected jobs. She is ironing. We washed yesterday and had the pig killed. I’ll send you some when I get at it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I may go to Salt Lake this weekend, There are bills and so much to tend to and we can do our Christmas shopping. Grace wants to go. I had to go to the bank this morning and borrow some money <span id="page-645"></span> until the insurance check comes. I don’t know how long that will take. I had spent about my last $1.00, Everything will be alright and I’m glad I have work and can keep on ‘keeping on’. So many people have called to see me and I have a stack of letters and cards, some from old friends I’d almost forgotten. Our old crowd from Gunnison are coming up to- night - about 20. It’s grand to have friends and you don’t know how proud I am of you all, Folks never get through telling me how wonderful my children are - and you are wonderful and that’s what keeps me up and trying to be brave. Write often to your lonely mother.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems Millie and Grace did go to Salt Lake that weekend, Grace was teaching school in Gunnison at the time. On their return, Millie made a. report to Gladys: - “Monday nite, 15 Dec. 1932. Dear Gladys - This has been the coldest day I have ever seen and tonight it is 20° below zero. Grace and Theron had a terrible time this morning before they got to Gunnison. I told them to take the Buick (they couldn’t start the Ford) but all of us together couldn’t start the Buick either. Theron got a car from the Motor Company to push it but that didn’t help. They pushed it way down by the fairgrounds but it was all froze up. Theron finally started his car, then towed the Buick into the garage. I’ll leave it there to have it overhauled and fixed for Christmas, About 10:30 a.m. Metcalf (Principal of the Gunnison school where Grace taught), phoned and said they had to dismiss school because they couldn’t get the schoolhouse warm and everything was frozen up. Theron and Grace got there in plenty of time for the afternoon, however.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We arrived home from Salt Lake about three yesterday. Everything was ok but thank goodness we didn’t stay another night or everything would have been frozen up. My flowers were alright. We found Max sick at Uncle Albert’s (in Provo). He had been sick all the time we were gone but they had been so good to him and kept him in. He is feeling better tonight but still has the earache. I didn’t wash today but have been cleaning upstairs - had Fanny in to help me. A letter was here from Uncle Bert saying he would be here right after the <span id="page-646"></span> 15th. (He came from Nevada and helped Millie dispose of the Flat Canyon ranch.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We stopped at Aunt Mary’s (in Payson) and had chili, She had an awful cold. Iwill send you a check for Grace. Be sure her coat is sent insured and right. There has been no bill from the hospital yet. Guess I’ll go crawl in bed with the boys to get warm. It’s lonesome tonight. Love - mother. P.S. I received a nice long letter from Aunt Sarah today, also from Edith, Elaine, Sherman, Bell and Neil. And all of my Gunnison friends have written or called.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grace was married less than a month after her father’s death. The Manti Messenger carried the announcement: - “Mrs. A, M. Christensen announces the marriage of her daughter Grace to Mr. Douglas Larsen of Salt Lake City, which took place at Richfield, Tuesday Jan, 3rd (1933), Immediately following the ceremony the newlyweds left for a ten day visit in southern California. Grace is one of Manti’s popular young ladies, having been active in the social life of our city. She is a graduate of the High School and also Snow College, and for the past number of years has been teaching at Gunnison. Mr. Larsen is at present working for the State Road Commission at Parawan, After March Ist the young couple will make their home in Salt Lake City.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie stayed on keeping the hotel in Manti for another three and a half years, with the help of David and Max. Then she decided to sell out and move to Salt Lake City, where some of her older children were then residing. She bought a home at 636 East 3rd South in Salt Lake. A letter to Gladys about the last of April 1936 follows:— “Dear Gladys: … Uncle Albert was down Saturday to see me about my abstract of title, etc. We had it all drawn up and thought it all ok, but their attorneys up there said it was not clear - no right of way over the creek and some other flaws. He was supposed to have gone to Salt Lake yesterday to have it all fixed up. I expect a call anytime to go to Salt Lake to close the deal. Can you go up and take care of the house until school closes here? I hate to take Max out of school and the home there should have someone in it. I’ll bring up bedding <span id="page-647"></span> and enough things for you and Margaret to get along until we move, which will be in a couple of weeks.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We are awfully busy. Steve and Chris are here besides a number of other men. One thing sure, the Wimmer folks will take over a housefull. We have a nice service station now on the corner and Rastus is moving his dump away. Grace was home most of last week. I surely hope Rosy is having some business but somehow I worry about them. I stayed home all day Sunday and worked as usual. Dave had the car. He at last has found a job (making brick) now that we are ready to move. Such weather - it’s awful today - cold and stormy. Don’t do anything about moving until you see or hear from me again. Would you be afraid to live in the home until we come?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After nearly eleven and a half years as oper- ator and manager of the Eagle House Hotel in Manti, Millie took up her residence in Salt Lake City. But she did not remain unemployed long, for she accepted a position with Auerbach’s Company in the alterations. department and remained in their employ for some seven years. On Mar. 1940 she married Octavious F. Gudmundson, an engineer on the U. P. railroad. The family all called him “Goodie” and welcomed him into the fold.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grace writes: - “The big home mother bought in Salt Lake proved to be a gathering place for children and grandchildren. David had graduated from Manti High School and Max attended West High there in Salt Lake. Douglas and I had moved to Salt Lake and were also living with mother. Gladys also lived with mother and remained there until 1942, when she left for San Francisco, Our daughter Maxine Sydney was born while we were living there, 17 Oct. 1943. We had brother Max as her godfather for he was by that time in the Navy and on the aircraft carrier Enterprise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In August 1950 Doug and I bought our present home on Emerson Ave. Soon after mother sold her big home and purchased a duplex near Liberty Park, 1333 South 6th East. David and his family bought and lived in one side of the duplex and mother and Goodie in the other. Goodie died there <span id="page-648"></span> 20 Aug. 1951.” His obituary notice was as follows: - “Octavious F, Gudmundson, 75, retired U. P. worker dies at Salt Lake residence, 1333 South 6th East. Born 7 May 1876 in Fairview, Utah, a son of Samuel and Inger Olsen Gudmundson, Filled a mission for the Church to Norway, 1900-1903. Married lst. Anna Mae Clark (div.); md, 2nd Millie Gledhill Christensen. Died 20 Aug. 1951; buried 24 Aug. 1951.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie had numerous friends in Salt Lake and she continued to remain active, She was always most thoughtful and considerate of her many relatives and never missed an opportunity to be of service to them. She was a member of the McKay Ward, Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and the “Silver Crest Club”, a social group of ladies whom she enjoyed very much. They had such good times together. Though Millie’s later years were saddened by the death of her son Wesley, at 48, the grueling service of her son Max during the second world war as a crewman of the aircraft carrier Enterprise, which had ten announced battles to its credit, including the raid on Tokyo, and his long illness that resulted as well as the serious illness of her son Melrose, yet she kept her courage and went forward, doing all she could for her family and friends. Her own health remained comparatively - good and she continued to keep very busy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She passed away rather suddenly at her home of cardiac failure, Wed. Nov. 1, 1961 at 2 p.m. She was seventy-nine years eight months and six days old, She had outlived her husband Arthur twenty-nine years lacking one month. She was survived by three sons and two daughters, twelve grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers. Funeral services were held at the Mortuary at 36 East 7th South in Salt Lake City at 10 a.m. Sat. 4 Nov, 1961 and burial was later that day in the Manti City Cemetery, where she was placed beside her beloved husband Arthur.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie’s oldest son, Melrose, followed her in death exactly one week to the day (Wed. 8 Nov. 1961) in Salt Lake City. He was buried exactly a week following her burial (Sat, 11 Nov. 1961) in</p>
