  <h2 id="other-dimensions" class="calibre9">OTHER DIMENSIONS <span id="page-38" class="calibre3"></span></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Far back in the history of Denmark, its people must have felt that there was something greater, stronger and more glorious than themselves—something they ought to fear, reverence or worship. Surely this feeling, this belief, this upward urge was a part of the makeup of our first Danes, as it was with other prehistoric peoples, and as it is with us. Of course there would have been the doubting Thomases, the self-sufficient—or shall we call them skeptics—who live by the rule of the known dimensions and never take stock in anything they cannot see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or perhaps heft. These there will always be: the individuals, through whose well-walled thinking “the intangibles” never filter nor do they leave any mark upon the conduct of their lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Palle Lauring, in his book “A History of the Kingdom of Denmark” (from which so much of the information about this country was taken) has this to say about the Danes first—shall we call it religion? </p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">Among prehistoric Danes, apparently whether anything went right or wrong, was a question of fate. The powers-that-be decided one’s luck and thus one had to pacify them, protect oneself against them and, if possible, be on good terms with them. There was hardly a question yet of real gods. Spirits lived in streams and marshes, and offerings to them were made everywhere. The woodland lakes were black and dangerous, so earthenware vessels containing food and amber pearls were lowered into the bogs and marsh ponds; magnificent great stone axes were consigned to the streams; meat was deposited on sacred stones; and in spring and autumn, the all-important periods when all matters were decided, it is likely that sacrificial-feasts were arranged.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">…At the same time there was some thinking being done about the dead. They should be allowed to take what was theirs along with them when they were buried, for in the next life they might need their things. Nobody wanted the dead to come back in order to claim their property—the dead were dangerous. So weapons and jewelry, <span id="page-39"></span> etc., were buried with corpses… When the farmer replaced the hunter there was a new type of thinking, or what we might call a ‘new religion’. To plough the earth was to cause it pain, to clear the forest was to offend it; therefore, sacrifices had to be made to trees and stones and you had to be friends with the sun. (Nothing was known of the chemistry of the soil or of the sprouting of seeds or plant diseases.) Whenever anything went right or wrong, it was fate!</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Nordic mythology was the only religion of the Scandinavians for ten centuries. This form of believing followed the “fate” period among these norsemen. When the Danes and their colleagues began to feel a little better acquainted with the vast unknown, the spirits, whom they feared or worshiped, took the forms of legendary people, gods and goddesses and demigods galore, to whom they paid their respects. Some of the days of the week were named after various of these; for Wednesday was for Wodin or Odin, who ruled in the heavens, the great all-father god of these early Danes. They thought he lived in a palace made of gold and silver, called Valhalla. Two ravens stood on his shoulders and he sent them to fly around the earth to give him news of all they saw and heard. Round him stood maidens with helmets, spears and shields, called Valkyries, who were sent down to earth to bring the souls of heros slain in battle to feast forever with Odin in his great hall Valhalla. When the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, in the course of a wild storm, Danes would say, eyeing the sky, “There goes the mighty Odin and his warriors riding into battle in their great carts, lashing their steeds.” Thursday got its name from Thor, the strongest of Nordic gods, who had a great hammer which no man could lift, a pair of powerful gloves and a belt which, when fastened round him, doubled his strength. Sometimes when the thunder roared it was not Odin riding, but “Thor banging his huge hammer”. Friday was named for Frigga, wife of Odin and goddess of marriage, supreme among all the Danes’ goddesses. The rainbow in the sky was the bridge by which the gods rode to their home, Asgard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-40"></span> Early Christian monks were said to have visited Denmark, but with no success. During the course of the Viking raids on England, the Danes were often “exposed” to the influence of Christianity but it was more or less like “casting pearls before swine”. It is said some Vikings even permitted themselves to be “marked with the sign of the cross”, prior to baptism, when they were in foreign climes but that when they came back home they “washed off the baptism” and once more paid their respects to Odin and Thor. “It was not because their souls were false but simply because they regarded Christ as God in western Europe and therefore it was as well to be on good terms with him while in his countries. But at home in Scandinavia, Thor and Odin were still gods and naturally one couldn’t fail them.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark’s king, Harold Bluetooth, personally became converted to the Christian faith and tore down his father’s old pagan altar at Jelling and built a church. He tried to convert his people to Christianity but it was impossible to convert a whole nation of tradition-bound pagans all at once and he had little success. Canute the Great became a devout Christian. His greatest triumph, outside of the establishing of his fantastic North Sea Empire, was when, on Easter Sunday 1027, “he strolled up the aisle of St. Peters in Rome beside Conrad (who was that day crowned Emperor), as his guest of honor and witness”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But the Danes were still heathens, worshiping their pagan gods, for almost a thousand years after the first solid Christian churches were established by the early monks in western Europe. It wasn’t until King Sweyn Estridson took a hand that the Danes began to be Christians to any great extent. Under him the Danish Catholic bishoprics became firmly established, the churches became extraordinarily numerous and the area divided up into ecclesiastical parishes. Stone church buildings appeared everywhere (the first ones had been of wood). These were mostly austere, stern and simple, like the old Anglo-Saxon ones in England; but in Funen and Jutland they were ornamented with a ponderous type of primitive sculpture, among <span id="page-41"></span> the most impressive created in Europe at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the most prominent Middle-Age Christians in Denmark was Archbishop Absalom, who served during the Great Period of the Valdemars. He wrote the Danish chronicals from which have been gleaned so much of Denmark’s early history and folklore. Then, the Danish Christian church was ruled under the direction of the Pope at Rome. Of the more than 1,700 parish churches existing in Denmark today, roughly 1,500 date from the Valdemar period or before. Big cathedrals grew more numerous then also; but, though there were churches a plenty, they were not able to eradicate the Danes ancient thinking about many things. Their verses still contained tales of mermaids and water sprites and stories of the dead returning to haunt the living; maidens flying to their loves in suits of feathers (transformed into birds); men having raven-spells and flying by night; and fairies dancing in the meadows and dwelling in ancient grave mounds and, if they invited a young swain to come to them and he resisted and fled, they took most fearful revenge!</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Trouble between Church and State had been going on in much of Europe for ages but it really didn’t begin in Denmark till around 1250 and from then on, for the next two-and-a-half centuries, there was trouble between Danish rulers and the bishops. Good terms between these two forces were re-established about 1500, when it became the custom to award most of the high posts in the church to Danish noblemen who supported the Crown. The Danish Catholic Church then became very rich, especially in real estate, and its chief activity took on more the nature of grandiose estate management than religious service. All churches, both large and small, were lavishly decorated with expensive murals in glowing colors, art and woodcarvings, mostly imported, golden altar pieces of beaten gilded copper. The monasteries were prospering too. But among the peasants, ancient pagan beliefs refused to disappear and <span id="page-42"></span> relics of their old heathen cults were still to be observed for, after all, “Rome was far away”. On “Wakeful Nights” the young men and girls of the villages went to the churches, taking their beer casks with them, and danced and made merry. Night life in the churches was not exactly Christian, “but to avoid offending the images of the pious saints on such occasions, their pictures were turned with their faces to the wall”. Thus, though there was no longer a gap between Church and State in Denmark, there was a big one between the Church and its congregations. An extensive feeling of unrest in religious matters was felt as the Danish Catholic Church’s hold upon the population slackened.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So there was not much to stop the new religious doctrines of the reformer, Martin Luther, which were then being formulated in Germany, from seeping into Denmark and the existing church there was unable to strangle them. Fanaticism and mass excitement in religious movements were uncommon in the Dane’s history, for there was usually cool sobriety among them where religion was concerned. Then, too, at this time the Danes had the “Counts War” to think about—war was another thing! When the bloodshed was finally over, the death knell of the Catholic Church in Denmark was sounded. King Christian III proclaimed Lutheranism as the religion in his land and all who opposed him were forced to give in. Though all Catholic bishops were imprisoned in one swoop, they were released on condition that they get out of the country or join the Lutheran Church. Most of them stayed and changed over. Acts of violence were few and the struggle was nearly over. Now all these new Lutheran clergy were required to do was to perform their religious duties and keep their noses out of other matters—no more land grabbing or politics! Thus the Reformation was carried out rather simply in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When absolute monarchy was introduced in 1660 the Danish churches became the property of the State and Lutheranism became the national religion of the kingdom. All Danish subjects <span id="page-43"></span> were required to belong to this State Church and baptism was compulsory. This law was rigidly in effect for the next 189 years. On 5 June 1849 an assembly of great significance to the people of Denmark was held in Copenhagen, for it was then that their new constitution was signed. Among this document’s stipulations was one regarding religious tolerance. The Danes had taken a great step toward freedom once again! It had taken a long, long time to prepare the land of Denmark and her people for the coming of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to her shores.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Four months later another assembly of great importance to the Danes was being held thousands of miles to the west. It was harvest time in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, but in that two-year-old community on the American frontier the main interest of its inhabitants was not in the fields of golden grain but in the October Conference then in session in the completely filled Bowery. Here on this late autumn day, 7 October 1849, the emphasis turned to missionary work. A passage from the Bible (Rev. 14:6) was read:— “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” This prophesy, believed to be the destiny of the new church whose members were gathered there, could be fulfilled only if more foreign missionaries were sent out. The Latter-Day Saint church had opened the British Mission in 1837 and the South Pacific Island Mission in 1843, but this had been only a start. It was felt that now was the time to expand the program. Members in attendance held their breaths, so to speak, as name after name was read out as having been selected to go on a foreign mission—to France, Italy, Great Britain, the Society Islands—and Elders John E. Forsgren to Sweden and Erastus Snow and Peter O. Hansen to Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since winter was about to close in and wagon trails east would be treacherous, if not impassable, the group were given but twelve days to prepare <span id="page-44"></span> themselves and their families for the long separation. The company was organized for traveling and on 19 Oct. 1849 left the Salt Lake Valley, number- ing 35 men, 12 wagons, 1 carriage, and 42 horses and mules, This was the first company of missionaries sent from the Rocky Mountains, The journey proved long, tiring, and at times even dangerous. On Monday Nov. 12th the group was attacked by about two hundred Cheyenne warriors, on the Platte River, but escaped unhurt. On Friday, Dec, 7th, after two months, during which time an over-ruling Providence was clearly made manifest in their behalf, the missionaries arrived at Ft. Kearney on the Missouri River. It took another five months before Elder Peter O. Hansen arrived in Copenhagen (11 May 1850) the first L. D. S. missionary to ever set foot on Danish soil. A native of Denmark, he hoped to convert his own people and some of his friends, but they would have none of it. On 14 June he was joined by Elders George P. Dykes, John E. Forsgren and Erastus Snow, the latter to serve as president of the infant mission, with Elder Hansen as interpreter. The four humble missionaries immediately shut themselves up in the upper room of a hotel in Copenhagen, where they offered a prayer of thanksgiving for their safe arrival and dedicated themselves to the service of the Lord; while ribald carousers held forth in a bar directly below far into the night. At that time Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland were placed under the “Scandinavian Mission” with headquarters in Denmark’s capitol city, and remained so until divided in 1905 and the “Copenhagen Branch” was Organized, with headquarters in Copenhagen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So the gospel seed was sown in Denmark, for better or for worse, and on 12 August 1850 the harvest of souls began. On this date the first Danish L.D.S. baptisms in this dispensation took place when 15 candidates, mostly Baptists, entered the clear waters of Oresund, immediately outside Copenhagen, and received this important ordinance. In writing to the First Pre sidency, August 17th, Elder Snow Said, “The Lord has visited the believers with many visions and dreams and manifestations of the Holy Spirit. They have <span id="page-45"></span> drawn out of us, by their faith, everything pertaining to the gathering, the redemption of the dead, etc., and drink it in as an ox drinketh up water…” Later he told how some of the early investigators there had seen the Elders in vision and knew them on arrival. And again, reporting to the authorities in Zion he wrote, “As far as my experience and observation extends, the Danes are a kind, hospitable people, especially the middle classes, and higher tone or morality pervades here than exists in corresponding classes in England and America; and if I mistake not my feelings, the Lord has many people among them.” On the 25th Nov., a second Danish branch of the Restored Church was organized, the “Aalborg Branch” in northern Jutland, with headquarters in the city of Aalborg. (This has been in continued existence ever since and is still one of the largest and best branches of the LDS Church in the Scandinavian countries.) By the close of the year 1850 there were about 135 members of the new church in Denmark and things seemed to be going pretty well for them and their church there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But opposing forces were stirring and preparing for battle. It seemed certain that the same unhallowed persecutions which followed the preaching of the gospel in ancient days would become an integral part of the experience of these nineteenth century disciples, even here among the liberty-loving Danes. The Clergy of Denmark’s State Church brought all the anti-Mormon falsehoods that they could find from America and England and after inventing a few of their own, inveigled the Danish press to join in the campaign against these so-called “Mormons”. Even the Bishop of Zealand, ranking Bishop of the Lutheran Church in Denmark, issued a pamphlet which catalogued the usual filth against them. Here is a quotation from an article which appeared at the time on the front page of “The Tidende”, one of the most popular and respected Danish newspapers in Copenhagen, claimed to be reprinted from a paper in Paris which had printed it straight from a paper in London:—</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">It is reported on good authority that missionaries from a church which calls itself by the grandiose title of the “Church of Jesus Christ <span id="page-46"></span> of Latter-Day Saints” (known as Mormons from the title of a so-called new Bible they call the Book of Mormon) is now sending representatives to proselytize in Denmark. For the past dozen years these Mormons, who style themselves also Saints, have been preaching with good success among the lower classes of England. We feel it our duty to issue warnings to our brothers in the north countries, having discovered for ourselves the nefarious purposes to which these men have put their religious teachings. They are recruiting whatever members of the European working and peasant classes they can find, who are ignorant enough to listen and be influenced, taking them to American West where they are treated as indentured. servants.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">… Some thirty-five thousand converts in thirteen years have been made in England, of which more than five thousand have emigrated already to a barren wilderness they have the affrontery to call ‘Zion’, as if the wandering children of God were being taken home according to the prophecies in the Old Testament… We need hardly to point out that this is a most lucrative business for the so-called Authorities in America. They have now begun to charter whole ships, which sail out of Liverpool, their agents profiting from ship and railroad rebates, as well as excess baggage charges, while they fleece the poor and ignorant emigrants at every step. But this is only the beginning of the profit, of course, for the priesthood on the other side of the Atlantic, and we are appalled to consider the possibilities, once these poor people are forced to labor as they are told or die in the wilderness. Assistance is given them to leave their homes, but none to return.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">This is an appalling story, a church that dares to give itself a Christian name, proposing to take the poor of the earth into an earthly heaven and then, for unquestionable obedience, to eternal rewards. Instead, the faces of the emigrants are ground into the earth, ‘tithes of time and toil’ are exacted from them, and their labor is exploited, while they struggle to repay their debt to the agents who persuaded them to the enterprise. <span id="page-47"></span></p>

    <p class="calibre1">There are well-founded rumors here that not only are the poor exploited in Utah—called the ‘Promised Land’ by these erstwhile missionaries even now preaching on our streets—but that young women are especially susceptible to their ideas (as young women will forever be when men are good looking and unscrupulous, with money in their pockets) and are later forced, by poverty and desperation, when they are once in America, into illegal marriages with the so-called ‘Apostles’ of the Mormon Church.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Blasts against the infant church continued coming from press and pulpit. The Elders in Denmark decided not to answer these charges openly but to go on quietly holding their meetings, improving themselves in the language, and aiding Elder Hansen in the Danish translation of the Book of Mormon (whose sheets finally came off the press 22 May 1951). They did not advertise their meetings but they continued to be filled at the appointed hours, not only with faithful members and sincere seekers of the truth, but with ruffians and others who were there for no good purpose at all. The opposing clergy labored with students of church-sponsored schools to join apprentices and the rough-necks who attended the Mormon services, to break up the meetings, and this they often did; but that isn’t all they broke up, as the following quotes from “History of the Scandinavian Mission”, by Andrew Jenson, indicate:—</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">While visiting with a few Saints in Vendsyssel, Elder Dykes, who had been having great success in the Aalborg Conference, was met by a mob, who beat him and threatened his life. The ruffians broke all the windows in the house in which he was visiting and the tile came crashing from the roof as the house was generally demolished. But with the aid of some friendly women he escaped through the back way and returned to Aalborg. Attacks of this kind were not unusual against all the brethren but these men were not easily discouraged and they found many of the honest in heart for whom they were seeking, in spite of all the angry rumblings.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Sunday, 22 June 1851</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">Elder Hans Peter Jensen and his missionary brethren announced a <span id="page-48"></span> public baptismal service to take place in the open waters of the Limfjord, near Aalborg. A great number of people gathered to witness the event. Before proceeding with the ceremony, Elders Jensen and Christian J. Larsen spoke to the assembled multitude, advising them to flee from “the Church of the Devil”, intimating that the Lutheran Clergy represented that church. Bedlam broke loose and the Elders were dragged by the mob before a prominent clergyman of the city. The mob went to the Saints meeting house, broke all the windows and tore the doors down. Soldiers were ordered out that night to restore a semblance of order, but before their arrival a severe thunderstorm broke, the likes of which had seldom been seen in Aalborg, and the mob scattered… For six nights more the depredations were repeated, with the mob intent on almost any crime; but a check on all missionaries and members later disclosed that, while there were bruises and tales of narrow escapes by the missionaries who had been at their wits end, all had escaped serious personal harm.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Nov. 1851</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">A mob, fanned to white heat by their own fanaticism, burned the home of Jacob Bohn, chanting ‘Let’s baptise the Mormon Priest in his own blood’ soon after it was discovered that he had joined the LDS church as the first convert in Randers. But Brother Bohn came back after the fire and praised God that his journal, containing about fifty hymns he had written, had not been destroyed.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">On Sunday, 14th Dec. 1851, four of the brethren held a meeting at Brondbjoster, a suburb of Copenhagen, and many of the Saints had come out from the Capitol City to attend the services.</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">… As soon as the meeting was dismissed and the visitors began to disperse and start on their return trip to Copenhagen, they were greeted with a shower of stones, potatoes and other missiles, from a crowd which lay in ambush waiting for them. After proceeding a little farther, someone gave a signal that the Saints were coming, and when they came within the firing line they received another salvo of <span id="page-49"></span> potatoes and stones. Still farther on, men and women, who had posted themselves along the hedges and in trenches, came out to take an active part in the unequal battle between the Saints and sinners. Some of the assailants were armed with heavy sticks and clubs, and stones and dirt flew thick and fast. Some of the women carried missiles in their aprons with which to supply their male companions, while they, in a blasphemous manner, cried out, ‘Now call on your God to defend you!’ Some of the brethren were knocked down and rolled in the muddy road and beaten with sticks and fists; their coats were torn to pieces in several instances and even one of the Sisters was abused and handled very roughly. For more than half a mile the mob pursued the Saints in this manner, and when they at last came to a farm house by the roadside and sought shelter within, they were not safe there either and fled across the fields in the darkness, still pursued by their “Christian” friends, until they reached another farmhouse where they also sought shelter. But its occupants refused; however, a friendly- disposed girl kindly showed them a way out through the garden into the fields, and they finally escaped from their pursuers.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the sufferers said of this occasion,</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">

    <p class="calibre1">For three quarters of an hour we were seemingly in the hands of the devil, but while God permitted him to have power over our flesh, our spirits rejoiced, for we knew we suffered for the cause of truth. One cannot describe the suffering we passed through, but for a short time it certainly looked as if none of us would escape with our lives.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">The missionaries and Saints in Denmark never fought back to save their lives, but were advised to follow the admonitions of the Savior, who said, —“When they persecute you in one City, flee to another”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the membership of the new church grew, so did the persecutions—everywhere in Denmark. The Elders appealed to the Mayors of the cities and to the police, but received little satisfaction. The ruling authorities, though claiming to be in favor of religious freedom as a principle, could not agree as far as the Mormons were concerned; and though the new Danish Constitution guaranteed. <span id="page-50"></span> the right of freedom of religion, it was not backed up by the collateral laws nor by the moral force of the country. Since street meetings were prohibited by law, and public meetings curtailed or broken up, the Saints had to hold their gatherings in private and often in secret. (It was worse in Norway and Sweden where there were no laws at all aimed at religious liberty.) Sometimes the meetings were held in people’s barns. Numerous ones were started when ordinary citizens were asleep, and not until the call of the nightingale heralded the coming of dawn did the meetings close. If mission- aries were accused of infractions, such as holding meetings when forbidden, preaching the gospel, baptising or what have you, they were taken before the various authorities and fined for the crimes of practicing their beliefs. If they didn’t or couldn’t pay the fines they were jailed in lieu of these, and fed on bread and water; then they were just as apt to hold meetings in the jails as not. After being released they would immediately start preaching again and continue until re-arrested on the same charges. Sometimes mob action became so violent, seemingly with police consent, that meetings had to be discontinued entirely for periods of months; but the Saints went steadily on, praying in their own homes; the missionaries went quietly on associating with and preaching to the members in their homes; and the mobs, made up mostly of men and boys, continued to meet in greater numbers for a time, but had to be content to spend their fury on themselves and the rented meetinghouses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In some parts of the countryside in the mission, citizens joined in a conspiracy not to sell anything to Mormons or to hire anyone who was known to have been baptised. Children of Mormons were mocked and mistreated in school and the Lutheran Clergy advertised the names of new Mormon converts so that they could be shunned and hated by their fellowmen. Anti-Mormon pamphlets, filled with misrepresentations and falsehoods, were continually being published and caused considerable opposition to the work of the Lord in Denmark. There was much hostility toward the Saints in most places. But despite the seemingly untiring efforts of all opposing forces combined, <span id="page-51"></span> the LDS church continued to grow and prosper in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the General Conference of the new church, held in Copenhagen in April 1853, it was announced that membership in the Scandinavian Mission then numbered 1,331, of which 1,133 were Danish, 88 Norwegian and 110 Swedish. Baptisms of members were well over a thousand for each of the years 1856, 1857, 1858. At the close of the year 1859 the Mission contained 3,934 baptised members of the Restored Church, 2,512 in Denmark. These were over and above the over 2,000 who had emi- grated to Zion, the 460 who had “lost the faith” and been excommunicated, and a number who had passed on. Even members of the national governing bodies themselves began to be alarmed because of the progress of the new church in their midst, and well they might have been. “The local brethren were as apt to hear of the Restored Gospel one day, be baptised on the next, and on the third be called, as likely as not, as ‘traveling Elders’, every man to warn his neighbor.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Why were conversions so easily made in the Scandinavian Mission? Who can deny that part of the seed of Israel had been scattered in that land of the Norsemen and that the sheep knew the voice of the shepherd? The homeland of these people had been the homeland, as we know, of the early Vikings. It was a more or less common occurrence for the people to find here old battle shields, large stones or other objects with ancient runic writings on them, in the fields or on the sea coasts, These “finds” were often sent to educational institutions where men of higher learning translated them and published the findings. Was it not then simple enough and logical also for many Scandinavian people to believe the stories that the missionaries told of golden and brass plates found in a hillside in distant America? And when found by a young, Prophet, was it not perfectly natural that he should translate the writings found thereon and have them published? And so they believed!</p>
