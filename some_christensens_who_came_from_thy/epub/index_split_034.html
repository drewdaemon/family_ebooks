  <p class="calibre1">After the last rites and burial for their eldest son Christian, age fifty, were ended, Laurs and Else gathered with many of their descendants at the red brick home in North Gunnison, then owned by their youngest son and his wife, Arthur and Millie. Of course Arthur and Millie and their children, Melrose, Wesley, Grace, Gladys and David, were all there, as were Joseph, Roxie and their offspring, Harold, Ruth Ellen, Myron, Virgil, Marvin and nine-months-old Don. Andrew and Sarah had come up from the LaVerkin area in southern Utah’s Dixie with their entire family, <span id="page-442"></span> then including Edith, Wendell, Sheldon, Luther and Lucile; while Albert had come from Manti, bringing with him his five motherless children, Virginia, Elaine, Sherman, Hale and Phillip. Emma and Charles and their three children, Byron, Ada and Imelda were all present. Louis and Florence had brought all their seven with them from Wyoming, LaFaun, Lucien, Rex, Dale, Weldon, Alice and baby Rose, six months old and youngest of the group. With Louis and his family were guests from Lyman, Wyoming, Bishop Clarence Rollins, who had spoken at the funeral, and his daughter Ada.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caroline and her children, Pearl, Elmer, Roy, Ivy, Farrald and Gordon, were not in attendance at this Christensen family gathering, for they had left as soon as possible after the services to return to their home in Salt Lake City. Elsie and her five youngsters, A. Owen, Edgar, Clifton, Edith and Ellamae, had also left right away to return to Wyoming, and Vena had gone back with them since her husband George had been unable to accompany her to Gunnison and she undoubtedly wished to rejoin him as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else and the others were likely disappointed at not getting them to stay for the taking of a family group picture. But they went ahead with the picture nevertheless, all of those present standing out in front of the red brick house. Laurs and Else both looked their full seventy years, for Christian’s death had been a great shock to them. Most looked sad or thoughtful in the picture that was taken that 12th of October 1917, but Aunt Roxie’s sweet face coming up like a full moon over Grandfather’s shoulder helped to brighten it up some. It must have been hard to realize at the time that it had been ten whole years since their last family group picture had been taken. There were a number of new faces on this one - but some were missing, and not just because they had not stayed to be taken.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We can imagine that part of the discussion carried on among the adults at this gathering was concerning their getting together oftener. Life was so uncertain and time so precious and it</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-443"></span> moved along so rapidly. In seventy years one had only 25,000 days and 600,000 hours to use and cherish. There was no time to waste on useless and shoddy things, only time for the best; and what could be better than for a family to spend it together enjoying each other while yet there was time in which to do it? They talked of having a family reunion the very next summer and likely a committee was appointed to plan it and all pledged to be present. And then they separated, each family going its way, doubtless with renewed resolve at least to see their dear progenitors more often and to keep in touch and cheer them on in their declining years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A month and a half later, 29 Nov. 1917, Laurs went into the Manti Temple and did the endowment work in behalf of his beloved son Christian. Six days after that, 5 Dec. 1917, Caroline and five of her living children went with Laurs and Else to the Salt Lake Temple. Here Caroline had her own endowments that day and Else did the same work for the deceased Elora. Then all of Christian’s and Caroline’s family, both the living and the dead, were sealed together for eternity, all but Pearl, and Laurs stood for Christian while Else stood for Elora. Those on the other side must have rejoiced on that occasion, and those on this side of the veil who understood rejoiced too.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elvena (Vena) came back to her parents’ home in Manti to have her first baby. Her mother Else took care of her. She was past thirty-one years old and according to Tresia she had a very hard time. The little girl was born 12 July 1918 and was given the name Vera. Vena was not yet up and around when the Christensens began gathering for their family reunion, nor was she able to join to any extent in the festivities. We do not know if George was able to come, but probably not as he was usually with the herds of the Bennion Livestock Company, and with a new member in the family to provide for felt unable to miss his work and the income it provided.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This family reunion was quite an affair, according to the record kept by the then nearly <span id="page-444"></span> sixteen year old Elaine in her journal, from which we are fortunate to be able to copy:— “Sat. July 19, 1918, Cousin Edith Christensen came down from Provo to Grandmother’s, for the reunion… Sun. July 20, We went to the train to meet all the folks and were disappointed to find only A. Owen… Mon. July 21, was the starting of the Christensen Family Reunion. As soon as we got breakfast over with we all got cleaned up and Edith and Ruth Ellen, who were staying with us, and Virginia and I went up to Grandma’s where (Oh joy!) were all of Uncle Lou’s folks, LaFaun, etc., and Mr. Rollins, Ada Rollins, Jim Rollins, Bob Blackner, Uncle Andrew and Aunt Sarah’s family, and all the Gunnison folks. Later there were fifty of us for dinner at our house. Then we had a program where Bob Blackner sang ‘Sunshine of Your Smile’ and ‘Somewhere a Voice is Calling’. Then the men folks did the dishes and cleaned up the house while LaFaun, Edith, Ruth Ellen, Lucile, Virginia and I went jitney riding. Next we went to have some ice cream with A. Owen, Bob and Jim. That night, with the lights on the lawn and the Victrola going, we had a family dancing party. But that let out about 9:30, so LaFaun, Ada Rollins, Virginia and I went to the dance up town for ½ hour. That night we slept four in a bed… Tues. July 23, The family went to Funk’s Lake. Ruth Ellen, LaFaun, Virginia, Ada, Jim, A. Owen, Bob and I went out in the Ford and had two blowouts on the way. We had a fine time at the lake, eating, catching cats and boat riding. That night we had another dancing party on our lawn and served punch… Wed. July 24, We went in the jitney to Gunnison to the Twenty-fourth of July patriotic program where Bob Blackner sang ‘The Flag Without a Stain’ and ‘Keep the Home Fires Burning’. Then came a nap and then dinner. After dinner the family had a meeting. It was the grandest meeting. There were tears in everybody’s eyes. Then we went to see the races. We went to the Twenty-fourth of July dance in Manti at night … Thur. July 25, We went down to the depot to see a group of soldiers off to war and then came home to see the Wyoming folks off - all but A. Owen. Sure is lonesome here.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By the first part of November that year it was <span id="page-445"></span> rumored that in Europe the “war to end all wars”, the worst war, the bloodiest war in history, was almost over. Soon it was all over over there and the boys were coming home! Cheering, flag waving crowds, with bands playing, were at hundreds of railroad stations throughout the length and breadth of the United States to welcome home their heroes. Cousin Elmer Christensen, Christian’s and Caroline’s eldest son, was among those to return from the First World War. Though he joined the service not too long before the end of hostilities and didn’t get into the actual fighting, he was however, as far as we can learn, the only one of Laurs and Else’s descendants to get into it at all. How thankful they must have been when the threat was at last ended.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Though Laurs and Else had kept up occasional correspondence with their loved ones in Denmark ever since their return from there in 1910, this had been almost entirely disrupted during the war and for some time after. They wrote again when the great war was over, and in April 1920 received two letters from Jutland in return; one from Else’s sister Marie and one from her sister Karen. A translation of each follows: “Skovlyst 21, Thisted, Denmark 26 Mar. 1920</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Loved Ones:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thanks for the letters we received; they are passed around among us. Mikkel and Karen were here and Karen read the card for me while I rested on the sofa. I have to rest my legs since their support is not always strong. But I will say thanks to my Father in Heaven that I can still move about and take care of myself. I cannot stretch my strength as far as you can but I am happy and contented and I receive a little more to live on and this is good as everything is so expensive.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our sister Stine died the 18 March (1920) and was buried the 23 March. I believe she was not as satisfied spiritually as could be desired, Of course it can come to both old and young. But <span id="page-446"></span> now she is released from the earthly life and we are sure she departed in the belief of the three-in-one God (Trinity). We have heard so little about them since, but it was pneumonia which took her life. She couldn’t stand it with her asthma. The doctor that came also knew she couldn’t live. It was strange that she should be so far away from us when the end came, but all was well for her with husband and children. New construction was being done [in Frederikssund] last summer, and it was all good for them. While that was underway, they were with the children in Copenhagen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The eldest son, Holger, a carpenter and married, has 2 children, a son and a daughter, and the happy youngest daughter, Stinne, is married to a trolley operator, a solid, good man from Fyn. They have three delightful children, 2 boys and a girl. They were there until everything was finished in the Frederikssund Cooperative, of which Viggo is the manager and Dagmar the housekeeper. They had taken care of all the support, and now our brother-in-law Svend remains alone behind.<sup id="fnref:10" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Old Mrs. Vagner, born Jessen, is still living. She has been so near death and is so feeble but is up and around again. She had been to see sister Stine. They lived together awhile many years ago. I used to visit her once in a while. She’s poor now though she was an only daughter from Lyngholm and a grocer’s widow. We are so much better off, we children of Anders Kristjan the houseman. Yes, father did well - long live his memory.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Yes dear sister, you can be sure we Danish pray and hope for our brothers and sisters of the southland. The Germans can continue to be, as Gruntdvig said in his talk, ‘our burden.’ That is true, but we believe true and fast that everything stands in God the Father’s hands and in that belief we live and are happy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our Edel is happy. She has a daughter and son. I am going to travel there in April and hold Easter in Jesus’ name; Thousands of Greetings. Marie”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thorsted, Denmark 28 Mar. 1920 “Dear Sister: <span id="page-447"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Right at first, many thanks for being so kind to write to us; it is a great joy to us. I have now read Marie’s letter to you and see that she has written about what we know of sister’s sickness and death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“About the first part of March Viggo and Aksel Poulsen, who lives in Aarhus, were here for a visit<sup id="fnref:11" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:11">11</a></sup> and Viggo said at the time that ‘mother is becoming better than father.’ So it was a surprise for us when we saw Stine’s death announced in the newspaper. We decided we would not send a letter to you until we knew something about her last days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“April lst, Dear Sister:— We have now had a letter from Svend and that we are all happy and thankful for. Sister was not real sick for more than eight days. The Dr. was there on Wednesday and he said that she would have to have someone with her. That was taken care of and so she lay and had it good. Dagmar was with her and lay down in Svend’s bed and they talked together for one hour before Stine passed away, which we have very much to be thankful for.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sister Marie was here for Easter and we had it very good in spite of what disrupts both in and out of our little land. I think that you certainly know the latest happenings in Copenhagen. Yes dear sister I was better to write this time; of course there was enough to write about. I will with words say that all in the family have it good. Herewith will I bid you farewell, and may God’s peace be with you all. —Karen Skaarup.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alas, separations come and all must travel the way of death. Though last partings are grievous, none can escape them. There is an earthly end to everything, both bad and good and sooner or later every living body must lie down to sleep the exhausted sleep of the dead for a time. So Ane Kirstine “Stine” Andersen Poulsen had passed on at seventy-one years five months and six days, the first one of the Andersen brothers and sisters from Jutland to go since Christen. Else received a copy of some verses that had been written and sung at the silver wedding <span id="page-448"></span> anniversary festival held years before in honor of Stine and Svend. In part, they went like this:</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">“Svend Poulsen, the bridegroom, came to work <br class="calibre4"/> on Mikkel Skaarup’s farm. <br class="calibre4"/> He came not with sword but with axe on his <br class="calibre4"/> shoulder and a saw in his hand. <br class="calibre4"/> He was a fine worker and smiled a lot. <br class="calibre4"/></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Stine Andersen, the bride, had a courageous, <br class="calibre4"/> loving heart <br class="calibre4"/> And a happy, pleasant nature. <br class="calibre4"/> These two met, but how they met and fell <br class="calibre4"/> in love <br class="calibre4"/> Only they themselves know.” —Yes, there had been happier days!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">In Zion on 23 June that year 1920, the son Albert married again after almost four years as a widower. He was forty-seven and a half and his bride was nearly thirty-five. The two, Miss Myrtle Farnsworth a successful teacher in the Manti High School, and Albert, chose the beautiful St. George Temple in which to be wed. The mothering of his five children was a great challenge and Myrtle was worthy and capable in every way. She took over the responsibilities as wife and mother with optimism and great courage and brought love and devotion, encouragement and great strength into the home. Besides she was an excellent seamstress, a marvelous cook and a splendid housekeeper. Good stepmothers are not easily found but she was one of the best.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Aunt Myrtle”, as many of us lovingly call her, is the only one of our Christensens of the second generation living at this writing (1969). She will soon turn eighty-four and is still a strength and inspiration to us all, not only her own children and theirs, but us stepchildren and ours. There has been no line of distinction drawn between us as far as we can tell. Aunt Myrtle well remembers her father and mother-in-law, Laurs and Else, and admires them greatly, although she found Else a little hard to get acquainted with at first. She related this little incident about her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One day, not long after she had taken up her <span id="page-449"></span> duties as housewife in the Albert Christensen home, she was washing dishes and using a new styled wire dish-dryer in which to dry them, considering this more sanitary than the old dishtowel method besides being a real time saver. Else came to call at that moment and stood in the kitchen doorway watching this operation, hands on hips. Finally she said, “Sarah has von of doze”. Myrtle replied, “Yes I know; she saw mine and liked it so well that she got herself one right away.” Else stood looking for a while and then she stated very positively, “Vell me, I vill alvays vipe my dishes!” There was no “beating around the bush” with Else K. She called a spade a spade and an axe an axe. One always knew where she stood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime Laurs and Else went on with their temple work for their dead kinfolk. In June of 1921 she was privileged to do the work for her dear departed sister Stine in the Manti Temple. She likely hoped to outlive her other sisters and her brother Mads in order to be able to do the same for them when their time came. They were all still living the last of April 1922, when a letter was sent to Laurs and Else from Denmark, by Mads’ youngest daughter, Edel Hvid.<sup id="fnref:12" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:12">12</a></sup> Following is a translation of the same:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Tingstrup, Thisted, Denmark 29 April 1922</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Aunt and Uncle:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thanks for your long, dear letter which we were all so happy to read. Aksel is going to take a trip home in the month of June when it is Uncle Mikkel and Aunt Karen Skaarup’s golden wedding anniversary festival. This is a little late to send you an invitation but it would be fine if you could come and surprise them on this day. It is the longest day of the year (21 June) but you remember that of course - your memory is good.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I will tell you a little about father’s birthday the nineteenth of last March. The day began with delightfully calm, mild weather and sun the whole day. We had five guests for dinner. We had first soup with dumplings and then ox (beef) steak <span id="page-450"></span> and fried chicken, potatoes, yellow root (carrots), red cabbage, red beets, preserves, and pudding for dessert. At 2 o’clock in the afternoon came the family in the Hurup car. There were nine of them altogether so there was a big party here. We drank chocolate and coffee. By evening there were eighteen of us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The day after came our aunts, Karen and Marie. They stayed awhile in the afternoon. By then it had become so cold and had snowed and frozen and it has been very cold ever since. Here there is nothing by way of crops although we are well along in the season. Late congratulations on your birthday! I can remember Elvena writing to me that it was her birthday the 27th of last month. I hope this letter will get to you in time to let you know of Uncle and Aunt Skaarup’s wedding festival.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father was very sick one time during this last winter. He had influenza and a heat rash, but now he is completely well again. He became seventy-seven years old, so of course he is not wholly young any longer. We say thanks to the good God for the time that goes. I hope you are all well. Happy Easter! And loving greetings to you all from Denmark and the Hvid family. —Edel Hvid. P.S. — I was so pleased to receive the newspaper.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, it was good that: Karen and Mikkel could celebrate their golden wedding together; not all were so fortunate - Stine and Svend for instance. But of course Laurs and Else could not go to the celebration. Their days of travel to far-off Denmark were over. Perhaps someday others of their descendants would want to go there. They too had had their 50th wedding anniversary back in April of 1916, but they had no special celebration then. With so many of their family moving to Wyoming about that time it probably just “got lost in the shuffle.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The end of the year of 1922 Laurs got word from Denmark of the death of his brother Christen there on Nov. 27th. Now all of the family of his youth was gone but him. It was a strange feeling to be the last leaf left fluttering on the family tree. <span id="page-451"></span> How very lonely such a man must be who had no companion or children of his own.<sup id="fnref:13" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:13">13</a></sup> How grateful he was for Else and their many descendants!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Else decided to travel and visit all of their children. Laurs was busy helping various ones in Gunnison with their harvests. They were always good to look after him when Else was away. The decision made, Else K, set out and started her visiting in Gunnison with Emma, Charles and their three youngsters. Then she spent a little time there with Arthur and Millie, who now had five, the youngest, Max, soon three years old. Joseph and Roxie always welcomed Grandma at their place. They still had their four youngest boys at home. Harold and Ruth Ellen were married but both lived in Gunnison. Else was able to get a look at four of her great-grandsons while there, for Harold and his wife Herma had three little boys, the youngest, Clair, not more than ten days old, and Ruth Ellen and her husband, Frank Hansen, had little Duane, fourteen and a half months old.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Else went to Goshen where Elsie and Elvena and their families lived. Elsie and Alma now had six living children, three sons and three daughters, LaPreal, now two and a half years old, having been their first child in almost nine years. Elvena was expecting her fourth baby and her mother Else must have been real anxious to get to Goshen in time for it so that she could be on hand to help with the three little girls, Vera, Alta and Tresia, until Vena could be up and around again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else likely went from there to Salt Lake City in time to attend some of the sessions of the General October Conference. Heber J. Grant was President of the Church then. She and Laurs had lived under the administrations of Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, and now Heber J. Grant, and known and loved them all. This trip she spent most of her time with her children and their families however. Andrew and Sarah now had the six children living, three boys and three girls, <span id="page-452"></span> like Elsie and Alma. Their Edythe had recently returned from two years of study in Boston.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else also spent time visiting Caroline and her children, those who were around, while there. Pearl, of course, she had likely seen in Goshen. Elmer and Roy were out of the state, working. Roy in particular was a great help to his mother in those days in assisting with the support of the family. Too much can not be said of the faithfulness of this boy in behalf of his widowed mother. Farrald says the family would have had great difficulty making out if it hadn’t been for the financial assistance of this older brother during those trying times, and in fact as long as their mother lived. The three younger children were then at home attending school and Caroline was able to spend some time working in the Salt Lake Temple, which she liked to do. Perhaps Else went through a session with her while there, as she often did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wyoming was Else’s next destination for she had promised Florence she would come and do some quilting for her. Cold weather was coming on and Wyoming was well known for its cold winters. Lewis and Florence were then living in a fine home in Evanston, where he was still county sheriff, and doing well. They now had eight living children, baby Marjorie being two months past a year. But they also had a grandson, since LaFaun was married to Benjamin Slagowski and had a five months old son Louis. Else got to see her fifth great-grandson while in Evanston, for LaFaun came from Lyman, where they were living, to show him off. She and Laurs as yet had no great-granddaughters. She stayed several weeks in Evanston. It was quite a long ways away and she didn’t hope to be able to get there very often in the future.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the first of November came Else had had her visit out and was eager to be on her way home. She had seen most of her descendants, as well as numerous old friends, and she wanted to get back to Manti in time to vote in the coming special election. The train may have seemed to run slowly to Else, homeward bound, for there would be Laurs to greet and tell the news to, and <span id="page-453"></span> there was much of that. Albert’s family also would be in Manti to welcome her. And when she neared the end of her journey and looked out of the window of the Rio Grande train on which she traveled, and saw the majestic Manti Temple on the hill overlooking snow covered Sanpete Valley, her heart must have welled up and almost cried out loud, “Home Sweet Home”. She had been away so long - she was lonesome for the patient, faithful, ever-loving Laurs!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert’s family was mostly at home, although Virginia was married to Daniel M. Keeler and living in Provo, where she was expecting her first baby in the spring. Elaine was teaching in the High School at Manti. Albert and Jennie’s three boys were at home and he and Myrtle now had two little ones of their own, the boy Cullen, two and a half years old, and the baby girl, Mable Norma, six and a half months. Else visited with them a little while on her way from the station. She felt better acquainted with Myrtle now than at first. She confided in her the fact that she had had “an axe to grind” for several years and that she had taken care of that on this journey. Then she told her about that Danish friend of hers, sister so-and-so, who had remarked to her some years before Vena had married, “Ja, but Vena you vill haf alvays vit you”. “I vent to visit this friend on the way home from my trip”, said Else with a triumphant smile in her eyes, “and ven she asked about my children, and Vena in particular and if she vas vell, I said to her, ‘Ja, ja - and Vena now has four beautiful datters!’” Yes indeed, Else K. was in excellent spirits when she returned from her trip.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was election day the day Else came back and she went to the polls and cast her vote, and this turned out to be the final public act of her earthly career. Within a week she had contracted a cold which gradually went down into her lungs and turned to pneumonia. She was seriously ill for only three days. Her children were notified and those near at hand came to do what they could. The wife of the tailor next door, Sister Petersen, who was a nurse as well as a very close friend <span id="page-454"></span> and neighbor, offered her services, and, working under the direction of the doctor who was summoned, did everything she possibly could for her desperately ill friend.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Else K. Christensen passed away Monday night, 19th Nov. 1923. It was a shock to all who knew her. Sister Petersen laid her out, with the kind assistance of other sisters of mercy. One of their last services at the time was to wash Else’s long, heavy head of gray auburn-streaked hair, and partially dry it and then leave it hanging down from her head at the end of the table where she was laid, to complete the drying before she could be dressed in her burial clothes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have heard it said that sometimes spirits hover around their dead bodies until they are finally laid in mother earth to rest, to make sure all goes well. Indeed stranger things have been told. A couple of nights after Else’s body had been laid out there in her home in Manti she appeared to Sister Petersen in a dream or visitation. She said nothing but seemed to be disturbed and kept rubbing the back of her neck. Sister Petersen felt strange and puzzled about it and the next morning went next door to the Christensen’s to look at the body. Of course she lifted the long hair hanging almost to the floor and looked at the neck of the corpse. She found that someone had left a damp towel rolled between the hair and the neck, keeping things from drying out there. Decomposition was beginning to set in and this had to be taken care of right away. Some may find this hard to believe but it was told to members of the family by Sister Petersen herself.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Manti Messenger carried an account of Grandmother’s death under the heading of “Else K. Christensen”, as follows:— “Passing quietly away at her home last Sunday night (Monday) Mrs. Else Cathrine Christensen ended peacefully a 76 year career of active service. ‘Do good to those in need’ seems to have been her guiding motto, for a careful study of her history shows her activities to have been directed along these lines. From her earliest childhood she has been devoted to service.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“She was born in Thisted (county) Denmark, <span id="page-455"></span> Feb. 9, 1847, the daughter of Andrew (Anders) Christian and Mette Christine (Kirstine) White (Hvid) Christensen. Early in 1865 she was baptized into the Church and on April 22nd of the following year married L. M. C. Christensen. The following month the couple left for America, she leaving her home and family for the sake of the Gospel. They arrived in Manti in October of that year, having endured the hardships of the sailing vessel on the ocean and the ox teams across the plains. They moved to Gunnison from Manti and then became associated with the United Order at Mayfield, later moving back to Gunnison where they spent many years. Later they moved to Manti, then to Salt Lake briefly (?) then back to Manti, which has been their home since. They reared nine children to maturity and two foster children; they have 54 living grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mrs. Christensen has been a devoted mother to her family, wife to her husband, and ever ready to give service to her church and to those in need. She was the first doctor nurse Gunnison Valley had. She served in the Relief Society both as an officer and teacher and in the Primary Association. She was chosen at one time as a delegate to represent the Republicans of this county in a State convention in Salt Lake. She has been especially devoted to the gathering of her genealogy and has a record back to the fifteenth century. She has made two trips back to her native land, once alone and once with her husband, to gather genealogy and has devoted years of service in the temple to work for her dead relatives and friends. She is survived by her husband and the following children: Andrew B., Salt Lake; Joseph C., Arthur M. and Mrs. Emma E. Peterson, Gunnison; Albert H., Manti; Mrs. Elsie K. Bartholomew and Mrs. Elvena Clark, Goshen; Louis D., Evanston, Wyoming; and Mrs. Tresia Lacy, adopted daughter, Exeter, California.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The account of her funeral in the Manti Messenger was as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Impressive Services for Mrs. Christensen” <span id="page-456"></span> “A large group of mourners gathered at the tabernacle last Friday to pay respects to Mrs. L. M. C. Christensen. The services were conducted by Bishop’s Counselor Alphonso Henrie. The choir sang ‘Come, Come Ye Saints’. Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Johnson sang a duet. Miss Christy Parry sang a solo, and Miss Helen Fikstad and the choir sang ‘Come Ye Disconsolate’. The speakers were Simon Christensen, Peter Sorensen of Ephraim, N. R. Peterson, Pres. A. E. Park of Gunnison, and Temple Pres. L. R. Anderson.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The account of Grandmother’s death, life and burial as taken from the Gunnison Gazette at the time is also recorded here:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Pioneer Woman is Called to Reward</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Else K. Christensen, beloved wife of L. M. C. Christensen, and well known throughout Gunnison Valley and the entire county, passed to the great beyond at her home in Manti last Monday night at 12 o’clock. Death followed a three-day serious illness and notwithstanding the fact that she was very ill she was conscious and realized that the end was near and bade all those about her farewell. The husband, and Joseph and Albert, sons, and a daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Peterson, were at the bedside when the end came.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mrs. Christensen just recently returned from an extended visit to some of her children in the northern part of the state and in Wyoming, where she spent six weeks, and on her return was well and in splendid spirits.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The deceased was born in Denmark, Feb. 9, 1847, and had she lived until this coming February would have been 77 years old. When eighteen years old she joined the L. D. S. Church and later emigrated to America, settling first in Manti. After a residence there for awhile she removed to Gunnison and resided here for more than thirty years. Some few years ago she returned to Manti where she lived until called to the other world. Mrs. Christensen was widely known and loved always. In the early days she was the only trained nurse in the entire valley, and through her charming <span id="page-457"></span> and loving ways and her efficiency in administering to the sick, she was highly esteemed and loved by all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In her religious belief she was devout. For thirty years she was an ardent worker in the Relief Society and did much charity work. She was also regarded as a very brilliant woman and before coming to America, taught in the schools of her native land. Since her residence at Manti she has devoted her time to temple work, and her time was occupied in this both at Manti and in Salt Lake. Besides her husband and children she leaves two sisters and a brother in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Funeral services have been arranged for tomorrow, Friday, at one o’clock. Services will be held at Manti and the body will be laid in its final resting place in the Manti Cemetery.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, Grandmother Else K. Christensen was laid to rest 23 Nov. 1923, in the Manti City Cemetery, almost within the shade of the magnificent Manti Temple which stands on the crest of the once “Gray Hill”, overlooking the valley, and in which she had labored ardently and long for so many years for the salvation of others. Her grave was placed on Albert’s cemetery plot close to that of his first lovely wife, Jennie. Some quite elaborate funeral cards, similar to ones often used in Old Denmark on such occasions, were printed with Else K.‘s name on and sent to her close relatives in Denmark as a last farewell and keepsake from her to them. (Cousin LaFaun has one of these in her possession.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Only a simple flat stone marker designates the place of Else’s resting. No fancy monument marks the spot. Like the other noble mother there beside her, her real monument is to be found in the lives of her children and her children’s children, even to the fifth generation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MONUMENT</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">“I asked her once, when I was young, <br class="calibre4"/> ‘Dear mother, are you great? <br class="calibre4"/> And will there someday be a stone <br class="calibre4"/> That will commemorate <br class="calibre4"/> <span id="page-458"></span> The things you’ve done to help the world?’<br class="calibre4"/> My mother smiled at me, <br class="calibre4"/> ‘You are my monument’ she said, <br class="calibre4"/> ‘And all the world will see <br class="calibre4"/> In your kind deeds and in your life <br class="calibre4"/> The ideals of your mother, <br class="calibre4"/> You are my monument’ said she. <br class="calibre4"/> ‘I would not want another.’ <br class="calibre4"/> So now I must stand straight and tall <br class="calibre4"/> And now I must be true <br class="calibre4"/> To all the dreams you had for me - <br class="calibre4"/> This monument to you.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are some people who, from the moment you become conscious of them, you care about. Suddenly they have something to do with your life. If they succeed - you succeed; if they have a failure - you fail to some degree. They wrap themselves around your mind and heart. To me, Grandmother Else K. was such a one! Softly she calls to me over the years - even today. Tenuously her memory clings. To be true to myself I have had to write of her the things that I know and feel. One thing I feel deeply is that in this earthly existence she gained the approbation of an all wise and loving Heavenly Father for her sacrifice and her faithfulness, obedience and devotion to her Maker, and for her great service to and her love and compassion for his children - both the living and the dead. She was a great soul. Sometimes I imagine I can almost hear an echo of words coming from beyond the veil - “Well and beautifully done, Else K.!”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandfather Laurs went on with his life and his temple work - one couldn’t just stop in the middle of things. Just weeks following Else’s death he did the work for his brother Christen. He was more contented in the temple than most any place then. His children who were living near, Emma, Joseph, Arthur, Albert and their companions were very considerate of him, as were those who lived farther away. He often spent time with them but he preferred to live mainly in his own</p>

    <p>Laurs</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-459"></span> home and try and go on as before. But he was lonely - there was no doubt about that! Being naturally a rather quiet man himself, he missed Else’s humming at her work, the exuberance of her conversation - her small talk - her soul talk; and oh how he missed the comfort and strength of her presence. Afterall, they had enjoyed more than fifty-six and a half years together as man and wife - mostly happy years in spite of hardships; one didn’t put aside a thing like that without longing. But Laurs needed a companion - and he needed a housekeeper.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One day in the Manti Temple he happened to mention the latter to a widow whom he often met and visited with there. In fact the two seemed to be somewhat attracted to each other. Though Laurs was half way joking about it at the time, Sister Nielsen took him up on it right away and practically popped the question herself (or so her only daughter, Helga N. Larsen of Springville seems to think it happened). Well why not?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So Laurs M. C. Christensen, widower of seventy-seven years, and Sorena Boleta Thyrring Nielsen, widow of nearly sixty-seven, went to the County Court House at Manti and got a marriage license and the same day, 21 Nov. 1924 went into the Manti Temple and were married, for time only; for Sorena was already sealed to her first husband for eternity. Laurs shaved off the moustache he had worn for many years and the new bride and groom had their pictures taken together.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sorena made Laurs a good housekeeper and a splendid companion. She was of a very cheerful nature and at times even a regular “cut-up”. They got along wonderfully together. She was extremely attentive and good to him. She belonged to the Scandinavian Choir there in Manti and was also often featured on Danish programs as a singer and entertainer. Laurs was proud of her. She, like Laurs, loved to dance. Byron tells of going to grandpa’s house there on Union Street one day after they were married, but it appeared that no one was at home. Yet the house was unlocked and he sensed that someone was there. He found grandpa and Sorena in the basement dancing - they <span id="page-460"></span> were having a fine time. Sorena’s son and daughter, by her first marriage, were pleased with Laurs and they got along well together whenever they had the opportunity to meet. Laurs and Else’s children welcomed Sorena with open arms, - “It is the best thing that could have happened to father now”, they said. She responded with love and treated them all as her own. The grandchildren too were showered with her attention, as evidenced by two beautiful “star” quilt tops she pieced and sent to me as a token of affection.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sorena, like Laurs, had been born in Denmark and also came to Zion for the Gospel’s sake. She and a brother came over together, leaving parents, family and friends. Much of her research remained to be done, as well as her temple work, and Laurs was able to help her a great deal with these. She helped him with his also - and with Else’s. When he had word from Denmark of Else’s sister Marie’s death, 7 Mar. 1925, and again of Else’s sister Karen’s passing exactly a year and eight days later, 15 Mar. 1926, Sorena went to the temple and did the work for them when their time was right.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But time passes and people get old. The one who never grows old, “Peter Pan”, lives only in “Never-Never Land”. The long hard school of life began to close in on Laurs. He became ill of a diabetic condition which settled in his toes and gradually spread. He suffered a great deal for many months. Excerpts from his son Albert’s recollections printed in “The Hard Rich Soil”, in the form of letters mostly written to his son Sherman, tell much of his father’s suffering in his last days, as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“16 July 1928. Grandfather Christensen is quite ill. I’m afraid he won’t be here long. He would like to live he says, but if his time has come he is ready to go… 4 Aug. 1928. Grandfather Christensen is very ill and I don’t know how much longer the life forces can sustain him. He is a wonderfully fine type of man. You may well be proud of your grandfathers… 18 Aug. 1928. Grandfather is still doing very poorly and he is quite discouraged. Grandmother Christensen is very fine to him and we all appreciate her. She is <span id="page-461"></span> entitled to a great deal of credit. She never spares herself but waits on him constantly… 18 Sept. 1928. Grandfather is still doing very poorly. He cannot move about and the days and nights seem so long. He is in pain constantly. He prays continuously to be released. He would like to pass away as he feels no hope of recovery… 24 Sept. 1928. Grandfather is still lingering on without getting much better, if any at all. He is getting entirely discouraged. It is too bad, the grand man that he is and has been, that his last days should be so full of pain and suffering… 15 Oct. 1928. Grandfather is still very bad, in fact getting worse all the time, and he would like to be relieved from his misery. He cannot get well it seems and the sooner he can pass the better, as he feels. Of course we are doing all possible for him. Aunt Myrtle went down the latter part of last week and she came back yesterday. She says grandfather is very bad and wants to die. He may, however, linger for a month or more… 6 Nov. 1928. I stayed at Grandfather’s Sunday night and yesterday until train time. He is in very bad condition, poor dear; he is also having a very hard time and no chance to get well. Under the conditions it would be a blessing if he could get relief. His mind is as keen as lightning but his body is racked with pain. Uncle Andrew went down to see him this evening and I phoned Louis at Lyman, Wyoming this morning that father wanted him to come down. He promised that he would.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of course all of his children wanted to be near him to give him the aid and comfort that they could. Most of them came often. Even his foster daughter, Tresia, and her husband Jim Lacy, came to see him before he passed away. Tresia tells about how they had written her that Grandfather felt that if he could only get hold of some whisky that this might bring about a cure. It had been used to cure so many things in the early days when Grandmother was practicing medicine. But Utah had prohibition at that time and no whisky could be had there. So they brought him some whisky smuggled in from Montana. Grandfather was so pleased at their visit and pleased for their gift - and they bathed his sore-ridden foot and leg in <span id="page-462"></span> that, but of course to no avail. The diabetic ulcers were in their last stages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert and his family were of course then living in Orem, Utah. We continue with extracts from his letters to his son Sherman: “12 Nov. 1928. Grandfather Christensen passed away day before yesterday about 1:30 o’clock P. M. and I am here in Manti to assist in performing for him the last earthly service we can. The funeral will be held in the Center Ward Tabernacle here tomorrow at 2 o’clock P.M. He will be laid away on the south side of Grandmother - where he has designated. He remained conscious until the very last. It was a marvel to all how rapid and accurate his mental facilities worked throughout his great pain and suffering. Although unassuming, his mind was of a very fine order and capable of an accurate grasp of matters of general as well as particular concern… 14 Nov. 1928. Grandfather was given a fine funeral. Many of his old friends and friends of the family attended the services. The speaking, singing and other music were excellent. All of his living children were there except Louis from Lyman, who could not come. Also many of his grandchildren and some great-grandchildren were there. Phillip was with me. (Aunt Myrtle and the small children could not attend, being under quarantine still.) Ted and Elaine were also at the funeral but Dan and Virginia couldn’t come.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In her history Laurs and Else’s oldest daughter, Elsie Bartholomew, wrote this account:— “Death brought relief to Father on 10 Nov. 1928, nearly five years after mother’s passing. He was 81 years 3 months and 19 days old when he died. Funeral services were held in the Tabernacle or Center Ward Chapel Tuesday afternoon 13 Nov. 1928. Many mourners from Manti, Gunnison Valley and Mayfield attended. Speakers were Simon Christensen, Bishop Brigham Jenson of Centerfield, Bishop Niels R. Peterson of Manti, and Patriarch J. Hatten Carpenter of Manti, with closing remarks by Bishop Stott of the Manti Center Ward, who presided. Three numbers were sung by the choir - ‘There is Sweet Rest in Heaven’, ‘Rock of Ages’ and ‘I Need Thee Every Hour’. A <span id="page-463"></span> violin solo ‘Oh My Father’ was rendered by Chauncy L. Whitbeck; a vocal solo, ‘The End of a Perfect Day’ by Mrs. Mildred Jensen, and a vocal duet, ‘The Morning’, by Mr. and Mrs. Ellis E. Johnson. President Jacobsen offered the invocation and the benediction was by S. Peter Peterson. He was buried beside mother in the Manti Cemetery.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandfather’s second wife, Sorena, continued to live on in the home in Manti, which she inherited, for well onto ten years longer. Then she moved to Springville and made her home with her daughter Helga until she passed away. The following account of her appeared in the Provo Herald Sun. 28 Mar. 1943, under the caption, “Sorena Christenson”: “Springville - Funeral services will be conducted in the Fourth Ward Chapel this Sunday at 3 P.M. for Mrs. Sorena T. Nielsen Christensen, 85, who died Thursday night at the home of a daughter, Mrs. Helga N. Larsen, with whom she had made her home the past four years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Graveside services will be conducted at Ferron, Utah at 1 P.M. Monday and burial will be at Ferron, under the direction of A. Y. Wheeler and Son Mortuary. Friends may call at the Larsen residence, 140 East Third North in Springville before the services Sunday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mrs. Christensen was born in Denmark Feb. 1, 1858, a daughter of Marton and Nikolana Hansen Thyrring. At an early age she and a brother came to Utah as converts to the L. D. S. Church. She lived at Ephraim for a number of years and later moved to Salina. She has been an ardent church worker, having been a Relief Society teacher 45 years, and has also worked in the temple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Besides Mrs. Larsen she has a son, Christian T. Nielsen of Ferron; also nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren; a stepson, Nick L. Nielsen of Homedale, Idaho, and two sisters, Mrs. Eliza Nielsen and Mrs, Ella S. Smith of California.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs of course outlived all the members of the Christensen Company who came to Zion together in 1866, besides his brother Christen <span id="page-464"></span> and all of Else’s people back in Denmark, except perhaps her brother Mads Hvid, of whose death we have no account.<sup id="fnref:14" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:14">14</a></sup> He also outlived all of Christen and Anne’s children, with the exception of Caroline and “Chris Krat”. Dear patient, sincere, devout and honest Grandfather Laurs. Like his father, his word was as good as his bond. His principles were the highest and his ideals most noble. He was humble - yet dignified; full of good humor - yet sensitive and sympathetic to the greatest degree. He was a gentleman, a loving husband and father, and he was a loved and respected grandfather. We shall always cherish his memory.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here ends the story of Laurs and Else K. Christensen as far as this book goes. We who have followed them were born into a world quite different from the one in which they lived and wove their patterns of life. With their faith and works they helped to build this new world for us and future generations. It is a greater world, a more exciting world than they were given. It is only yesterday that our pioneer grandparents walked the earth and did the work they chose to do. And simply by doing well the things they did, with their vision cast afar, they helped to provide for us and ours greater opportunities than they themselves had ever dreamed of. There have been more changes since they passed away than in all other times of written history put together. Could they have visioned, when they sailed the seas in 1866 and walked across the plains to “Zion Land”, jet liners traversing the skies from here to Denmark in a matter of hours? From sagebrush to cement and steel, from covered wagon to mooncraft, from Pony Express to Telstar - these are but a few of the changes that have taken place since yesteryear.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Truly, we ourselves may claim no honor, no reward, no respect, special position, recognition or credit because of what our grandparents were or what they wrought. We can only set eternal goals and try to emulate the greatness of their characters and their devotion to service, and in so doing bring lasting honor to their names. How <span id="page-465"></span> we conduct ourselves is vastly important, for we hold the future of the world in our hands. What we do today, history will record tomorrow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet each of us has so little time, as the eternities of time are accounted. The wise wiil charish it - the foolish waste it. For though it is free, time is a relentless tyrant and takes its toll in the long run. There is no time for shoddy work - no time for non-essentials. The hourglass of each life runs out too quickly.</p>
