  <h2 id="kobber-1865-1866" class="calibre9">KOBBERØ … 1865-1866</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The old coachman had no more wit than heaven was pleased to grant him, which was little, Else thought, as he immediately started a harangue about things he had got wind of in the town. Some of it concerned her, though he knew it not, and Else’s face reddened at what was being said of her <span id="page-128"></span> there. “If I were this … wayward girl’s parents I’d … plenty soon kick her out in the street and shut the … door in her face, snow or no!” He dismissed that subject thus, though his exact words were more highly embellished. Else thought disgustedly, “My parents did not kick me out nor shut the door in my face!” Then she recalled Mor’s shut door—but passed it off. She had left voluntarily to save them added embarrassment and grief - but she would return under happier circumstances someday, she hoped. She still longed for a miracle for her family. “How far to Kobberø?” she asked along the way. “About 28 kilometers [some 17 miles], but shorter as the bird flies,” the coachman answered.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else was relieved when they stopped at Stagstrup and picked up another passenger; it gave the coachman other ears to talk into. She had dreaded so many miles of loose chatter in her direction. They were traveling slowly too, for it was poor road, snow and ice mixed with mud, and many deep ruts to pull through. The two Danishmen smoked and exchanged gossip and coarse jokes, punctuated with guffaws—some about “Mormons”. This conversation Else ignored as best she could. She was not priggish, but there was a manner of unmistakable dignity about her which, after a time, made the others unconsciously shut their mouths on the vulgar words and begin talking of more respectable, though to them humdrum, affairs. Righteousness is a shield against many things! Meanwhile, Else pulled her wrappings up closer about her and pretended to be dozing as she busied herself with her own musings. She could have wept from homesickness then and there had she been alone, strange as it was. Courage was something she was growing into slowly. She had never traveled this far away, though she had longed to without seriously thinking. It was just that this particular going-away seemed to have such a finality about it somehow, for it was surely not very far as distances went. When next would she be going back to her parents’ cottage, she wondered, and what lay ahead of her now? What would she find of happiness or sorrow in Kobberø? It is easier to look back on things, for then one sees <span id="page-129"></span> the beginning and the end at almost one and the same minute.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Time was drawing well on into the late afternoon when they pulled up at the coach barn in Visby, about half way, to change teams. It was bitter cold! Else ate her lunch then, and recalled an old Scandinavian proverb which went something like this:— “When the days begin to lengthen, the weather begins to strengthen.” So too does the Jutland wind, she thought; for they were now close to the Limfjord and the wind was stiff and still rising. The time of travel had seemed long but she contented herself with the knowledge that all things must draw to a close, both good and bad. They continued on from Visby for another hour or so, following the main thoroughfare going south, then turned west at Ydby and followed a lesser highway some distance to the town of Gettrup. Here the other passenger alighted, and he seemed to take much of the little warmth that had been in the coach with him. Else was thoroughly chilled and dark was gathering. They drove past a white Parish church and on west from the town a spell, then turned onto a farm road swinging southwest towards the water again. She could see nothing outside now, except where the coach lights cast their gleam, but it was only two more miles before they began passing straggling farm houses, with lanterns hung out and dogs barking warnings against their coming. They were approaching Kobberø, the driver said, and Else straightened her shawl and bonnet and began getting her baggage in order, Then the long winter’s ride ended for her as the coachman pulled up right at the Christensen’s very door and dropped her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Helped in hurridly out of the wind and cold, midst most friendly greetings. Else was escourted to a comfortable sitting room and soon seated by a big open fire, which would have warmed her thoroughly had not the cheery welcome of the delightful family done it first. Here it seemed then to her was the best she had ever had in all her dreaming of it. As introductions were made she marked the name of each, as well as the appearance and manner. A well-bred, tidy and <span id="page-130"></span> comely family they were withal. Christen Christensen, the “husmand”, an upstanding Dane of some forty-eight years, was rather tall and somewhat stern looking, but she took to him right away nevertheless. His frail wife, Karen, younger than he by more than nine years, was dark haired and attractive, and to Else seemed as loving, gentle and gracious a mistress as one could ever wish for. The two sons, Christen and Laurs, looked about her very age, but when she inquired of it she found she was in between them. Christen, the taller and heavier one, would soon be nineteen while Laurs, a bit shorter but with curly hair and far more handsome, was but seven months past seventeen. Maren, the eldest daughter, had barely turned sixteen, She was small of stature and very pretty, but seemed to take herself somewhat seriously. Pouline, almost ten, was the plainest of the four girls and she was shy and prim. Petrine, called “Trina”, who would have her sixth birthday in less than two weeks, was the daintiest, most loving and adorable little miss Else had ever seen, and seemed like the gentle Karen in so many ways. Sena, just past two-and-a-half years, clung to her mother and hid her face till it was hard to judge her. Then there were the two servants who seemed pleasant enough—a lady cook and a housemaid, with whom Else was to share quarters. When Mr. Christensen asked her about herself and she told him somewhat of how she had been forced to seek employment, they all seemed to wonder, and his wife clucked her tongue and said, “O Ja, —think you any of us would have done it?” Then the son Laurs spoke up, “Nej, —this was no small thing it seems to me,” and they all nodded — all except young Christen. Ja, she was among friends!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Theirs was a rambling farmhouse and there was plenty room for much happiness there. It had been intended for many children, but the gentle Karen had suffered the mishaps of losing four little ones, three of them one after another from the cradle as it were. Had all lived there would have been ten children living in the home now, all of them having been born there in Kobberø in the Parish of Gettrup, There were Christen, born <span id="page-131"></span> 24 April 1846 (named for his father); Lauritz Mathias Christian, called Laurs, born 22 July 1847 (just two days before the first band of Mormon Pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley) and who was named for his mother’s father, Lauritz Jeppesen. Maren (later called Mary) born 14 Feb. 1849; Ane Marie (named after two of her father’s sisters) who was born 2 March 1850 and died in August the same year at five months; Peder Christen, born 5 July 1851 and died at three years eight months, 9 Mar. 1855 (named for his father’s brother who died young); Niels Christian, born 25 Apr. 1853, who died right away; Pouline (anglicized to Pauline) born 20 Mar. 1855, just eleven days after her little brother Peder died (named for her mother’s maternal grandmother, Pouline Kasgard); the first Petrine, born 4 May 1857 and died 13 Mar. 1858, when ten months nine days old (named also in memory of little dead Peder); the second Petrine, called “Trina” (named for the first, as was a Scandinavian custom) born 28 Feb. 1859, just a year lacking two weeks from the day the first one died; and the last child, born 15 June 1862, called “Sena” but whose full name was Nielsine Christiana (in remembrance of her brother Niels Christian who died soon after birth).</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen Christensen himself had been born 29 July 1817 in the small scattered farm village of Flarup, known earlier as Flarupgaard (“gaard” meaning farm in Danish). It is situated a few miles east of the town of Gettrup, midway between there and the larger town of Ydby, just over the line into Ydby Parish. His father had been born in the same village, as had his father’s father and mother also; in fact, all of his progenitors, at least back to the year 1592, both male and female, had been born within a radius of not more than ten miles from Flarup (Ydby, Dover, Gettrup, Helligsø, Kobberø, etc.), or in Flarupgaard itself. Christen felt pretty certain, however, that all of his forerunners had lived in that selfsame area since before the time of the Vikings, even from the beginning of habitation there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The aforementioned small villages and towns <span id="page-132"></span> are all nestled in the southern part of that region often referred to as Thyland, or “Thy”, the lower half and most western part of far North Jutland, which is cut off from the rest of it by the beautiful Limfjord, that unexpectedly meandering, lengthy fjord which runs diagonally across the peninsula east and west, from the Kattegat to the North Sea. Carved out during the Ice Age, when the receding glaciers formed the landscapes, this largest of Denmark’s numerous fjords which enhances the graceful smiling and more fertile part of Thy, is so studded with inlets, coves, bays and sister fjords, into which its blue water enters, as to be almost unbelievable! The fjord itself is framed in picturesque bluffs and flats, although the scenery around it is varied, and its shores harbor many cozy smaller towns, as well as Thisted, the largest of those in Thy, also the large city of Aalborg, some distance northeast of this region. The waters of the Limfjord also surround Mors, a good-sized green island of scenic beauty which contains some of the loveliest scenery in Denmark; containing also many pleasant towns and villages, particularly the ancient historical city of Nykøbing and the town of Feggeklit, the place where Prince Hamlet, the Danish legend says, killed his uncle King Fegge, in revenge for the murder of his father, Horvendil.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thy is mostly a flat region of wide horizons and great contrasts. Very near Flarup and west of Hurup is the highest point in the entire region, 300 ft. above sea level, offering a beautiful view of the area. Giant chalk formations are found in some areas, especially in the most northwestern part at Hanstholm, where is also one of the strongest lighthouses in the world, overlooking the North Sea, and built during Christen’s time in 1842. Some of the slopes along the Limfjord are rich with moler, a clay found hardly anywhere else in the world. It is best seen south of Thisted, where many layers of volcanic ashes are visible in the clay. From this clay, light, porous bricks for insulation are made and exported to many countries. To the west and north, Thy is bordered by the cruel North Sea, which has been eating away at the land for centuries, carving out and swallowing well-off farms and even whole villages, or covering <span id="page-133"></span> them over with sand. In their places now is either the ever-hungry sea or stretches of dunes and moors whe re nothing good grows, and populated only by birds and a few animals, Sand drifts have covered much of the once fertile area northwest from Kobberø. And still farther north and west from there, near the town of Agger, entire villages have disappeared over the last three centuries. Agger Church was demolished and a new one raised more north in 1838, and soon after that the first breakwaters were built there to control the North Sea, both in Christen’s time. (Recently, large dikes have been constructed for the same purpose.) On the east and south of Thy is the so-different Limfjord and its bays. On its safe shores, Danes have been settled from way back, including the Viking Age, as witnessed by thousand-year old, boat-shaped burial places which cover large areas, and excavations from whence Vikings set forth on their raids across the North Sea. Here just a few miles east, as well as south from the village of Flarup, in the peaceful bays of this lovely fjord, the fleets of those fierce sailing warriors had gathered for their expeditions to England, France and the Mediterranean, a thousand years before.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But long before that there were people in this area. One or two thousand years before the birth of Christ, during the so-called Stone Age, and the later Bronze Age, this was a comparatively well populated part of the country. There is a Bronze Age graveyard at Ydby Moor, very close to Flarup, with more than 50 mounds. In fact, several thousand of these mounds are scattered all over Thy, and in its museums are relics, original or in copy, of finds telling of those bygone cultures, such as the famous Gold Boats from Nors and the amber axes at Thisted museum. At Lundehøj, about ten or so miles east of Flarup, is one of the most impressive megalithic tombs in the whole country, purported to be about 5,000 years old, and at Hørdum Church, a few miles southeast from Nørhaa, is kept the only known stone hewn to the Nordic war-god, Thor. It depicts his fight with the legendary Midgaard Serpent. Very near Kobberø, northwest, is Vestervig Church, once a cathedral. It was <span id="page-134"></span> erected around 1100 A.D., as a part of a big Augustine monastery. North of the church is Liden (Little) Kirstin’s grave. According to legend, Prince Buris (Henrikssøn) and Liden Kirstin, the half sister of King Valdemar I, were buried here after a tragic end to their love affair.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes indeed, Thy was a region where the past was speaking and Christen Christensen of Flarup believed his progenitors had been there when the ancient history of the area was made. Surely they must have gathered on the bays of the Limfjord and struck out to sea in long-ships with the early Vikings. Most likely they fought under King Harold Bluetooth or Sweyn Forkbeard, Perhaps some watched on the blood-drenched battlefield of Lyndanisse in Estonia, 15 June 1219, when the Danes’ first flag “Dannebrog” supposedly floated down from heaven, blood red with cross of white. Certainly some of his forefathers had been involved when, in 1340, the peasants of North Jutland rebelled, and the powerful baldheaded Count Gert marched up from Holstein with an army of 11,000 to quell them but was slain by a Jutlandic squire, thus saving the Danes from the German rule they so much dreaded. And when the North Jutland peasants rebelled again in 1535, at the crowning of King Christen III, some of his great-great-grandfathers must have joined them and stood up bravely to fight for what they believed to be right, and must have suffered also when the new King’s army slaughtered most of the citizens in Aalborg, as well as over 2,000 Jutland peasants who had rallied to make a last stand there. Jutland peasants clung and died together, for there had always been great fellowship among them through the ages. There was little doubt in his mind either but that various of his ancestors, over a period of almost a thousand years, had fought nobly time and time again, when calls came, in war after war to save Jutland’s neck, Slesvig, from the covetous Germans. (Christen’s own son, young Christen, had gone to battle in the recent war for this selfsame reason — ‘twas a pity the Danes lost that one!) Comparatively few in numbers, and never rich, the Danish have waged, with desperate bravery, wars far beyond their strength, Though they have <span id="page-135"></span> often lost, yet they have given stronger nations the impression that it was best to leave them alone. Yes, Christen the elder was mighty proud of his forebearers, those stalwart peasant Danes from Thy. He was grateful too for the part they had played in building and preserving the kingdom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It would have been easy to have failed in the era and circumstances into which Christen found himself plunged at birth, which was just three years following the close of Napoleon’s great rampage in Europe, that left so many of the countries there upset. The Danish Kingdom herself had been thrown into a state of discouragement. She was bankrupt and had lost the control of Norway besides; but above all she had lost her great Dano-Norwegian merchant fleet, second largest in the world, next to England’s. In fact, the country was then regarded as being utterly impoverished and on the verge of disintegration. It was in this austere national atmosphere of disappointment and soberness then that he grew up. Reconstruction proceeded but slowly at first, general conditions were extremely poor and throughout the land things seemed to be at a standstill.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Absolute Monarch, Frederick II, was ruling in Denmark at this time. He had likely made many wrong decisions, for he was not genius enough to be able to keep on top of things during that Napoleonic whirlwind, but his integrity was beyond question and besides he was dearly beloved, particularly by the peasants of his kingdom, for the reforms he had brought about in the earlier years of his reign in their behalf. At the age of 15, each Danishman became liable for military service and could be called to serve in the King’s army or navy anytime between ages 15 and 39. If there was war in Denmark no physically able male in this age bracket got out of it, unless perhaps he could hire someone to fight for him. In peacetime one might “draw a pass” when there was no great demand for soldiers. The law still remained that all males be placed on the military levying rolls at birth (at least until 1850), but Frederick VI did away with the “bound-to-the-soil” law and from that time forth peasants could live anywhere they <span id="page-136"></span> liked. At the same time it was decreed by him that peasants could once again buy and own their own farms and land. (This was a great step forward, for they had been deprived of this freeman privilege of owning property since the days of King Christian III, having been forced since that time to either rent their lands and pay manorial dues in money, crops and labor to the nobles, church or state, or labor entirely on the large estates of these great landowners.) Agriculture was given a lift in the country through the introduction of improved methods of cultivation, new farm implements and better ploughs.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen Christensen, the father of the family, had good reasons to be proud in his own right, aside from the accomplishments of his ancestors; for he himself was no ordinary fellow. He had been brought up in the era “after Napoleon” in a Danish household of modest demands and thriftiness. Likely he attended school at the parish town of Ydby in winters, from age eight to twelve inclusive, walking to and fro for that purpose in all sorts of weather. In summers he must have helped on the farm his father had been able to take over from his father. When he was two months short of his fifteenth birthday and the “age of fighting”, so to speak, his father, also named Christen Christensen, had passed away nine days following his forty-third birthday (1832) and, being the eldest child, Christen had taken over the family farm, as well as the support of his mother Maren and the younger children:— Karen, age eleven; Jens Christian, eight and a half; Marie, age six; and Anne, just past three years four months. Anne’s twin, Maren, had died soon after birth, January 1829, and the boy Peder at age eleven, 1830, there having been seven children in the family in all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is doubtful if Christen himself was called into military service, either in his teens or twenties, the country being at peace during those years and the king being anxious to build up Danish farms and agriculture again. He must have grieved with other Danish peasants when old Frederick VI died, in 1839, and been somewhat dubious as well <span id="page-137"></span> when the old king’s cousin became King Christian VIII, for he was middle-aged and had little foresight. Christen apparently hadn’t thought much about marriage, or at least hadn’t done anything about it, until sometime after his twenty-seventh birthday. But then he courted and won the hand of the lovely Karen Lauritzen, youngest daughter of the widow Marianne Jeppesen of the town of Gettrup nearby. On 25 March 1845, when he lacked four months of being twenty-eight and Karen was eighteen and a half, the two were married in the Parish Church at Gettrup, soon after their engagement intentions had been duly advertised by the Pastor there. Christen must have sold or given up the family farm to his younger and only living brother, Jens Christian, then or soon after, for he took his bride to live in the village of Kobberø, some five miles from Flarup and half of that from Gettrup. Jens stayed on in Flarup and likely ran the family farm and kept a home for his mother and sisters, and subsequently married a widow lady there. Christen and Karen both had relatives in Kobberø and so he bought a farm there and settled. He had built that farm until it had become one of the richest and best in the whole area and he was considered one of the most successful farmers around. He employed a number of laborers, both on the farm and in the house. Aside from this he manufactured farm implements on his place, for which he had good market. He was a lover of thoroughbred horses and owned a number, as well as his own up-to-date and impressive carriage. He loved sports and was a fine wrestler and jumper, as well as being clever at horseshoes. He had numerous friends and relatives in South Thy, being well known and well respected withal. Yes, Christen Christensen was a well-to-do, successful, selfmade man, one might say, and besides had fathered ten children and provided well for his household.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The gentle Karen herself was a woman of high intelligence and refinement, with a deep spiritual nature. She had been born in Gettrup, 8 Sept. 1826, the youngest of the three children, all daughters, born to Lauritz Jeppesen <span id="page-138"></span> (anglicized to Laurs Jepsen) and Marianne Elizabeth Kristensen Eskov (anglicized to Mariane Christensen). (Eskov was the name of the place from whence her great-great paternal grandfather, Peder Sørensen, had originated, having been born there around 1678.) Her father’s progenitors had lived right there in the area of Gettrup for more than two centuries at least, for there was a record of them back to her fourth great-grandparents, Eric Nielsen and his wife Mette Jensen Nielsen, who were each born in Kobberøgaard about 1604 and 1610 respectively. So Karen too must have descended from the early Vikings of Thy and their predecessors there. But Karen’s mother’s forerunners had not come from Thy, as far back as they knew, but from across the Limfjord east and south, where its waters had pushed themselves in to form several smaller fjords and bays, including Skive Fjord. It was here on the shores of Skive Fjord in the large city of Skive that her mother had been born, the youngest of the four daughters, of Kristen Kristensen (Eschou) and Pouline Kasgaard. Kristen’s people were from Selde, some ten miles or so north from there but had originally come from the village of Eschou (Eskou or Eskuer) midway between Selde and Skive. Pouline Kasgaard may have been from Skive, in Skive Parish, but there is reason to believe she was from much farther south, in Viborg, since the first three of her four daughters had been born there, only the fourth, Karen’s mother Marianne, having been born in Skive. It was from the cathedral city of Viborg, that ancient cultural center in mid-Jutland, that Jutland’s royal army had ridden, from time immemorial, southward by horse and cart, to Denmark’s ancient border near Danevirke to fight off the Germans. (Where the modern highway has not replaced the old road, cart tracks dating back several centuries may still be traced in the heather and near the fjords.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 8 Dec. 1843, when Karen was just two months past her seventeenth birthday, her father died at age sixty-five years nine months, leaving her mother, herself and her two older sisters, Maren, just a week past twenty-one and Ane, nineteen and a half. In less than a year-and-a-half <span id="page-139"></span> after his death all three of the girls had married:— Maren, 20 Oct. 1844 to Niels Thomsen; Ane, 2 Mar. 1845 to Poul Jensen; and Karen, two and-a-half weeks after Ane, 25 Mar. 1845 to Christen Christensen of Flarup. All three couples were married in the Parish Church in Gettrup and, strange as it may seem, all took up their first residence in Kobberø, although Ane and her husband later moved to Hillerslev, nearby. The girls’ mother more than likely moved to Kobberø too and took turns living with her daughters, although she must have spent most of her time with her youngest, Karen, because she needed her the most. Maren only had one son, young Christen’s age, while Ane had two girls and two boys but lost the first girl soon after birth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Karen’s mother must have been with her when her first five babies were born, and also there to give aid and comfort when wee Ane Marie had died, the first child to leave the nest. Bedstemoder Marianne herself had been the next one to go, passing away just seven months after her tiny granddaughter, 25 Mar. 1852, which happened to be Karen’s and Christen’s seventh wedding anniversary. They had the church bell tolled for her, and the funeral and the “dirt casting”, and laid her beside her husband Lauritz in the churchyard at Gettrup where they had so recently placed little Ane Marie to rest. There were so many of their kindred at rest there in that Gettrup Parish churchyard, and more to come, It was Karen’s uncle, the widower Peder Jeppesen, a brother of her father, who had taken his place there next, having died just a month after Marianne. Then one by one, within the next few years, three more of Karen’s babies had been buried in that same burial ground. It wasn’t long before the newer graves had hedges growing all around, with flowers blooming inside in summers like all the others; mute evidence that love, birth and death, the tapestry of life, is little altered, in the main, no matter when or where its threads are woven. But death had seemed to strike so often there then. It was small comfort that the churchyards were sometimes far more beautiful than parks, with their white churches hovering <span id="page-140"></span> above the flower-grown graves, their bell towers always facing west toward the setting sun; for what hope did these churches and their priests offer the bereaved? “From dirt thou camest and to dirt thou returnest” were the words spoken by those who cast the “holy dirt” into the tombs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This Christensen family had always attended the Parish church at Gettrup, the gentle Karen having been very particular about church going, as her mother Marianne had been before her. The births and baptisms of each of her children had been duly acknowledged and registered by the Priest there, all except little Niels Christian who had died in his sins right away before there had been time to have him “døbt”<sup id="fnref:1" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This had been a cankering sorrow to the family ever since, but especially to the gentle Karen whose grief at the time had been pitiful indeed. They had done everything they could to make amends for this neglect. The little dead ones had all been buried in the churchyard there, as mentioned, and the three older ones, Christen, Laurs, and Maren, had each received their confirmations in the church there, in their turns, as had Karen and her sisters done in theirs. The family as a whole had been very faithful in the church attendance on “Holy Days” at Easters and Christmases and even regular services and masses. Christen himself had contributed consistently to the upkeep of the Parish, as well as the salary of the priest. Karen read and studied her Bible often and had become somewhat acquainted with the scriptures. The church congregations in Gettrup were usually made up mostly of the Christensens’ relatives and friends, but few were as religious as they, especially as Karen, for she herself was a most devout Lutheran.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The education of the Christensen children had not been neglected either. Christen, Laurs, and Maren had each attended the free church-sponsored school provided in their area, from ages eight through twelve as the law required. Their father, a selfmade man himself, had likely considered that enough formal education for them, believing more in the value of practical experience and honest toil as an educator. Although he often <span id="page-141"></span> employed farm hands and maidservants, especially in later years, yet he had insisted on the boys working on the farm and Maren in the house. Karen had sincerely tried to teach her children something of the great art of living she herself had learned so well:—courtesy, refinement, mastery of self and the means of life about them, enjoyment of simple things and appreciation for all that was good.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The daughter Pouline had also started school when she was eight but dropped out the forepart of her second year, at Yuletide. Now Danish officials were determined that there would be no illiteracy in the country, yet it was permissable for children to remain away from school if good enough reasons could be found. If a child were sickly, or needed by the parents in the home, or if the distance were too far to school or the weather too rough, one could remain at home during the school term provided arrangements could be made for him or her to be properly taught in the home. What excuse the Christensens gave for Pouline’s absence from the school is uncertain; perhaps it was the weather, or again it may have been the fact that there was already a governess employed in the home. However, the real crux of the matter was that they had removed their daughter from the State school to save her from possible embarrassment or harsh treatment there, since it had lately been rumored about the area that the Christensens were “Mormon lovers”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It had all started to happen when the gentle Karen, in her sweet way, had opened the door to two Mormon missionaries and let them in out of the cold. That they had been kinder to her than she to them that day she had scarcely realized, yet they had warmed her heart with the beauty of the Restored Gospel. Being much impressed with their words she had invited the Elders to return. Meantime she had taken to studying her Bible more in order to determine if the words they had spoken were true. She told Christen about their visit, insisting that what the Mormon missionaries had said agreed with the scriptures yet disagreed with what the priest had told his congregations. <span id="page-142"></span> Her husband had taken little stock in the affair to begin with, but made no objection to the Elders coming if she wished it, though he knew somewhat of the reputation of the Mormons. He was one to pamper his wife, and besides he trusted Karen’s judgment.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On their next visit the Elders brought with them the “new Bible” or Book of Mormon, and left it with her. She had started to read then and hardly put the book down for days until she had read it through. Her soul burned with a knowledge of the truth of it, as she poured over its pages, and she rejoiced. There was one section in the last of the book that astonished her perhaps more than any other and she re-read it carefully, over and over:— Moroni 8:11-21 “…little children need no repentance, neither baptism…” (She skipped some here and there.) “Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity… For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he has no baptism. Little children cannot repent… And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ… Woe unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me — listen — and give heed…” As Karen read these things she cried out with happiness, “Our little Niels — the priest was wrong - wrong!” And she knew it fully then.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It had taken only a few more visits and discussions with the Elders until Karen had known she was ready for baptism by immersion, as the Lord had commanded. However, though she pressed them for it then eagerly, the missionaries had no desire to break up that lovely family with a lone baptism; so, as the weeks passed, they began more and more to involve the whole Christensen family in their cottage meetings, with Karen’s help. All except the son Christen finally came around to listen and discuss, but he would have nothing at all to do with any “Mormons!” The daughter Maren soon became deeply impressed <span id="page-143"></span> also, but whether it was so much with Mormonism as with the handsome missionary, Elder Myrup, was not quite clear, even to the young lady herself. One could see that the son Laurs was somewhat moved by it all, yet was being held back by his older brother’s opinions. It is hard to stand against ridicule when one is seventeen! Christen the father seemed to have a lot of thinking to do about the whole thing. Most Scandinavians who were embracing the gospel in those days were poor or meek, but this Dane was neither. The little girls went about their own small affairs knowing naught of the magnitude of the decisions being made then in the home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christensens had been without a governess for a number of weeks, their former one having left in a huff when the Mormon missionaries had begun to call at the farmhouse. Seemingly a Mormon-hater, she had soon started some unkind rumors about them in the village; doubtless falling back on gossiping to seem important, having so little in and of herself in the world with which to put that point over, like so many of her kind. The word that her recent employers were “Mormon sympathizers” brought no immediate violence to the offenders, as she had likely anticipated. Certainly it was not like it had been in the area, and not so long ago either, when quiet, hard-working, honest farm families could be meeting with friends and neighbors, singing and praying one minute and the next facing a howling mob seemingly intent on their extermination. The reaction then, in the midst of that bitter winter, had more or less taken on the form of vehement talking “behind backs”, as it were. The usual rabble-rousers used up their energy in virile, abusive words against them, telling what they would do “come spring” perhaps. Some others of their friends and neighbors scowled at them or shunned them, and a number of their relatives who lived closeby ran right over to see what it was all about, and when they learned, commenced to call them “fools”. ‘Twas said the priest himself had plenty bad to say of them. Perhaps he was worried about his pocket money, since the family no longer joined his congregations. Christen senior couldn’t have cared <span id="page-144"></span> less what people said or how they reacted, though he was somewhat surprised at the bigotry of some of the best of them. But if there was bitterness on any side it could not hold a candle to the bitterness of the weather, which continued to beat, bite and bruise any flesh forced to be out in it for long. And so matters had stood in Kobberø when the new governess arrived.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The weather continued so through the rest of February and all of March that winter of 1865. Notwithstanding, the two Mormon Elders continued to labor faithfully with the Christensens and other farm families in the area, visiting them often and usually wading through heavy snow and enduring severe cold to do so. They now had quite a number of sincere investigators and a few others, like Karen and Maren, who were ready for baptism. The importance and influence of the Christensens had been quite a factor in bringing in investigators who were pleased to follow their example and who often came to meetings in their home. Baptisms in the open were impossible then, as the weather stood, but the missionaries were looking forward to spring when they hoped for quite a “harvest of souls” in Gettrup Parish. Though they had received no commitments from either Laurs Christensen or his father, they felt they were making progress, especially with the younger man, The new Mormon governess there seemed to be having quite an influence on his thinking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else Katherine Andersen was happy in the Christensen home, at least as happy as one could be under the circumstances of feeling quite forgotten by her own family. These people with whom she now resided had treated her most kindly; in fact she had been led to feel more like a member of the family than a servant. She had learned to love the gentle Karen like a second mother. They had much in common in their love for the gospel and often studied and talked of it together. Else’s special charges, the three younger daughters, were her delight. She had learned to love them with all her heart. The shy Pouline had come to trust her for she had done so much to encourage <span id="page-145"></span> the young girl in her special abilities. Trina had been no problem from the first; she knew they would be friends forever. The little one, Sena, had to be weaned somewhat from her mother’s skirts and Else fell back on the stories of her childhood to do this, for Sena loved stories and jingles. “Tommeltot fell in the water; Slikkepot fished him out; Langemand carried him home; Guldbrand put him to bed, and Lille Peder Spillemand sat in the corner and tattled.” This one the small girl learned to say, pulling at her own fingers the while. When it was time for bed the story about “Ole Lukøje”<sup id="fnref:2" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:2">2</a></sup> was what Sena coaxed for and she usually got it, since nothing else would quiet her. “Ole Lukøje comes up the stairs in his stocking feet, opens the door noiselessly – and st! – squirts a small, small stream of sweet milk in the childrens’ eyes to prevent them from staying open. He creeps among them and blows softly upon their necks… He doesn’t hurt them, for Ole is very fond of the children; he only wants them to be quiet…” By this time Sena was most always sound asleep. As Else tended and entertained the children, and as she taught them their lessons, she also taught them about the gospel, as her mistress, the gentle Karen, had suggested. Someday they would be baptised like she had been, in the deep water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">March passed and April came; these were the months for birthdays in Nørhaa — Mor’s, Far’s, Christen’s, Karen’s and Mads’. Mads had turned twenty now. Else longed to hear from her family but had received no word since coming to Kobberø, although she had written right away to send her address and tell of her circumstances. There had been plenty of time in spite of delayed mails. She hid her disappointment deep and went ahead with her work. The weather was warming at last and the Christensen men were preparing for their planting. Mr. Christensen she greatly admired, he was a man of strong character. Else trusted him and felt he did so with her. The son Laurs she had grown fond of for he was so full of wit and humor and such good company; besides he was becoming continually more sympathetic with the gospel teachings, as they discussed them. In all <span id="page-146"></span> but that he seemed much like her brother Mads. The older daughter, Maren, had kept her distance, as she could, seeming to be jealous of the apparent friendliness between Else and the missionaries, especially Elder Myrup. But had he not been the one to get Else this position? She kept well her secret that she knew about Elder Myrup and his hopes for Maren, as mentioned in his letter to Elder Hansen. The antagonistic son Christen bothered her, yet she pitied him — perhaps the war had made him that way; he had been young to go a-fighting - just like Mads. This one had so much happiness within his grasp but wouldn’t see it. He constantly complained of everything, including the farm work. He wished to try his hand at a craft or trade, ‘twas far better than working on a farm for a miserable salary, he said. He was handy at the making of farm implements, like his father, but disliked that too. He wanted to be off, that was the truth of it. There were many traveling craftsmen, tradesmen and salesmen in the area, and when the sun shone they came out like houseflies, plying their crafts and trades and making tolerable good businesses at them too. There were watchmakers, carpenters, shoemakers, harness and wagon makers, roof thatchers, salesmen of tin goods and lithographs, mechanics, etc., and even dressmakers and tailors, going from house to house and door to door peddling their wares and services.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Kobberø was situated near the meandering Limfjord, where an arm of it came twining itself through the land there in south Thy, reaching out northwesterly towards the sea and caressing green or sandy shores of bays, coves, inlets and smaller fjords on its way. On the fjord’s east bank, midway between the waters of Fjordgrund and Krik Vig, the village itself lay looking across ten miles or so to Thyborøn Harbor, or south to Nissum Bay in the distance. Where in this large and beautiful bay, Viking fleets and their fearless crews had gathered from north, south and east ten centuries before to await their devastating raids west across the North Sea. And farther northwest <span id="page-147"></span> from Kobberø, on past Krik Vig to the shores of this rough sea, near Aggerborg, can still be seen excavations from whence those early sea-kings once set forth in their long-ships. A fjord town or village on the shores of the Limfjord, such as Kobberø, was a lovely place to be in the springtime. Picture looking out towards Nissum Bay and seeing the sky reflected in enchanting, pastel colors in its blue waters, while crafts of all descriptions glide to and fro upon its surface, from small open fishing boats being rowed along to large sailing vessels with their giant white sails spread and their blur of red and white flags flapping in the brisk breeze. Imagine herring nets billowing against the blue sky between weatherbeaten posts of silver grey, flights of birds wheeling, dipping and circling in a water ballet, and far off on the very brink of heaven, flocks of plump little fleecy white clouds, like lambs grazing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here were smokehouses dotted along the green sloping shores. Danes were fond of smoked herring. In fact, most Danes were fond of fish of any kind, fish having fed their ancestors since the beginning - far longer than farms had. There were numerous fishermen in the vicinity of Kobberø and many there who loved the sea. It was often said, jokingly, that the children in this area were born with oars in their hands. Not all here, however, were sea-going Danes, for there were some, like the Christensens, who were proverbially reluctant to sail out farther than they could row back. For though they loved the water and had been raised to the rhythmic sound of its splashing, yet they much preferred having their feet firmly planted on solid ground, being land-Danes, as it were.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Many farms were scattered about, for Kobberø was primarily a village of farms, varying in size. A Danish farmyard could be a very picturesque place. The house and accompanying farm buildings were usually built around a courtyard in a sort of U shape, in the center of which would likely be a tall flagpole, watering trough, water pump, and possibly a windmill. Barn, pigpen, chicken coop, outhouse, granery, <span id="page-148"></span> smokehouse, corral and sheds, as well as the dwelling itself, would all be built in the country’s own products — grey stone, clay, forest wood and straw. The half-timbered farmhouse itself might boast a modern red tile roof, but the other buildings would all be thatched with straw. The individual farm largely supplied the food requirements of the family, outside of fish, salt, coffee, tea and some fruits. Cereal, root crops, potatoes, oats, barley and wheat were raised in abundance, as well as garden vegetables, berries, currants, prunes, rhubarb, etc. Some Danes even grew trees whose leaves were edible, such as the Bøgetrae whose branches were picked in the spring and placed in vases in the homes. Cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks and geese and the like, provided meat aplenty, as well as eggs, lard, bacon, cheese and butter. A favorite with some Danes was clabber milk, or “thick milk” as they called it. Good cooks were the rule in most farm homes and farmers and their families, like most other Danes, were generally well fed. Some of the materials for clothing, such as leather and wool, were raised on the farm also and most everything the family wore was made there, with the aid of traveling shoemakers, dressmakers, tailors, etc. Danish peasants or farm people were always well clothed, if not fashionably, but they could dress up as gaily as the best, in their “national costumes” if the occasion required it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Danes themselves were a fine race, usually tall and athletically trained. In the country districts, such as Thy, they were kind and hospitable with an easy independence of bearing. The natives of Thy, perhaps the harshest part of Denmark, were possibly more hardy and vigorous, in the main, because of the process of natural selection, the weaker ones dying off young. Jutland in general was sometimes referred to as the “dark continent”, particularly by Danes of the Island cities. This was probably because of the seeming backwardness of its people, the country manner and country dress, including wooden shoes, but more especially because of the peculiar Danish brogue spoken in parts such as Thy — “Danish words all chewed up and swallowed and then spit <span id="page-149"></span> out of the throat”, and sounding almost as harsh as the land was itself. But in spite of it all, the blood of Israel, and some of the finest blood in the kingdom of Denmark, flowed in the veins of the farming Jutlanders of Thy. Among these, and surely not the least of them, were the Christen Christensens of Kobberø. In fact, to many of the people of this area Christen Christensen himself was known as “the great man of the north”.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">News from other parts of the world came to Kobberø through the Danish newspapers, letters from emigrants and other world travelers, and from returning seamen. It must have been noted with interest there, as elsewhere in Europe, that the great American Civil War—a terrible internal struggle—which had been raging for more than three years had been finally brought to a close. On 9th April, that spring of 1865, the Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union forces under General Ulysses S. Grant. With this the famous American President, Abraham Lincoln, had not only freed the black slaves of his country but had preserved the Union as well. There was genuine rejoicing at this, not only in the United States but in other countries, including Denmark. However, five days later, the night of April 14th, in the midst of the joyful celebrations in the American capital city of Washington, D. C., while Lincoln was attending the theatre there, he was shot and killed by an assassin, John Wilkes Booth. The happiness of the world at this outstanding man’s successes turned as suddenly to sorrow at his death. Robert Ingersoll wrote of the great emancipator, Abraham Lincoln:— “He was the courage, the hope and the nobility of a nation. He knew no fear except the fear of wrong doing. Wealth could not purchase, power could not awe this divine - this loving man. It is the glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never abused it except on the side of mercy.” The famous story teller of Denmark, Hans Christian Andersen, was a contemporary of Abraham Lincoln and so was Christen Christensen of Kobberø. All lived at a time when great things <span id="page-150"></span> were happening in the world and important decisions were being made.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Seventeen days following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, while the world still mourned his passing, an event took place near Kobberø, Denmark, which was to change the lives of many people. On May 1st, 1865 a small group of Danish people wended their way down a green sloping bank to a cove of water which had stolen away from the main body of the Limfjord into a nook of the land there. Here it lay, sheltered from the wind and prying eyes, sunning itself. Among the group who came to disturb its placid waters that beautiful spring day were all of the members of the Christensen family of Kobberø (except the eldest son Christen), their governess, Else K. Andersen, the missionary Lars N. C. Myrup and his companion, and several others who had come, like the rest, either as spectators or for baptism. Two of the Christensen family were prepared to enter the waters of baptism that day: the mother, Karen Lauritzen Christensen, and the eldest daughter Maren. Karen was eager to be first for she had waited so long for that precious moment when she could become a real member of the L. D. S. church. She was baptized and then confirmed by Elder Myrup, assisted by his missionary companion. Maren came next and it was also Elder Myrup who baptized and confirmed her a member. Others from the small congregation assembled there on the banks of the cove were also baptized and confirmed, and then the simple services were ended. The gentle Karen had been given one of her greatest desires in life, yet she was grieved because her husband and her sons had failed to be baptized that day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen senior had been seriously considering the step for quite a while. In fact the urge to be baptized had kept yanking at his coattails for weeks but his Danish stubbornness had kept halding him back. Why hadn’t he thought of the whole thing first? The night following his wife’s baptism, as he and she were preparing to retire, Karen spoke to him of the great peace that had come into her heart with the administration of those holy <span id="page-151"></span> ordinances, and then she said, rather wistfully, — “But it will be so difficult to emigrate to Zion without you, my love.” These last words stunned him - that was something else he hadn’t thought about first either. Well now if this was how the wind was blowing it was a different matter entirely! Next day Christen made a special visit to the lodgings of the Mormon missionaries, and the following day, May 3rd 1865, accompanied by the two delighted Elders, he himself went down to the water and was baptized and confirmed a member of the new church by Elder Myrup, assisted by the other Elder. Five days later, 8 May 1865, another baptism session was held in the cove near Kobberø and the son Laurs (Lauritz Mathias Christian Christensen) and the daughter Pouline were baptized and confirmed members by Elder Lars Myrup, assisted by his companion, together with a few other investigators from Gettrup Parish. With this the gentle Karen’s cup of joy was almost overflowing. But there was still the son Christen, whose bitterness for the Mormons was growing steadily — yet a mother’s heart never gives up!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One could say this much for the father, Christen Christensen of Kobberø: whenever he went into something he went in all over! As far as he was concerned, from the moment of his baptism and as long as he lived, nothing was too good for the Restored Church and its missionaries. Right away he helped to secure a rented hall in the town of Gettrup where the few members of the church in the area could hold services. He and his family attended regularly and assisted in fellowshipping new members by inviting them to their home. They fed and entertained the missionaries and did everything they could to further the work of the Lord in that small part of His vineyard. It wasn’t long before a goodly part of the discussions at the meetings were about emigration. The Millennial Star, an LDS church publication printed in England but translated into Danish, carried this message:— “The poor, the pure in heart will be brought singing to Zion… let all who can procure a loaf of bread and one garment on their backs be assured there is water plenty <span id="page-152"></span> and pure by the way. And doubt no longer but come next year to the place of gathering, even in flocks, as doves fly to their window before the storm.” “Emigration” — this was a magic word now for these new Saints; to Zion they must surely go - next year!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The seasons moved ahead. Nightingales sang in the long evenings of late spring - a choir of innumerable, invisible musicians. At midsummer the cool waves of the Limfjord and its numerous water-relatives, and the various bathing beaches dotting their shores, attracted vacationers, bathers and boaters. In late summer and early autumn the heather began blooming. And then it was harvest time again. There was a bountiful one in Kobberø and all hands were called outside to help with it. Even the maidservants at the Christensens, including Else, were put to harvesting the crops. This would mean more money all around for emigrating, for by now it had been pretty well agreed that all who desired it would go to America the following spring. Elder Myrup would be going, as well as Else, and of course the whole Christensen family except Christen Jr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By now Else was receiving regular mail from home, from Mads and the girls, but not one written word had she from her parents. It was all the same small talk as usual, avoiding the fact that they were living in two separate worlds of believing. All were well at home, they said, except Christen, who was poorly. The warm weather had brought Stine out of of her ailment and she was blooming like a rose again. Neither she or Karen, however, had suitors yet. Marie was plumper than ever. Mor and Far were still very much upset with her and ashamed for her also, though they seemed to expect her back most any day, disillusioned, and ready to make amends for her sins, and her peace with the priest. Rumor had it that Rudolph would soon marry a girl from København and settle down there. There were always plenty of good wishes and much love included at the end, and sometimes a P.S. - “By the way, when are you coming back home?” So they thought it was just a little fling she was having. Perhaps She would never go back. But oh to link arms with <span id="page-153"></span> them again - to talk the way they had before - to sit together on the bench beside the door and watch the moon come up, and listen to the cry of the nightingale!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In November and December the wind was howling cold again. In the Christensen household every extra moment was being directed towards the goal of emigration. Instructions had been received from the Branch headquarters at Aalborg. It would be no simple matter to go from one life to another; to cross an ocean and a vast continent - to leave “Babylon” for the “Kingdom of God”. Six or seven months would be required, “Convert everything possible into cash”, the authorities advised; so Christen began disposing of his stock. No use feeding more than necessary through the winter; the hay and grain saved would bring a good price. “Be frugal and thrifty and save as much as you can toward leaner days” was suggested; so Karen watched the kitchen and the cooking more closely. Leftovers and scraps were good for sauces and soup stocks; fish balls in soup were cheaper than meat balls, and just as nourishing. Some of the help was dismissed but a sewing lady was engaged to come into the home and get started on wardrobes for the family. Maren herself was already an excellent little seamstress and made many of her own things. Her clothes were always just a little better than the ordinary. Sorting began; so much would have to be left behind, since the usual emigrant equipment was supposed to average not more than one hundred pounds per person. There would be no room for the unnecessaries and little, if any, for family keepsakes and treasures. They were cautioned to bring along a year’s supply of clothing, if possible. Costumes for sailing would differ from those that should be worn on desert trails and in the valleys of the mountains. Food would be supplied or could be purchased along the way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was a custom in Denmark at this time for the family farm to be passed down from father to eldest son. Young Christen would have been in line to inherit the Christensen property, had all been as usual; but it was now necessary that the <span id="page-154"></span> holdings be sold to assure emigration funds for the rest of the family. So Christen senior began casting about for a possible buyer for his land. Ready money was needed right away, because all who planned to emigrate were required to make deposits for their ship passages and railway tickets well in advance, in order that arrangements could be made with authorities both in Denmark and America. The fare from Copenhagen, Denmark, to the town of Wyoming, Nebraska, U. S. A., the outfitting place for the Saints who were to cross the plains in 1866, was about 82 Danish rigsdaler or $42.00 in American money for each adult person. Children could travel for half fare. This meant that transportation for the Christensen family for this part of the journey alone would cost around 440 rigsdaler. Else would be required to pay at least 80 rigsdaler in advance. The trip to Aalborg and from thence to Copenhagen would be extra and there would be money needed for supplies at Wyoming, as well as plenty to defray incidental expenses along the way. Christen Christensen was blessed in being a man of some means; most planning to emigrate were much, much less fortunate.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Besides the physical preparations for the going-away, there were moral and spiritual details to be looked after - the “Word of Wisdom” for instance. Snaps and tobacco were not difficult for the Christensen men to give up, once they put their minds to it, but tea and coffee were another matter. It was hard for Scandinavians to get along without their coffee. The hours of the day could be counted by the number of cups of coffee served in a Danish household. The old black coffeepot stood enshrined on the back of every kitchen stove, always filled with the hot beverage, ready for pouring. The early church authorities were somewhat lenient with the Saints of the northland where coffee was concerned, for this habit seemed to be such an intrinsical part of their lives. When the pure, cool drinking water of Zion could be substituted, it would be time enough for them to change.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christmas was a wonderful time for the Christensens and members of their household that year. There was genuine thanksgiving and rejoicing <span id="page-155"></span> among them, for all were filled with great hopes for the future, fully expecting to see the land of America and the Great Salt Lake before another Yuletide. Nothing was spared of jollity and good will. Friends and relatives from all around called in for the celebration, for word had been spread that this would be the Christensens last Yule in Denmark. If any guests were disappointed at the absence of pipe and bowl — too bad — it was the Mormon Way. There was love and friendship and tasty food enough for everyone - and coffee too. And there was dancing and singing and well-wishing. Christen himself was the best of dancers, as were the son Laurs and Elder Myrup too. If any visitors were shocked upon seeing a Mormon priest kick up his heels - well - too bad again!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Especially gay at that holiday time was the daughter Maren, for she had just been spoken for by the missionary, Lars Myrup. There were congratulations all around. Her parents were delighted; they could have hoped for nothing better than that their eldest girl should wed the beloved Elder who had brought them all into the true church. It was agreed that their marriage should take place at Aalborg, prior to them all leaving for Zion in the spring. The last thing in the world the couple wanted was a marriage in the Parish church at Gettrup; the priest there should be cheated of that. Lars Myrup was nearly four years Maren’s senior, she being six weeks short of seventeen while he was lacking three months of twenty-one, but everyone agreed they made a handsome pair. Else also was pleased for Maren and, when they had a moment alone together, confided in the younger girl that once, when she herself was seventeen, she too dreamed of marrying a good and kind missionary. She then told Maren about the letter Elder Myrup had sent to Elder Hansen, nearly a year before, in which he had told of having his eyes set on the eldest Christensen daughter even then. At this the wide-eyed girl flung her arms round Else and kissed her impetuously. Then she had known it all along, had the sly governess; and they both merrily together, as girls sharing secrets sometimes do. <span id="page-156"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was necessary for Lars Myrup to leave the Kobberø area soon after Yuletide and return to home in Myrupgaard, Lild Parish, in far north Thisted Amt. There were arrangements for him to make and the “where with” to be secured for his marriage and emigration. He would travel first to Aalborg to be relieved of his missionary responsibilities and also to sign up for emigration. Christen asked him if, while he was there at Branch headquarters, he would also declare the Christensens’ intentions of going. Then he entrusted his future son-in-law with 170 rigsdaler to deposit in partial payment for their passages, promising that the balance required would be forthcoming in a few more weeks. Before saying his goodbyes, Elder Myrup took his future brother-in-law, Laurs, aside for a bit of private conversation and advice. The burden of his words concerned marriage, as one might have supposed, but not his and Maren’s alone but the younger man’s as well, “Why not marry Else?” he said, “she will make someone an excellent wife - why not you?” Laurs put in that this might require some thinking! “The four of us could honeymoon together on our way to Zion - ‘tis far better that you take a Danish wife along than to have some foreigner set her trap for you in Zion”, Myrup continued. “Ja, perhaps so” Laurs answered. “Else is a strong girl and she could pull me across the plains in a handcart, if needs be - Ja, ja, there would be some advantage to that!” Trust Laurs to always make a joke. “Well, work on it”, said the Elder as they parted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That turned out to be a rather mild winter compared to the previous one. The forepart of February, Christen senior set out in this wagon for Aalborg to finish paying his deposit, exchange some Danish rigsdaler into American money, and get the general lay-of-the-land there. By strict economy Else had been able to save enough from her wages for her to give her employer 80 rigsdaler to deposit for her also. A couple of other new Mormon brethren went along with him for the same reasons. “The Aalborg Conference Emigration List of 1866” carried the following entries: Christen Christensen, age 48, born Flarup, occupation farmer, nationality Dane; Karen, 39, Kobert, wife, Dane; Lars M. C., <span id="page-157"></span> 18, Kobert, son, Dane; Maren, 16, Kobert, daughter, Dane; Pouline, 9½, Kobert, Dane; Petrine, 7, Kobert, Dane; Nielsine, 4, Kobert, Dane. (Some mistakes are here noted since Karen was born in Gettrup, not “Kobert” (misspelling of Kobberø); Maren was a few days of 17, not 16, and Pouline was past 10½, not 9½. (It is probable that Christen, like many fathers, could not remember the ages of his own daughters.) The entry on the list directly below that of the Christensens was for Else Kathrine Andersen, 19, born Hvidburg, spinster, Dane, and then opposite her name, in the “deposited” column, appeared the number 80. (We know Else was born in Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg Parish.) In the “deposited” column opposite Christen Christensen’s name appeared the figures 440 - 170 - 270, and farther over under the “exchange” column appeared the figures 800 - 19 = 819. In the ‘foreign coin” column was listed “paid 410.00”. This has been interpreted to mean that Christen Christensen deposited 270 rigsdaler, plus the 170 previously paid, or a total of 440 rigsdaler, for his and his family’s passage and railway tickets to “Wyoming” (listed under the “remarks” column). 80 rigsdaler were deposited in Else’s name. Christen also must have exchanged 819 Danish dollars for $410 in American money, and we are led to believe this money was in gold coins. It was perhaps while Christen was in Aalborg then that he was approached on the subject of contributing to the “Church Immigration Fund”. This was a fund which had previously been set up by the brethren in Salt Lake City, from which needy Saints could borrow for their emigration passage to Zion. Members with extra means, both in Utah and in the Missions, were asked to contribute to this fund. We have been told that our Christen Christensen was one of the generous ones in the Aalborg Conference, where the emigration of the Saints was concerned.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime, in Kobberø, Laurs had made up his mind about something, but he was having some difficulty in knowing just how to go about it. Since his older brother Christen had now taken off on his own and his father was gone for a time, he himself, being the only man of the family about, had much to do, inside and out. He <span id="page-158"></span> had a mind to spend some time with the governess, Else, but it seemed impossible to find her alone. She had wonderful energy and was so enthusiastic and helpful that she was in constant demand by someone or other in the Christensen household. His mother, the gentle Karen, leaned on this girl more and more, as it became apparent that she was was going to have another little one. How could he compete with his own mother and four sisters for the attention of one they all depended on so much? What chance had a lone man in a household of women, especially where any private courting was concerned?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen senior returned from Aalborg and he too had a job for Else. He would trust it with no one else but her, since his dear wife was then too ill to help him. Would Else make him a special lining for his waistcoat? This she would gladly do, she said, and she gave no thought to the big task it might be for it sounded simple enough in the asking. This must be kept a secret thing, her employer said, done after most others of the household had gone off to bed. ‘Twas the strangest hand sewing Else had ever done. Into each small section of the newly made vest lining was to be placed a gold coin and sewn all around; which turned out to be a tremendous job, When Laurs offered to help - hand her the coins or just anything - his father, sensing something or other in the wind, withdrew in his son’s favor. And so at last Else and Laurs sat there alone together, late into each night that it took to complete the job; he, like old Midas of the story, fingering the yellow gold and she sewing round and round each piece as she put it in the lining of Christen’s vest. He spieled off jokes, often one after the other, in great style, with no trouble at all; but when he tried to talk of the things nearest to his heart then, his tongue was tied. Else laughed but all the time she was drawn to this handsome young fellow with curly hair like like his father, and so good and kind and unassuming, like his gentle mother; yet somehow so very much like her brother Mads withal.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else hadn’t been able to bring herself to <span id="page-159"></span> write her family of her anticipated emigration. Actually she planned somehow to go home and tell them of it - and say goodbye. As the time drew nearer, however, she fled from the thought of it more and more. How did one say goodbye forever? Yet, when all was said and done, did her activities really matter very much anymore to those in Nørhaa? Occasionally the girl indulged herself in moments of self-pity, but then she brushed these aside by lifting up her voice in the songs of Zion, or by quoting from Psalms, such as:— “This is a day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it”. Then she was comforted and went bravely ahead, losing herself in the happiness and plans of others, and in their service.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon after the first part of March Else had. a letter from Mads, in which he told of Christen’s death in Nørhaa, 29 February that year (1866). he had suffered much, wrote her surviving brother, and he also included these statements:— “Christen, in his last days, was stirred to look inward into his sinful heart and consider the Lord’s goodness to repentant sinners and whatever else there is to believe in. Immediately afterwards, we other brother and sisters came in touch with the same way of life through a revival initiated by Grundtvig.” So,thought Else, they too were searching - for the truth perhaps. But they would never find it with Grundtvig! Then thinking again of Christen, she couldn’t help but recall the old verse:</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">“When the devil is ill, a monk he would be,<br class="calibre4"/> But when he is well, the devil is he.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Then at once she was ashamed and saddened and went outside by herself and wept. Laurs followed to give comfort and then they walked and talked until they had made their way together to where the land overlooked the water. There, in the distance where the winter’s ice had given way, the flying shapes of ships appeared. They themselves would soon be sailing!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are left to our own imaginings as to just where and when the important words were said between these two. This being a leap-year, she might have helped the young man out a bit and <span id="page-160"></span> popped the question herself, had she known of the custom. That Laurs M. C. and Else K. fell in love we can be certain, and that they planned to be wed in Aalborg in the month of April is also true.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In anticipation of her marriage, Else now wished for the lovely things in her brides-chest, and even the chest itself. But the amount of luggage allowed her on the voyage could scarcely accommodate all the necessary things, let alone these. Then she wrote home to her parents to tell of her future plans — her marriage to come and her expected emigration to America, both to take place within a month or so. She told them she lacked for nothing there in Kobberø since the family of her betrothed had taken her to their hearts like a favored daughter of their own. She asked that her sisters be given the things in her brides-chest and all else of hers, between them; she would have no room for any of these on the ship. She offered condolence for poor Christen, who had died a bachelor just short of twenty-seven. She made no promise of a visit to Nørhaa to bid them goodbye but she left the door open in hopes her parents would invite her, should the chance arise.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen Christensen sold his farm and homestead in Kobberø for half its value, with the stipulation that he and his household could remain there until mid April, or the time of planting. He sold the remainder of his crops and livestock as well, with the exception of his choicest team of horses, which he hoped to take along to Aalborg, together with his fine carriage, and dispose of them just before taking the ship. The rest of the family effects they couldn’t take with them they arranged to sell or give away to relatives and friends. Packing had been going on for some time, in valises, bundles and boxes; and two large trunks, for which they would have to pay an extra shipping fee, were filled with all the family’s best wearing apparel, together with the few heirlooms with which they were loathe to part. It was necessary too for all adults of the family, as well <span id="page-161"></span> as Else, to visit the civil authorities there and secure permission to leave Kobberø and have the official stamp placed in each individual identification book. It was lucky for Laurs that his request to leave came in peacetime, otherwise he would have surely been denied it and put right away in the king’s army. Another few months might have seen him in anyway, unless he had been lucky enough to “draw a pass”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The forepart of April the Christensens spent much time visiting their relatives and friends to say goodbye. There were Karen’s sisters, Maren Thomsen and Ann Jensen and their families, and Christen’s brother, Jens C. Christensen, and his three sisters, Karen, Marie and Anne, and their families. Yes, there were a host of their relatives all around the area, and friends galore. Many of them expressed sorrow for them - that such a promising family was being deceived by those “wicked Mormons”. They hoped that when they found out their mistake they would return to “dear old Denmark”. However, some expressed fear that the Mormons would kill them should they attempt to get away, or that the Indians would kill them if they stayed in this so-called “Zion”. They had heard that the redmen were on the warpath there now and killing the settlers right and left. As to their near relatives, none of them seemed inclined to listen to their testimonies of the Restored Gospel, although they bore them at every opportunity, but rather looked upon them as fools because they had joined so unpopular a sect as the “Mormons”. Some of their better-off friends and relatives rejected the gospel because they had too much of this world’s goods, others were not religiously inclined, and still others loved the ways of the world too much to repent of their sins and lead better lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the last places Christen and Karen visited was the Parish churchyard at Gettrup, where their four babies lay buried, as well as Karen’s parents and numerous relatives. She was especially nervous for fear the Lutheran priest would come out and revile them or at least forbid them to enter there; so they stayed <span id="page-162"></span> only briefly by the small graves and luckily saw naught of him. They were filled with sorrow and regret at having to leave friends and relatives, of course, but more so at having to leave their little ones there. Then there was their first born, Christen. It would be hardest of all to leave him in Denmark. They were grieved that they had been unable to bring him into the new Church and that they might never see him again or know his children, should he marry. It seemed almost like cutting off an arm or something, to be forced to leave part of their very own flesh and blood behind. It was not that they were worried about him getting on. In Denmark fourteen was considered the age when a peasant boy could take care of himself and only depend on his parents for good counsel and encouragement, and Christen Jr. would be twenty in a matter of days. He would be well taken care of where money was concerned, for a while at least; his father had seen to that. In this their son was most fortunate, for some fathers gave their sons only their names, though others may have included a lot of advice in the bargain. But Christen had been well taken care of all his days and had been given all the love and consideration that caring parents could bestow on a child. The young man had come home for their leaving and to pick up some things he wanted from there. He would not consent to going with them to Aalborg for a last parting, although his mother clung on him and wept when she begged it. In fact, he planned to leave Kobberø the day before they did. Bitterness against the gospel had hardened him, even towards his own people.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In order to leave the family free for their visiting, Else had taken over a good part of the responsibility at the farmhouse — besides, she had much to do for herself yet. Thanks to this generous family she would be properly outfitted for her marriage and the long journey afterwards. Her soon-to-be father-in-law had insisted on furnishing her with the money she needed and more; the gentle Karen had given her linens and bedding, including some lovely down pillows; Maren had helped her sew things and added some of her own, and the little girls had presented her with small <span id="page-163"></span> gifts and tokens. In fact, the entire family, except the son Christen, had so showered her with proofs of their affection that she would lack none of the material things to take. Laurs was often hovering about, indulging her whims and tending to her needs, as a true lover — it was wonderful to be a real part of it all. But there was something none of them could do for her; she had to make her own goodbyes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else was still hoping for a brief visit to her home in Nørhaa to have a look at them all there once again and to bid farewell; also she wished to introduce them to her betrothed. Laurs had promised he would take her there, on the way to Aalborg, should she wish it. They could leave Kobberø a day ahead of the rest and join them the following day along the road somewhere. Christen and Karen in fact had urged it, saying that by all means Else should go to see her own family before leaving for America. Eight thousand miles or more was a long ways away! But no word had come from anyone in Nørhaa in answer to her letter telling them all about her future plans, and time was short. Three days before their scheduled departure there was yet no word from her people and the disappointed young lady could still make no definite plans in regards to her home-going. But the very next day some mail arrived. There was a package from her sister Karen - some dainty underthings the sweet girl had made for her. There was only this brief word enclosed, however, — “For your marriage festival with love - from Karen”. There was quite a fat letter from Mads though, and Else’s fingers trembled as she tried to unfold it, she was so eager. Mads had written that the word of her forthcoming emigration had been a shock to their whole family, especially coming so close on the heels of Christen’s passing. The announcement of her planned marriage had upset them also, especially since it was to be to a “Mormon”. Their mother, Mette, was prone on her bed again, weeping. ‘Twas enough to have Else join the Mormons, she had said, without having her marry one and then, on top of it all, sail away with them across the ocean to their strange kingdom! They at home would never live this all down as long as they lived, or so said <span id="page-164"></span> their mother. Even their father seemed somewhat stunned with it all and kept repeating over and over, “No other Mormons shall ever set foot inside this cottage for they have robbed me of my daughter!” This was as Mads put it. Of course he himself could understand, he said, that love never asked the religion of its victims before attacking. But why was she so set on risking her life, as it were, on the sea, or on the great prairies where wild animals roamed in herds, or in the Rocky Mountains where wild Indians, with tomahawks and arrows, were bent on killing all intruders there? He closed by saying that her sisters sent their love, along with his; then added, “the older ones themselves would be most grateful for any husbands of their own, no matter what the variety”. So Mads could still joke, thought Else, although he should have known how terribly his letter would disappoint and wound her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Prayers are not always answered in the way petitioners desire them to be, but Else’s prayers had found an answer in Mads’ letter, for now she knew she could never go home again and take Laurs with her. Her goodbyes would have to be written. So she started with her sister Karen, thanking her for the pretty things she had sent and telling her of her love and admiration for her. Then she wished her well and bid her goodbye - “perhaps until we meet again in another life”. Then she wrote them each in turn, saying farewell, and to Stine she added something about Laurs, her betrothed, and what a kind, good and patient man he was. Though he was younger than she herself and no taller, being about her height, yet he was curly-haired, very manly and so handsome, besides being full of wit and humor. To the usual love and farewell she sent to Marie she also added the recipe for the Christensen family’s favorite dish, as well as other cooking suggestions. Then she invited her younger sister to come and visit her sometime when she and Laurs became settled in the Rocky Mountains. To Mads she wrote many things about the gospel, bearing her testimony to him and challenging him to seek after truth. “Each mind has to choose between the search for truth and repose” she told him; “one can never have both.” <span id="page-165"></span> She herself had chosen the harder-right over the easier-wrong and time would bring the reward. “Come sea, come prairies, come Indians”, she wrote; “the Lord will surely protect us!” It was most difficult writing to her parents, for her tears kept blotting out the letters and she had to start over again and again with - “Dear Far and Mor” - and then she poured her heart out to them in words of deepest affection and appreciation. She begged their forgiveness for any disappointment or unhappiness she had caused them; hoping that sometime they would understand. She asked the Lord’s choicest blessings upon their heads and promised to pray for them, in their declining years. Then she bid them a fond goodbye, as her tears streamed down unwiped. “Someday”, she wrote in closing, “we shall all meet together again in a brighter land, where love and trust prevail - were it not so, and did I not fervently believe it, my heart would break!” And then, as she sealed the letter to them, it suddenly came to her in a flood of yearning that no matter how long or far away she should roam, her childhood home would always call and reach out to her in voices unstilled by time and space.</p>
