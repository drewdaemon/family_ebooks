  <p class="calibre1">(38) Dale Carmen Christensen (7) was born 7 Oct. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the rock house that once belonged to his Christensen grandparents and which still stands today (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dale left Gunnison with his family when he was five months past six years old, having attended school one winter there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was married 16 Oct. 1929 in the Salt Lake Temple to Ruby De St Jeor (b. 4 Oct. 1908 in Lyman, yoming to William and Elizabeth Burnett De St Jeor). At present she is living in Nampa, Idaho and writes of him:— “Dale came to Wyoming as a child. He attended schools at Lyman, Evanston and Cheyenne. We met at a high school dance at Lyman. After our marriage we lived at Lyman for several years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Though his main hobby seemed to be reading, Dale always loved to work around machinery, trucks and heavy equipment. He started following construction work which took us to Oregon, Nevada and Idaho. (Dale, assisted by Ruby, owned and managed a large trucking concern in what was known as “The Dalles” Oregon for some time; also a service station). His last year was spent at Nampa, Idaho. He became an invalid here after suffering a heart attack and stroke. Dale had always had such perfect health prior to this.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 22 Sep. 1947 Dale and Ruby adopted a nine-year-old girl, Rosealyce (b. 3 May 1938 at Green River, Wyoming) but the experiment turned out to be a failure. Dale was a big, good looking man with beautiful brown eyes, inherited from his mother. He passed away in Nampa, Idaho, 10 Oct. 1958, three days after his fifty-first birthday. He was buried 14 Oct, 1958 in Lyman, Wyoming. He and Ruby have no descendants.</p>
