  <p class="calibre1">(57) LaPreal Bartholomew (5) was born 8. Feb. 1921 in Goshen, Utah; blessed 1 May 1921 by William K. Thomas; and baptized 20 July 1929 in Goshen Hot Springs by David Poulsen. In her mother’s Book of Remembrance she writes of her youngest child, LaPreal:- “She was born in a four-room adobe farmhouse on the ranch of Robert Boswell near Goshen, Utah. When five years old she had whooping cough and at age eight was vaccinated for smallpox. She attended the Goshen public schools through the first four years and then, since our family moved to Payson in 1931, she went to fifth grade in Payson where her teacher was Miss Melba Loveless. She finished the Junior and Senior High Schools in Payson and then entered Brigham Young University in the fall of 1939, majoring in foods and nutrition and receiving her BS degree in June of 1943.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 28 Apr. 1944 in San Francisco, Calif. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-918" title="918"></span> LaPreal married Gene Francis Loveless (b. 12 Feb. 1920 in Payson, Utah to Owen and Virginia Harper Loveless). A Payson newspaper later carried this report:- “The marriage of Miss LaPreal Bartholomew, daughter of Mr. &amp; Mrs. A. C. Bartholomew, and Lieutenant Gene F. Loveless, son of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Owen Loveless, was solemnized at the LDS chapel in San Francisco with. Bishop C. W. Nalder officiating. The double ring ceremony was used. The bride wore a beautiful, aqua-blue afternoon dress with corsage of gardenias and pink roses. Owen Loveless acted as best man for his-son. Immediately following the ceremony a wedding supper was given at the home of Mrs. Mable Harriman, grandmother of the bridegroom. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Loveless left for a short honeymoon trip. They will reside at Chico, California.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaPreal writes, “I married Gene F. Loveless during the height of World War II. This was no surprise since we had grown up and gone to school together in Payson. As a pilot in the airforce he was later shot down over Germany and died 6 Nov. 1944. His body was brought to Payson where he was given a military funeral, 12 Nov. 1944. We had no children and I have not remarried, instead devoted my time and energy to my profession, which is in the field of teaching nutrition to both the public and in schools.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Having received my BS in nutrition and education at BYU, I went to New York City and there received my MS and dietetic training from Columbia University Teacher’s College. Then I went to California where I received my MPH (the equivalent of a Doctor’s degree in my field) from the University of California at Berkeley. I went to Hawaii to teach in the college there where I arrived by boat 14 Sep. 1953. Thus I have lived in New York, Hawaii and California, which is now my home, and loved them all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I enjoy travel - seeing new people and places. My civic services have been in connection with my work in national and local organizations. I have no desire to set the world on fire but live a quiet life with my hobbies, friends and work.”</p>
