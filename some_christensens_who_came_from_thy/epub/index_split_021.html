  <p class="calibre1">After having made the decision to move to a land uninhabited except by the American Indians, the Mormon leaders admonished their people to deal justly with them following a policy of friendship and the “open hand”. Though this proved somewhat successful in the colonization of the area the sensitivity and emotional makeup of the Indian was such that a slight or often imagined grievance was enough to start a war. Such seems to have been the case in the “Walker War” that had bled the new territory in 1853-54, although frequent small irritations, and some not so small, had been leading up to this explosion for some years. As early as 1850 proud, haughty Chief Walker (Walkara) had planned to massacre the people of Fort Utah (Provo) because Brigham Young refused to send some of his settlers to aid Walker in a battle against the Shoshones. Fortunately, Chief Sowiette, the pioneers’ friend, interceded and calmed the fiery tempered Chief.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Mormon leaders were soon made aware that something more than food and friendship would have to be used to cope with the Indians. Their policy had been a noble one, but the frequent infringements by the red brethren - their child-like inability to refrain from petty thievery, as well as other irresponsible behavior - placed a great burden on the struggling settlers. As one incident after another occurred, President Brigham Young realized the need for some form of military organization and thus determined to reorganize the Nauvoo Legion, which had been an integral part of the Church in Illinois. This <span id="page-208"></span>was done at a meeting held in Salt Lake City April 12, 1852, where appointment of officers was made and Daniel H. Wells chosen as Lieutenant General. The defense of the people of Utah and the protection of their property became the major concern of this organization. Much vigilance and tact was called for by the Legion members.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In spite of the subduing of Walker and his warriors, who had vowed their war would last until all the whites were exterminated, and in spite of the peace treaty they had signed with Brigham Young in May 1854, the stealing and killings went on, causing much destruction of livestock and some loss of human life. Indian attacks on travelers and settlements usually came when least expected; for example: June 4, 1858 - Jens Jorgensen and wife, Jens Terkelsen and Christian E. Kjerulf were massacred in Salt Creek Canyon while traveling unarmed to Sanpete Valley; Oct. 15 - the remains of Josiah Call and Samuel Brown of Fillmore were found near Chicken Creek bridge in Juab County - the mutilation of their bodies proved it was the work of redmen; Mar. 22, 1860 - the Overland mailcoach was attacked by Indians near Eight Mile Station, Tooele County, with Henry Harper, the driver, being killed and a passenger wounded; May 28, in the same county, Indians attacked the mail station at Deep Creek, shot a man and stole several horses; July 22, Smithfield, Cache County was attacked by Indians and a fight ensued during which John Reed and Ira Merrill and two Indians were killed and several on both sides wounded; Apr. 12, 1863 - a band of about fifty Indians, led by Chief Little Soldier, attacked a group of soldiers from Fort Douglas who were camped at Pleasant Grove, Utah County, who frightened them away with a small cannon but lost their horses, blankets and supplies in the fray; June 10 - Wood Reynolds and another unarmed man were killed when a stagecoach was attacked by mounted Indians between Fort Chittenden and the Jordan in Utah County. The attacking Indians sometimes wore little clothing - a breech clout and moccasins being their uniforms. Some painted their faces black on occassions, but they always had guns, pistols or bows and quivers of arrows, besides their knives or<span id="page-209"></span>tomahawks. These were but a few of the many incidents leading up to the Black Hawk Indian War which engulfed the settlers in this territory from 1866 to 1869, particularly those of Sanpete, Sevier and other southern counties, becoming Utah’s bloodiest conflict of the last century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Black Hawk War is said to have officially begun at Manti in Sanpete Valley Apr. 9, 1865. Research seems to warrant the account presented by Carlton Culmsee as probably the most logical record of the event: — “Black Hawk sat in sacrament meeting one peaceful Sunday in Manti. He stared at the speakers as if absorbed in their words. Perhaps he was. Perhaps, however, the tall chief was thinking of a tribe of Utes not far away, who were full of superstitious anger at these white men. Those Utes were like dead leaves of rabbit brush, like good timber. If a spark fell among them – ! But whatever reveries Black Hawk had, he listened keenly to one part of the meeting. Plans were announced for rounding up the livestock in the district of the Indian farm at Twelve Mile Creek. This was to be the customary general spring roundup. Meeting ended. Black Hawk went to the house of James Tooth, where he customarily ate after the services.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, an historic event was occurring at Jerome Kempton’s place in the same town. Some leading Utes had met with prominent settlers to discuss the recent outbreak of cattle stealing. John Lowry and Archibald Buchanan acted as interpreters. In the circle of onlookers were Kempton, David Shand Sr., J.C. Madsen, Jens Madsen, Arthur Vorhees, Louis Kjar and Peter Munk. Matters appeared to be approaching an amicable settlement in the hands of these frontier diplomats, the interpreters. All that interfered was an irreconcilable among the Indians - Jake Arropeen. He was a young sub-chief whose father had died of the smallpox which had attacked the band the preceding winter. Jake believed the whites had enlisted the aid of evil spirits and murdered his father by supernatural means, so he refused to be soothed. He rode about shouting that he would “kill Mormons and eat Mormon beef”.<span id="page-210"></span>John Lowry at length became exasperated. He commanded the chief to be quiet. Suddenly someone cried ‘Lowry, look out! He’s going to shoot!’ Before the Indian could draw his bow, Lowry sprang at him. He seized him by the shirt collar and jerked him off his horse. He talked to him sharply and then released him, Some accountshav e it that Lowry was drunk, that he insulted the chief, infuriating the tribesmen. Thus the guilt for starting the war is frequently laid upon Lowry’s shoulders. But Peter Munk, one of the eyewitnesses, swears that version is false. He declares Lowry, in all sobriety, simply acted swiftly when warned of danger.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most of the settlers of this small community of Manti were in meeting on this apparently peaceful Sunday morning. A few of the men had stayed in front of the little store, talking. They had watched unconcernedly as Jake Arropeen rode into the fort. They were entirely unprepared for the swiftness with which the mood changed from one of peace to blatant danger as John Lowry and Chief Arropeen clashed in anger. Meanwhile, Chief Black Hawk, sensing further trouble, abruptly left the Manti fort and returned to the Indian camp where he hurried the squaws, children and old men, together with camp equipment, off to the mountains, leaving the braves in support of Arropeen, who subsequently also rode angrily away.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That afternoon the settlers called a meeting to see how best to handle this unexpected crisis. Realizing that their cattle which were roaming the entire valley would be most vulnerable, they asked for volunteers to start the next morning to round them up. Thus, on the morning of April 10th, a small party of unarmed men from Manti started for the Indian farm at Twelve Mile Creek to gather the stock. On the way they were attacked by Indians, who killed young Peter Ludvigsen and put the others to flight. They returned to the fort with word about Ludvigsen and soon a party of armed men on horseback, together with a team and wagon, set out to recover the body, which they found face down in a prickly-pear bush. According to Peter Munk, all clothing except the sox had been<span id="page-211"></span>removed and the Indians had cut a strip of flesh from the back. This they had roasted and each taken a bite - a sure sign of war with the Indians. The mutilated body was laid carefully: in the wagon and brought back to Manti for burial. Tat same evening Elijah B. Ward and James Andersen were killed and scalped by Indians in Salina Canyon, who also drove away a number of cattle belonging to the settlers there.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So a war was on and Black Hawk and his minions worked havoc. Raiding, stealing, torturing, plundering and killing became the Indians’ pastime. Their war-whoops could be heard, curdling the air as they swooped down unsuspectedly on the often helpless settlers. They seemed to specialize in the art of surprise and ambuscade. This became a time of terror as the savages came shooting their arrows and guns, killing and pilfering that which the Saints had built. It was a time when farmers could not work in their fields or go to the canyons for wood without the aid of armed men. Herds of stock needed guarding day and night. Even in the settlements themselves no one was safe. As a result, entire counties were abandoned by the frightened settlers and left to the redmen. The larger communities that had no forts were advised to build them, and here the homeless ones gathered for protection. None felt safe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was fortunate for the people of Utah that with customary foresight President Brigham Young had ordered the re-activation of the Nauvoo Legion. The machinery having therefore already been set up to protect the people, it remained only to alert every male resident of the territory as to his duty in the common struggle; for although this war was initially contained in the two counties of Sanpete and Sevier, it soon spread until nearly every area of the State was more or less affected. Brigham Young issued the following instructions in Aug. 1865:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It is required by the laws of the Territory of Utah of every male citizen from eighteen to forty-five to be armed and equipped and ready for any duty he may be called upon to perform as one of the militia of the county; and if any refuse<span id="page-212"></span>to obey the laws of the land, I would try them before their bishops for that as readily as I would if they were to refuse to pay a just debt; and if they would not repent I would sever them from the Church and give them over to the laws of the land. I do not know that there is one person in the Territory who would refuse to perform military duty, there are strangers in our midst, but I very much doubt if one could be found who would refuse to do military duty.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The history of the Black Hawk War is filled with incidents of the killing of men, women and children without warning or a chance to defend themselves. During the first year alone it was estimated that the Indians drove off as plunder 2,000 head of cattle and horses and killed between 30 and 40 whites. Manti became the center of activities against the redmen, although they were pursued and attacked in many different locations. General Warren Stone Snow was given full command of the Sanpete military district in 1865 and played a conspicuous part in the war. Nauvoo Legion cavalry companies from Davis, Salt Lake, Utah and other northern counties made Manti their headquarters on many occasions to assist him and his men in their efforts to save the lives and property of their fellow sufferers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Oct. 17th of that year, Martin Pedersen Kuhre and wife, Elizabeth Petersen, William Thorpe, Soren N. Jespersen, Benj. J. Black and William T. Hite were killed by Indians led by Chief Black Hawk. This happened near the settlement of Ephraim, Sanpete Co., six miles north of Manti. This was the last raid of the year in that area, as the Indians there, well supplied with “Mormon beef” for the winter, withdrew to their hideouts in the mountains. But the Indian War continued in the warmer parts of southern Utah and a number of the smaller settlements there were abandoned by the settlers. The campaigns of these cunning natives could not safely be minimized, let alone be regarded with disdain or contempt. Otherwise inefficient, these redmen were dangerously proficient in their specialized skill, the art of war. Their guerrilla tactics kept<span id="page-213"></span> the frontier settlements in hot water, to say the least, and the militia on the jump.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The spring of 1866 had scarcely broken when the redskins swooped down from their winter retreats to carry on their devilish sport of plundering and killing again. Horror once more rode bareback through the valleys! The sound of big bass drums boomed out over hamlet and village; men grabbed their guns and headed for their horses and women snatched up their little ones and ran to shelter for their lives. All settlements south and east of Salt Lake City were placed in a state of defense and Nauvoo Legion troops were ordered to the scenes of hostilities. Apr. 2 Joseph and Robert Berry and the latter’s wife were killed by Indians near a ranch on Short Creek in Kane county. Apr. 20 - The Indians attacked Salina, Sevier county, drove off about two hundred head of stock and killed two men who were guarding them. Soon afterwards the settlers vacated Salina and removed to Gunnison, Sanpete Co. No one knew when or where the bloodthirsty redskins would strike or who would be the next victim.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">May 1st - President Brigham Young sent out a proclamation instructing the people in Sanpete, Piute and Sevier counties to collect themselves together in bodies of not less than 150 men, arm themselves well and protect their people and stock from the Indians. Guns were scarce and many a white brother traded a good steer for a poor rifle during those treacherous times. The able-bodied men of the communities were gathered together into fighting groups and often spread out over the country chasing the foe, sometimes leaving only the women, children and elderly men in the thinly settled areas. On such occasions the people realized their helpless condition, especially when the beat of the big drums warned them Indians were coming, and they gathered in fright into the small public squares with pitchforks and shotguns, while whooping Indians could be seen driving their herds away and shooting down their brothers and sisters before their very eyes. Armed militia were once again sent from the counties to the north to help those in Sanpete and Sevier, while <span id="page-214"></span>the few remaining residents of Piute county moved together into Circleville.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">While the hostile redmen craftily avoided the military on most occasions, yet they continued their atrocities upon the settlers, as well as the raids on their livestock. Striking sometimes north, sometimes south, they drove the white men’s herds off into the mountains, killing anyone who got in their way. By the late autumn of that second year of this bloody war it was estimated that, like the year before, over 2,000 head of cattle and horses had been stolen, as well as about fifty Indians and more than twenty whites killed. It was further estimated that at least 2,500 men were under arms during that year of 1866. What a sacrifice in lives, time and means for a poor, struggling territory to be forced to endure!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">In Salt Lake City that latter part of October, the Abner Lowry company of Scandinavian emigrants and their escorts loaded up once again, in preparation for the remainder of their journey, and headed south towards Sanpete Valley. Capt. Lowry and his associates were anxious to get to their homes and families in the various settlements there. The newly arrived Saints must surely have been initiated into the threat of the Black Hawk Indian war through numerous, frightening tales of raids and killings in the area where they were going. The guards and teamsters were well armed, as was usual on such trips, and although the fear of Indians was not as great or attacks as likely when approaching winter spread its mantle, yet it was always advisable now to be prepared and on the lookout for dusky intruders; not knowing when uninvited guests might come with arrows and tomahawks!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the wagon train moved out of Salt Lake Valley the Christensens from Thy were aboard. Most everyone was allowed to ride on this trip, since the loads had been considerably lightened. Christen Christensen himself was very much disturbed about something. During the excitement and confusion of their arrival and welcome in Salt <span id="page-215"></span>Lake City - greetings from friends - passing on the news and such from Old Denmark and all that Hans Jensen’s orphans had disappeared! Someone had come to Tithing Office Square and taken them away unbeknown to the Christensens, who had subsequently been unable to find out who it was or anything at all about their whereabouts. All questions and searching had failed to turn up one thing on the matter. So, as they rode along south, Christen fretted about this, perhaps more than he did about Indians. He had fully intended to make arrangements for the future care and keeping of those children himself.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ox-drawn wagons stopped at each settlement of any consequence enroute to let off a few passengers and their baggage, but the majority were going to Sanpete. They could scarcely make more than twenty miles in an average day, since it was necessary for the animals and teamsters to rest at intervals, particularly at nights. Also, night driving could prove extremely dangerous with Indians on the warpath. Naturally the teamsters made great effort to reach a settlement for each evenings camping, since this was far less risky and a heap more pleasant and comfortable with friends from these places around them. Sometimes merriment and entertainment were provided specially. Pleasant Grove was selected for the first nights rest, and here they bid farewell to young Andrew Jenson, his brother and parents who had joined them at Salt Lake, having left the Scott company there earlier, as well as what was left of the Warnick family. Capt. Scott’s train had gone directly to Utah County where its wagons had mostly come from, so the Lowry group were able to renew pleasantries with some of their former “Kenilworth” friends in that place, as well as in other Utah County settlements at which they stopped to rest.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the emigrants from Little Denmark viewed the patchwork of farms and stretches of sage along their line of travel, they must have been impressed with the vast amount of good, fertile land yet to be tilled in Utah. It was not so in the Old Country where they came from. Stopping at Nephi in Juab County about their fourth night out, they undoubtedly <span id="page-216"></span>viewed that village with interest, since they had heard of some of the Indian troubles that had taken place in early spring of that very year, when many Indians had been taken prisoners and jailed there, including several Indian Chiefs, who were later taken by General Snow and his men to Manti, where they eventually broke jail. The travelers could have heard here of a recent outrageous attack (Oct. 23) on a family near Beaver, Utah, when Indians surrounded their ranch house at daybreak, set fire to the roof and tried with guns and pitch forks to exterminate the occupants and would have, save for the heroic flight for help of a young boy. Such stories sent chills down most spines; and if any of the Lowry company had put Indians out of their minds at that point they must have been jerked up to a state of renewed vigilance at hearing of those details.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just east of Nephi lay Salt Creek Canyon through which they had to pass. It had proved to be a dangerous route for whites during any Indian trouble. A number had been ambushed there that very year. The road was narrow, rough, muddy and snow patched then, winding through hills often pressing close on both sides obstructing the view. It was easy here for savages to swoop down on unsuspecting travelers and be off again up a well hidden canyon as fast as they came. As the Lowry ox train picked its way through, we can be sure that most of its passengers were on the lookout and filled with apprehension, if not outright fear. The end of this canyon marked the boundary line between Juab and Sanpete counties, and beyond that south six miles was Fountain Green, a small settlement with a newly built rock fort. Located on Uinta Creek, it was first called Uinta Springs but later changed to Fountain Green because of the water running from a spring in the mountains and spreading over the beautiful green grass meadow where the small village lay. This had become a favorite camping place for settlers going to and from Salt Lake to south Sanpete. Early that past spring the people of Fountain Green had been ordered to move to the Moroni Fort about seven miles south, as a protection against Chief Black <span id="page-217"></span>Hawk’s warriors, as their settlement had been subject to several Indian raids. While living in Moroni that summer of 1866, the Fountain Green settlers had built a fort of their own and had just moved back to the settlement to occupy it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It had been decided beforehand that Christen Christensen and his younger daughters, Pauline, Petrine and Nielsene, as well as Anne Jensen, would stop off at Fountain Green and spend the winter with friends there and in Moroni. The family things therefore had been sorted and repacked in preparation for it, since Laurs and Else, Maren and Lars Myrup were continuing south to Manti. It had also been pretty well decided that Christen and Anne would be wed soon after they reached their destination, He desperately needed a mother for his children and Anne seemed just the one for the job. She had proved to be well qualified for it and the little girls loved her; besides she and Christen had become very fond of each other. Elder Morten Lund, who had come all the way from Aalborg in their company, also dropped off at Fountain Green for this was his home and here his wife and children awaited him. It is quite possible that it was Elder Lund who, nearly three weeks later (Nov. 17, 1866), performed the marriage ceremony that made Christen and Anne husband and wife.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The rock fort there had been constructed much like other forts in the territory. Its inner walls backed each dwelling and all doors opened into it. On each corner was a bastion where guards were on the lookout at all times. One large gate provided the only outside entrance to the fort, and all public gatherings were held in its center. Drums were beaten to warn its inhabitants of any approaching enemy. Into this fort Christen, Anne and the girls moved, as well as any other incoming emigrants of the Lowry company who had chosen to stay at Fountain Green. Likely Christen had long since disposed of the last of his vest lining gold pieces, for it has been said that he spent his last change here to buy milk for his young daughters. No matter, the settlers there must have just moved-over-a-bit and taken <span id="page-218"></span>them all in, for that’s the way folks were in early Utah Zion.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">It was some twenty-eight miles south from Fountain Green to the town of Manti, largest and oldest permanent settlement in Sanpete Valley. It was the first of November before the remainder of the company reached there. Many had been dropped along the way. Here the teams and passengers disbanded - it was the end of the line. It had now been six-and-a-half months since the Christensens left their home in Thy, but in the interim they had crossed a mighty ocean and a vast continent - from lowland seas to highest mountains - left all they had to start other homes. It is hard for us of this jet generation to comprehend the magnitude of it from their point of view. Far more difficult than the physical hardships, the partings, the tedium of sailing ship and plodding ox team travel and all that, was the putting behind them of old thinking, language, habits, beliefs and old securities - to face the unknown. As Laurs and Else Christensen and Maren and Lars Myrup alighted in Manti, with little ought but their meager baggage and each other, they might have said to themselves in their mixed up broken English, — “Ja, Ve are here but vot now?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Manti then was a seventeen year old settlement, having been first occupied by Mormon pioneers in November 1849. Many were the tales told of those first struggling years of rattlesnakes, grasshoppers, drought, hunger, Indians, massacres, death - but then again of courage, steadfastness, brotherhood, building, romance, miracles and thanksgiving. The inhabitants had built a fort around them during the Walker War (1854) as a greater protection against destructive redmen. Called the Big Fort, it consisted of a continuous rock wall twelve feet high, three feet wide at the bottom and two feet wide at the top, surrounding an area of some nine square blocks or more, beginning at the corner of First North and First East streets and running south and west from there. Bastions were built on its southeast and northwest corners. Manti Creek ran diagonally through its northeast <span id="page-219"></span>part, supplying plenty of water. Thus fortified, the town itself had grown up mostly within this wall, with dwellings of adobe, log, rock or even dugout, as well as a few stores and businesses situated here and there at intervals along its streets. A square block in the central part of the area was set aside as a public square and known as the “Tabernacle Block”. On this block were housed the two main points of community interest, the “Bowery” and the “Council House”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Every early Mormon settlement had its “Bowery” and Manti was no exception. A huge shed supported by logs and roofed with thick layers of boughs and willows was erected where the Manti High School was later located. This open-air affair sheltered Conference goers and worshipers in summers and inclement weather. It accommodated the whole of the townspeople on Fourth and Twenty-fourth of July celebrations and such. Even after new quarters were built for worship and celebrations, it became a playground for school children in bad weather until it collapsed one rainy day, suddenly and without warning, catching a group of boys under its sodden mass. Luckily none were killed, though some were dazed or injured - but the whole town was wild with excitement while it lasted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The “Council House”, a large two-story rock building, had been erected in 1855-56 just east of the Bowery on the site where the Manti Library now stands. It served the people of the town well for fifty years. Everyone went to church there, but it was the place of many other activities as well, since educational, social, civic and recreational functions of all kinds were held there too. It is surprising the variety and extent of such things the people of Manti found time for in those early days, with so much hard work to be done. Concerts, dramas, musicals, rallies, dances and celebrations of all kinds were held in the Council House, for it seemed that the buoyant spirit encouraged by the pioneer leaders, as a balance against trials and hardships, waxed strong in the bosoms of those early “Sanpeters”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The upper story of the Council House was <span id="page-220"></span>approached by a narrow wood stairway climbing an outside wall of the building. In the late ’60s it became necessary to strengthen the upper floor by adding supports underneath. A stage and dressing rooms were added to that second story at the same time (1867) so that the home dramatic companies who held forth there on various occasions could put on better productions. Dances were also held on the top floor and this was by far the most popular of all forms of entertainment with most of these early settlers. Dancing parties on this rough, knotty-pine floor to the music of “Fiddler Hansen”, as he taught new jigs and steps, were the constant delight of anyone in Manti old enough or bold enough to “trip the light fantastic”. Whatever one called for - quadrilie, Mazurka, Schottische, Waltz-quadrill, Heal-and-Toe Polka, French Four, etc. he had it!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must in no way be assumed that entertainment and jollity took precedence over worship in early Manti, for indeed such was not the case. Here nearly everyone went to church, for that is what had brought them all west across wilderness and oceans in the first place — to be able to worship how, when and where they chose, and in peace and safety. It so happened that the first settlers of Manti were mostly Yankees, in whose veins flowed the blood of Pilgrims and Puritans. Theirs was a heritage of worship, Scandinavian emigrants, much humbled by persecution, sacrifice and privation, had later come in numbers and been added to the fold. They were even more reverent in spirit, if this were possible, having been well taught by humble missionaries and having felt the hand of the Almighty all the way in their travels to the “Promised Land”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That very year of 1866, as an added protection during the Black Hawk War, another rock wall had been built within the Big Fort, enclosing the Tabernacle Block. A fence was built through the center of this “Little Fort”, dividing the enclosure so that one part could be used in case of Indian attack for corralling the town’s stock. If the big bass drums sounded a warning, in from the surrounding farms and fields the cattle and horses would be driven on <span id="page-221"></span>the run, while into the other side of the divided area the women and children would flock for safety.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The only means of communication with the outside world in the Utah Territory, outside of the Great Salt Lake area, was by walking, or trips made on horseback, or by horse, mule or ox-drawn conveyances. This must have been a lonely and even frightening situation to contemplate, especially in times of trouble. (In our age, when one can witness and hear events all over the world with a flick of a button, we can in no way imagine what this would be like.) There must have been rejoicing in the various areas involved then, when on Sat. Dec. 1st, 1866, the Deseret telegraph line was opened between Salt Lake City and Ogden; on Dec. 8th opened between there and Logan; and on Dec. 28th opened between Salt Lake City and Manti. (It is difficult to evaluate the importance played by the Deseret telegraph operators in Sanpete Valley during the remaining years of the Black Hawk War, as they took turns nights, sleeping on the floor of the office in case word should come from neighboring towns that the Indians were on the warpath. If an attack were coming the people would then be warned of the approaching danger by the rapid beating of drums.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Having been taken into the homes of Danish friends for the time being, the two young emigrant couples must have made themselves as comfortable and useful as they could. The two brethren, Laurs M. C. and Lars C. N. must of course, have been taken into the militia right away and given their assigned work there as guards, minute men, armed cattle herders, or whatever. Since it was now considered too late in the season for any large scale Indian operation, they probably went into the mountains with others to get out logs and rock for contemplated dwellings of their own or the community, as well as wood for ever-hungry fires. That they toiled though we may be certain, for most everything there then was on a cooperative basis and all shared and shared alike.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else and Maren as well must have had their share of work, learning the new “American” ways of keeping house and concocting victuals “a-la-mode”; <span id="page-222"></span> knitting, weaving, spinning, seaming, mixing, baking, churning, candle making, soap making, soup making - there was never any end to it. Undoubtedly they were able to teach the Yankee settlers some things too; there must have been quite a transplantation of Scandinavian culture to Sanpete Valley. Trying to learn the new language was a chore in itself; yet with so many Danes around, it could scarcely have been considered a pressing necessity to learn English. But Else at least was determined in this and somehow she seemed more apt at it than the others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Being so friendly, healthy and young, they must have found time for dancing in the Council House and other entertainment and cultural events also. If there were any sports in order, like wrestling, horseshoes, handsprings and the like, one was bound to find the two young Danish brethren, Christensen and Myrup, there. Quilting and rug bees doubtless attracted the girls; and if spelling bees were ever held in the Danish language, one would surely have found Else K, present, for she took eagerly to things of that nature. She knew her Danish! (But as long as she lived she never quite got her English V’s and W’s straightened out.)</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">January 23, 1867 the Deseret News carried a speech by President Brigham Young, from which we quote excerpts: — “All our past experience with the subtle Indians teaches us the force of the principle ‘Eternal vigilance is the price of safety’. There is no season of the year when those who are exposed to the aggressions of the savages should relax their guard. We know that brethren in those regions have had much difficulty and hope they will keep their stock well guarded and lives and property preserved. Solitary individuals being or moving about, where Indians are liable to pounce upon them and kill them, manifest a degree of carelessness which is highly culpable. We earnestly hope that the brethren south will adopt every means in their power to guard against such dangers.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Early in 1867 it became plain to the settlers in Sanpete and Sevier counties that they were in for <span id="page-223"></span>another year of trouble. Many rumors were heard of depredations that were to be committed in the spring, such as; “When the snow is gone the Indians are going to get mad, east, west, north and south!” Thus, having tormented the settlers in the far south of the territory off and on all winter, the redmen began moving north in early spring. In large numbers they came from south and east, filled with new vigor and determination to massacre and mutilate the white settlers, or so it seemed. “Tue. Mar. 19th 1867, an attack was made upon Glenwood and the pioneer blacksmith, Merrit Staley, was killed and many of their livestock were taken. While some believed that the audacious Black Hawk was leading the raiders here, most historians know it was the daring Chief White Horse.” — “Mar. 21st, Early in the morning Jens Peter Peterson and his wife, Charlotte Amelia, with Mary Smith, a neighbor girl, left Richfield with ox team to go to Glenwood about five miles east to do some trading, having left their 18-months old baby girl with Mary’s mother. Stores were few and Glenwood had one of the largest. In order to obtain some needed supplies, these people had ventured out, thinking that by starting early there would be no danger; though it was contrary to counsel for anyone to travel between settlements without armed escort. Because it was muddy they could not travel as fast as they had expected. When they came to the so-called “Black Ridge”, east of the Sevier River, Indians were gathering stock along the river bottom. The redmen immediately attacked and killed Peterson and his wife. Mary Smith, shot through the arm, jumped from the wagon and ran down the hill; but as she got to the bottom an Indian shot her through the back. The savages scalped the man and woman, mutilating their bodies terribly, then leaped down the dugway to finish off the girl. Finding she had curly hair they left her scalp, as they were very superstitious of curly hair. They filled her wounds with rabbit brush. These atrocities were soon discovered and the citizens of Glenwood took after the Indians and gave battle. The Indians, however, were victorious and also succeeded in getting away with <span id="page-224"></span> about one hundred more head of stock. Such reports shocked all who heard them and Brigham Young, much concerned, counseled the bedeviled settlers to move north into older and stronger towns for safety.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus nearly all settlements on the upper Sevier and all in Kane and Piute counties were deserted by their inhabitants. Teams were sent from Manti, with a company of minutemen, to assist in moving all the residents of Glenwood and Richfield into Sanpete county. A policy was inaugurated placing all the livestock of the occupied settlements in Sanpete under strong guard both night and day, for these animals meant life to the communities in more ways than one, Companies of militia were sent in from the north to assist in the struggle, making their headquarters in Manti as they had the year before. General Snow was released as head of the Sanpete military district, which comprised all of southeast Utah, and General W. B. Page took his place. A “get tough” attitude was taken against the warring Indians, for the settlers were determined to have peace and safety or the extermination of every Indian throughout the land. The militia were authorized to kill every Indian buck who came on their trail and to spare only the squaws and papooses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But if vigilance was relaxed in any degree, neither the cattle guards nor the military were any more safe than others, as was evidenced by the following: — “At Fountain Green it was customary for a guard of at least ten men to be with the cowherd. On the morning of June 1st 1867, however, only five men were with it, the others having been detained in the settlement. As feed was plentiful the herd was taken only a short distance from town to graze. Two of the herders were stationed nearby on a knoll below which their horses were feeding. The other three were on the other side of the herd in a hollow by a ditch, cleaning some rabbits they had just killed. Those on the knoll saw ten persons riding fast from the east hills towards the herd, but thinking they were the additional herders, paid no more attention until the oncoming riders began shooting in their direction. The Indian group divided <span id="page-225"></span>as they drew near the outnumbered herders, six of them riding toward the two on the knoll who, having no time to warn their companions, rode quickly away for help. The other six Indians came upon the unsuspecting three in the hollow, shot young Lewis Lund in the center of the forehead at close range, wounded Jasper Robertson in the thigh but missed the third man. Then they took off with the herd. The body of Lund was later found, his powder-burned face down in Water Hollow ditch.” The very next day, June 2nd, between Gunnison and Manti, at Twelve Mile Creek, another melancholy incident occurred. “Major John W. Vance, together with Capt. Miles, Sergt. Heber Houtz and Pvt. Nathan Tanner Jr., were just returning to Gunnison from a military drill in Manti. At dusk, while halting at the creek to water their horses, they were fired upon by ambushed Indians at close range. At the first fire Maj. Vance and his horse fell dead and Sergt. Houtz, with a groan, also fell from his horse as the animal wheeled suddenly out of the creek, Miles and Tanner, believing their companions to be dead, headed back to Manti for help in recovering the bodies. Later, Vance was found where he fell, pierced with two bullets, but Houtz had evidently recovered himself momentarily, after the first fire; for his body, shot with two bullets and seven arrows, was about five hundred yards from the scene of ambush.” The savages always gave good measure when it came to shooting. If these tales seem remote to us, like something out of Cooper’s novels, we should remember that these Danish progenitors of ours were very near to these things and perhaps more deeply involved in them than we can imagine. It was only with great fortitude that these people were able to save their lives and homes from these savage intruders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Winter being a good time to work at building, it is likely that young Christensen and Myrup went about building shelters of some sort for themselves and their wives, on plots that had been alloted them within the confines of the Big Fort. Whether these were of rocks, logs, or merely dugout ones, is not known by us. One-roomed log cabins with possibly a lean-to each seems logical. They doubtless had <span id="page-226"></span>help from others of the established settlers and by spring of 1867 were able to move into their own quarters - their first real homes in the Valleys. That spring as well, Christen, Anne and the three girls came down from Moroni, where they had spent most of the winter; traveling in a company escorted by armed guards, as advised by the Prophet Brigham Young. Quarters for them were needed too. Perhaps they moved in temporarily with the two couples, or it may have been with Danish friends, while a house for them was erected.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Manti became a beehive of military activities again that spring and summer, with the Legion companies from the north marching and maneuvering to the sound of fifes and drums, and sometimes dashing off here and there on their mounts to the aid of stricken settlers or quickly forming into battle lines if the big talking-drums warned of approaching danger to the Big Fort itself. And not to be outdone, the local brethren, who were organized into various companies called the “Silver Grays”, gathered each morning on the Tabernacle Block for early drill, summoned forth by the call of bugles. Individual assignments for each day followed as some were detailed as picket-guards for the town, others as members of scouting groups to search hills and cedars for signs of skulking ‘Injuns”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Still others were charged to guard those who worked in the fields, or in the hills at logging, while others acted as minutemen, whose duty it was to be off and fighting at a moments notice should the bass drums call. Then there were always those sent to guard the town herd. At a given time each morning during the growing season, all the town cows would be brought by their owners to the stock enclosure on Tabernacle Block where well-armed guards would take them to pasture for the day’s feeding.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs Christensen and Lars Myrup both served with the Sanpete militia, first under General Warren Stone Snow and later under General Page. Christen Christensen himself also served in the Black Hawk Indian War, even though he was well past forty-five when men could be released from that military duty. (Nearly twenty years after his death his wife Anne received a pension <span id="page-227"></span>settlement for his service in that war.) Knowing the caliber of these Danes we can be pretty certain they never shirked any duty as sagebrush-soldiers. As they filled their various assignments each day, little could they have known that years and years later one of the sons of Laurs would wed a granddaughter of this same General Snow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs was a private in Captain John H. Tuttle’s co., Utah Militia Infantry. One day he was one of a number of guards detailed to take the town herd to graze near Warm Springs, south of Manti, for here the grass grew lush and green from early spring to late fall. On this particular day the horse Laurs was riding became frightened, jumped sideways and reared up, throwing him off, while one of his feet still remained caught fast in the stirrup. The horse then started out on a run and it looked as if he were to be dragged to death, when suddenly his shoe gave way and he was released, bruised and scratched to be sure - but safe! On another occasion Laurs was sent to drive a team of horses and covered wagon carrying some supplies from Manti to the settlement of Ephraim, some six or more miles north. As far as we know he was alone on this trip. When he came within a mile or so of his destination his attention was drawn to the foothills on his right where he could see some horsemen approaching in a cloud of dust. It wasn’t a moment until the wild whooping of the riders struck him with stark fright - “Injuns!” — there was no mistake. Quickly he tied the lines to the wagon box or seat somehow and slipped down onto the wagon tongue between the then thoroughly frightened horses, trying to calm them and yet urging them on faster and faster in almost one and the same breath. Soon the Indians came within range, pulled their bows and let fly in his direction, piercing the wagon box cover and drivers seat over and over in a rhythmic tattoo of arrows. From his hidden, awkward position Laurs could also hear the arrows whizzing over the backs of the animals above his head. A merciful heaven must have been on guard that day for he and the team reached the outskirts of Ephraim and safety, unscathed by the redmen’s darts. Although Laurs was cramped, lame and in <span id="page-228"></span>a state of shock, he recovered and was soon returned to his home and family again, safe and sound in the main. If Else fussed and worried over him and his narrow escapes he probably passed it off in such a manner, -_ “There’s no need to be afraid my dear! Haven’t I told you time and again that no Injun buck will ever wear my curly-haired scalp?”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">There were sometimes things more to be dreaded than Indians. In July of that year, just when the new crops began looking most promising, grasshoppers came in clouds so thick as to darken the air. They ate everything green and growing in their paths. They were particularly bad in Sanpete Valley for a period of two or three weeks. Men, women and children were called out every day en masse to fight with shovels, brooms, switches, aprons - anything they could wield to try and kill them or drive them away. When the ‘hoppers were finally gone there was little left of the crops. A food shortage was bound to follow. But pigweeds grew profusely near Temple Hill and dandelions too - both made tasty nourishing greens. Young milkweed stalks seemed as good creamed as asparagus. Dainty Sego Lillies, called “Lanterns of the Fairies” by the pioneers, grew quite abundantly on the foothills near Manti. Their bulbs could be dug up and eaten raw, cooked, or ground into meal for bread making. All these helped out many a dire food situation in those early days</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If Else was worried, fretful, and not quite her sweet, courageous self that summer and fall of 1867, she had some reason to be for she was expecting a little one. Anne was expecting also and both were hoping for sons, as were their respective husbands. Christen especially wanted a son, which was quite understandable with so many girls in his household already. The two women spun and sewed and made little quilts and garments together and talked of their coming confinements; neither knowing which would be first. Anne, though older, was as unaccustomed to childbirth as Else; to both of them it was a mystery <span id="page-229"></span> fathomed only by the experienced. As their times drew nearer a midwife was approached and spoken for. In the meantime the fathers-to-be doubtless fashioned small wooden cradles and dreamed betimes of their unborn sons. Maren had consented to do the cooking and extras for the two households besides looking after her three young sisters, while Anne was lying-in, although she and Lars Myrup had hoped to go north with the Conference goers that October to see the magnificent new Tabernacle in which the meetings were to be held for the first time. It was to be a glorious occasion. Everyone said the new structure, 250 feet long, 150 feet wide and 68 feet from floor to ceiling, with its immense roof arched without a pillar, and its great pipe organ, was one of the wonders of the world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sat. 28 Sept. 1867, Christen and Anne’s child was born, a healthy baby girl whom they decided to name Caroline. This was Christen’s eleventh child and seventh daughter but only Anne’s first. Six days later, 4th of Oct., in another one-roomed log cabin within the confines of the Big Fort in Manti, Else presented Laurs with a curly-haired son. Why Laurs got the son and his father another daughter ‘tis hard to tell. Perhaps he remembered to sleep with an ax under his bed while Christen forgot. It should be comparatively easy to remember the date of the little boy’s birth, since it was just two days before the October General Conference convened in Salt Lake City, at which time the new Tabernacle was dedicated, 6 Oct. 1867. Laurs and Else decided to name their boy Christian. Baby Christian was undoubtedly given his name and blessing on Fast Sunday in November at a meeting in the Council House on the Tabernacle Block. Petrine Christensen was likely confirmed there also following her baptism, since she turned eight in Manti that year of 1867.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At General Conference in Salt Lake City that October, other business besides the dedication of the new Tabernacle was taken care of: 163 missionaries were called to strengthen the settlements in southern Utah, and all the Saints in Zion were called upon to assist liberally the following <span id="page-230"></span>year towards emigrating all the poor Saints from Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries. No church teams had been sent to the Missouri River for the poor that year, because of the Indian trouble, in consequence of which the immigration of members to Zion was comparatively small. Anne was anxious to send money to her sister in Denmark so that she might come, and Christen promised to get around to it as soon as he got his feet on his own ground. Lars Myrup too was eager to have his father and step-mother and their children come; but it turned out to be many years before this was accomplished. Else’s thoughts must also have turned to her people in Jutland. But it was useless to think of them in connection with the church, or any other way now for that matter. Not until she could tell of something besides poverty and hardships would she even bother to write them, for she was proud and they would be slow to understand such things. Yet the call of home reached out to her in voices unstilled by time and space.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was known that Chief Black Hawk, who had gained for himself the title of the “Red Marauder”, had been gravely wounded at the battle of Gravelly Ford in June 1866 but it was rumored that more recently he had contracted tuberculosis and in his weakened condition was loath to continue the hard life he had been pursuing. In the fall of 1867 he indicated he wanted to make peace. At a meeting with Colonel Head, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the Uintah Indian reservation, he unbosomed himself, again expressed a desire for peace and asked Superintendent Head to cut his hair for him in token of his abandonment of the warpath, and promised to induce as many as possible of his adherents to join him in peace. Preliminaries having been accomplished, the proud Chieftain seemed anxious to make amends to the people of Utah before death overtook him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus, on April 5, 1868, believing Indian hostilities were over and that it was safe to return to their deserted homes, a company of 22 men, 4 boys and 15 wagons started on their way to re-open the settlement of Monroe in Sevier County. They had been cautioned against possible Indian attacks <span id="page-231"></span>however. Early in the afternoon they found they were being followed by Indians, so immediately corraled their animals to prevent a stampede and prepared for the worst. The Indians dismounted and took to the cedars which formed a kind of horseshoe bend around the place. From this point they fired upon the company, killing Lars A. Justesen, a Danish emigrant. After two hours of fighting the Indians returned to the hillside. Riders were sent out to Gunnison and Richfield for help but the Indians pursued them and succeeded in severely wounding Adolph Thomson. When word reached Gunnison a party of twenty-nine men went immediately to their assistance. They also came upon the body of Charles Wilson, who had been murdered by the Indians near the scene of the other attack.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So in spite of Black Hawk the war continued, although the renegade Indians who kept at it in Sanpete and Sevier did not make as many attacks as the previous years. The energy and vigilance of the militia had their effects upon these wily foe and they saw their prospects of raids in safety and success fading. But accustomed as they were by now to feasting on the cattle of the settlers, many grew fretful at having to stay within the safe limits of their strongholds subsisting on crickets, grasshoppers and an occasional game animal. So some continued their raids - safe or not. Especially the young chiefs and sub-chieftains were rebellious and defiant and boasted not a little of their prowess and deeds of blood. These young warriors were loath to “bury the tomahawk” or eat humble pie by creeping back into the good graces of Uncle Sam and the settlers as Chief Black Hawk had done. Also, in the south, north and east, the Shiberetch, Capotah and Elk Mountain Indian bands, as well as the turbulent, Navajos, were still on the warpath and troops were kept on scouting expeditions against them. All in all the Indians continued to make things sufficiently distressing for the settlers most of the year 1868.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was a strange paradox that while the settlers continued their war against the redmen on the one hand, they were earnestly laboring to <span id="page-232"></span>make peace with them on the other. Treaties were signed with various Indian leaders here and there, even though they continued to be broken by the redmen and perhaps some whites. Yet progress towards peace in the valleys was being made notwithstanding. One of the most important treaty meetings for the people of Sanpete, save the one with Chief Black Hawk the year before, was held in Strawberry Valley, Uinta Co. in August 1868. Here Superintendent F. H. Head again met with Black Hawk, but this time the Chief had a number of his sub-chiefs with him. They had a “heap big talk” which lasted nearly all one day. The talk ended in the signing of a peace treaty by the whites and Chiefs Augavorum (the White Horse Chief) Tamarita and Sowahpoint and a few others, urged on by Black Hawk.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Sanpete at Ephraim a few days later, negotiations were continued and details of the peace worked out. In attendance in the town’s bowery were the above named chieftains as well as Black Hawk, numerous young Indian braves and quite a group of white settlers. The fact that some of the redmen came with their faces painted black, war clubs slung on their wrists and pistols hidden under their blankets lent a rather eerie effect to the scene. Apostle Orson Hyde, an emmissary of peace for the Church, presided and the boastful, insolent White Horse Chief acted as spokesman for his red brethren. In eloquent defiance and with much disdain he made his accusations and demands, often with contemptuous gestures, but the whites refused to be ruffled. At length their cool diplomacy, together with Black Hawk’s encouragement, overcame the resistance of the assembled Indians. At last the party moved to a nearby lawn where the Indians seated themselves in a circle and passed around the pipe of peace. Hundreds of dollars worth of blankets, gay calico, tobacco, trinkets and other articles were distributed to the eager Utes as the price of peace. Thus the treaty was concluded and comparative quiet settled upon the valley.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-233"></span>The Christensens had been looking forward to October General Conference that year. It was to be quite an occasion for Christen and Anne as they planned to have their endowments and be sealed to one another for time and eternity in the Salt Lake Endowment House while in the city. Maren and Lars Myrup had been thinking about it also, but again they were deprived of going because they had a tiny daughter of their own and were loath to leave her in another’s care. The little girl had been born five weeks following her mother’s nineteenth birthday, 22 Mar. 1868, in the Myrup’s log cabin in the Big Fort. They had taken her to Fast Meeting in the Council House for her blessing and given her the name of Mary, the American name for Maren. It is doubtful if Laurs and Else went along that year either, with young Christen just a year old and crawling into everything. They must have cared for little Caroline also, to leave Anne and Christen free, and probably helped with the girls too, since Maren must have had her hands full with little Mary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen and Anne went to Salt Lake by covered wagon, along with a company of other Conference-goers. You may be sure they had an armed escort along, as skirmishes, stock thefts and even killings continued, even after the treaties were signed. Though there was supposed to be peace, no wise settlers ever traveled about unprotected; it didn’t pay to take the chance. The company left Manti early since it still took almost a week to get from there to Salt Lake City. On Sat. Oct. 5th, in the Endowment House, Christen and Anne were given their endowments and sealed to each other. The gentle Karen, Christen’s first wife, was also sealed to him for eternity, although her endowments had to be postponed until a temple was erected in Zion in which to do work for the dead. General Conference convened next day, Oct. 6th, in the new Tabernacle and lasted three days. It was the first time a full quorum of Apostles was ever present at a Conference in Utah. Apostles Franklin D. Richards and Charles W. Penrose having just arrived in Salt Lake from their foreign missions. It is likely that Brother <span id="page-234"></span>Penrose’s hymn “O Ye Mountains High” was featured at this Conference.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If April Conference the following year, 1869, was considered by Laurs and Else, the idea came to nothing since Else was expecting again and too near the time to take a chance on so long a journey. On June 6 that year she gave birth to another fine son. He too was born in their log cabin home in the Big Fort at Manti; for though some people were now moving out of the fort and building homes on their own adjoining farms, yet a number of the Scandinavians planned to move on farther south as soon as Indian troubles became a bit more settled, and among these were the Christensens. So they remained on in the Big Fort for awhile longer. This baby must also have been christened in the Council House at Manti. He was given the name of Andrew, American for Anders, after Else’s father. Can’t we just see Else cuddling the wee one, as twenty-months-old Christian clung to her skirts, vying for attention?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Andrew was born just twenty-one days following the laying of the last rail and driving of the last spike (gold) that joined the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, completing the Great Pacific Railroad into Utah. This long hoped for event took place at Promontory Point near Ogden, 10 May 1869. No more were church wagon trains sent east to the big rivers to bring in the immigrating Saints since they could now come all-the-way-to-Zion-in-comfort (or so ‘twas advertised). Right away ground was broken for the start of the Utah Central Railway, a branch road to be built from Ogden to Salt Lake City. Later on other railway systems, including the Utah Southern Railroad, Denver and Rio Grande, etc., were built to other parts of the Territory. Numbers of the settlers were given employment on these projects as time went on, helping them to supplement their incomes and giving them other means with which to barter and trade, besides their livestock and farm produce. Thus the coming of the railroad to Utah brought prosperity along with it, and “business began to boom”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet things were anything but “booming” for <span id="page-235"></span>the Christensens, Myrups and some others of the Scandinavian immigrants then living in Manti, for they had not yet become firmly settled in Zion. These were still waiting for the cessation of Indian troubles, or at least for the time when they themselves could feel safe in moving farther south and taking up land. Skirmishes, stock thefts, and even killings had gone on. Even as late as 26 Sept. 1872, when Daniel Miller was killed and his son Dan Jr, wounded near Bernard Snow’s mill not far from Spring City, Sanpete County, where the two had gone for lumber, were the Indians still to be feared. Though this incident was considered by some to be the finale of the Black Hawk Indian War, it was well nigh impossible to tell just when this war really ended.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It had been a costly one for the young Territory. It was estimated that, counting the loss of livestock, expense of military supplies and services, as well as the breaking up and re-establishing of numerous settlements, the cost had run to more than one-and-a-half million dollars during the four years 1865-1869. Looking back on it, some concluded that a bale of blankets and a few sacks of flour here and there, distributed to the redmen in the proper season, might have accomplished more than their weight in gold expended in military operations. Would the people then never learn about the ways of peace and war? However, these early settlers learned teamwork and cooperation through it all. There were many fine examples of sacrificial giving which helped to unite these people in a bond of brotherhood and common ideals.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The last incidents of this destructive war were carried out by renegade Indians and in no way involved Chief Black Hawk. When he signed the peace treaty and persuaded his sub-chiefs and braves to do likewise, he was determined to have no more to do with war and the killing of whites, and he stuck to it. To prove this he decided to visit every town and settlement where his warriors had caused trouble or raided, in an effort to “make peace with the people”. So he obtained permission from the proper authorities to do this. <span id="page-236"></span>Thus, sometime before his death, with a few of his warriors and a military escort, the notorious Black Hawk visited every town and village from Cedar City on the south to Payson on the north, in an attempt to make peace with the whites and win their forgiveness. A revealing account has been given of his visit to Fillmore, in Millard County, the latter part of April 1870, when he appeared at a Sunday meeting before a highly expectant audience”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“With head erect and dignified steps, as unperturbed as a white General, Black Hawk, preceeded by the Bishop, marched to the platform and was seated. After preliminary exercises he was introduced and the object of his presence stated. Personified dignity in every movement and gesture, the Pah-Ute Chief deliberately arose and avoiding the pulpit, stood on the side of the platform near his interpreter and spoke exclusively in Pah-Ute, although he could speak English quite well. The slowly dying chieftain rapidly rehearsed the story of his early grievances: — how the white invaders had taken possession of the hunting and fishing grounds of his ancestors; of the insolence of some of the white men and of the whipping and occasional killing of some of his warriors. The speaker seemed to have few regrets for his raids in Sanpete and Sevier. He denied complicity in some of the murders of which he had been accused and expressed sorrow over others, saying that the raids were forced by the starvation of his people and that, had he been so inclined, every white man, woman and child could have been massacred. He concluded his speech with a not too repentant plea for forgiveness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Bishop then moved a vote of forgiveness of their late enemy, who was preparing to meet the ‘Great Spirit’, and requested that the audience express their views. On the stand was the father-in-law of Samuel Brown who, together with Bishop Josiah Call, had been murdered in the late ‘50’s by Indians. He broke the suspense by speaking briefly against the motion. Then suddenly, turning on the redman, he shouted, ‘You black murderer, you killed Bishop Call, the best friend the Indians <span id="page-237"></span>ever had, and you murdered Sam Brown for the money he was carrying - you black devil! I will NOT forgive you.’ But to this the once dreaded Chieftain never ‘batted an eye’. A voice vote was then taken - one grim ‘NO’ and the Chieftain once known as ‘The Red Marauder’ was absolved from mortal responsibility for his active belief in the ancient law ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It has been said that at his best Black Hawk was a fine looking Chief, his appearance being different from that of the other chiefs. He was tall and wore long feathers. His nose was long and he wore a small moustache and looked as if he had Jewish blood in him. He also had three nice looking squaws. But Black Hawk was not at his best physically during the last years of his life. It must be remembered that he had been wounded in battle in 1866 and that tuberculosis had set in sometime after and was taking its toll. He knew that it wouldn’t be too long before he would be going home to die, and before the end came he desired to be at peace with the pale faces. The proud Black Hawk’s repentance may have been brought about by his weakening condition, but on the other hand it may have been forced by mental anguish. As he began losing his health and strength, the once powerful Indian must have recalled again and again a long-gone meeting with the “Great White Chief” Brigham Young, to which he had been summoned in an attempt to get him to walk the ways of peace. In surly contempt he had paid the Mormon leader no heed, even after he had leveled his finger at him and uttered these prophetic words;— “If you continue to shed the blood of Mormons you shall wither and die!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">No one can tell the exact date that Black Hawk went home to his wigwam and gave up his life to join his fathers and the Great Spirit in a better land. Nor can anyone now living tell just when he was buried in his Spring Lake Villa south of Payson in Utah County. But before he died he became a living skeleton, having wasted away to almost nothing. He knew it was because he had killed the white men. That he was a red man of <span id="page-238"></span>some courage cannot be denied, and begging forgiveness of the whites, or “eating humble pie” as the Indians called it, undoubtedly took as much courage as all the battles he had ever fought put together. Lightly flint-tipped arrows, heavily feathered for long range shooting, heavily-tipped, lightly feathered ones for short range, and sometimes poisoned arrows tipped with venom from the fangs of the rattlesnake, were among Chief Black Hawk’s earthly weapons; but in the land of the “Happy Hunting Ground” — who knows…?</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">As the year 1869 drew to a close in Manti the big drums seldom beat out warnings anymore and the Indian warwhoops had mostly ceased; but the sensations connected with those beating drums and blood-curdling yells must have lived with the settlers the remainder of their lives. For the majority of the Utah pioneers the 1,100 mile trek from the Missouri River had not been too unpleasant, with some exceptions such as the Abner Lowry Company. Solving the problems of settlement and establishing home in an unconquered wilderness was the really great challenge - the supreme test of their ability and integrity. To stop in the middle of settling and fight an Indian war had been demanding. Three thousand young men had been on call for military duty and served without pay. Those who stayed at home had furnished food, weapons, ammunition, horses, saddles and other equipment. Muster rolls and other expenditures had been compiled, for it was expected that the national government would reimburse the settlers for the time and money spent, but it did not. The one-and-a-half million dollar cost of the war was largely met by individual sacrifice. Even the smaller settlements were allotted their share of the expense plus what they suffered in loss of cattle and horses. Thus for some time many were in an impoverished condition. The need for sharing worldly goods was not over until well after the war.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christensens and Myrups, intent upon moving to a less crowded area, had their hearts set on Gunnison, approximately fifteen miles southwest of Manti.

It was virtually believed that Indian raiding and killing were over, at least while the winter snow barricaded the canyons, keeping the redmen out of the valleys. Preparations were gotten underway in their various households but there was one thing more that they were awaiting before they left Manti. This event took place on the eve of Christmas, 24 Dec. 1869, when Anne presented Christen with a long-awaited son. It was quite natural that they should choose the name of Christen for this new child, in honor of his father but perhaps also in memory of the other son Christen who had stayed behind in Old Denmark.</p>
