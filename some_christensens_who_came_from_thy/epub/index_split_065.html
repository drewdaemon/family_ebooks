  <p class="calibre1">(19) Wendell Bartholomew Christensen (2) sent his interesting history in installments, we could hardly wait for the next mail. Here it is: “I was born 26 Oct. 1903 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah in the same house my mother, Sarah, had been born twenty-eight years before. Descendants of the builder, my grandfather John Bartholomew, still occupy the place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One of my earliest recollections was a trip to Europe at age six-and-a-half. Father took a leave of absence from his school work in Salt Lake City to study in England, France and Germany, and took the whole family along. I started school at Leipzig, Germany and soon felt at home with the German children. When we returned to America in 1911 we settled in Provo, Utah, where Father was appointed head of the Language and Archeological depts. at BYU. Edythe and I were placed in the BYU Training School. Here I was baptized a member of the church, 21 June 1912, by Willard F. Russell and confirmed the same day by Reed Beck.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“From Provo we moved to Rexburg, Idaho, where father had been appointed President of Ricks Junior College. Here I first received the priesthood, being ordained 26 Nov. 1916 by L.T. Perry. I also received a patriarchal blessing which has been a great source of encouragement and guidance all my life. From Idaho we moved to LaVerkin in Utah’s ‘Dixie’ where we spent some eventful years developing a hot springs resort and trying to start <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-748" title="748"></span>an irrigation project to water several thousand acres of what could have been wonderfully productive land. It failed at that time but was just recently approved by the U.S. Government after a wait of about fifty years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“From Dixie we moved to Hinkley, Utah, where Father answered a call by the church to organize the Millard Academy into a junior college. About this time the church decided to abandon the church school system with the exception of BYU and Weber and LDS Colleges. So father left the teaching profession for business and ranching. He acquired the Star Ranch with his brother Albert and brother-in-law Otis Ursenbrach and later bought a cattle ranch near Duchesne, Utah. My days as a ranch hand and farmer lasted until the farm depression in 1923 when financial reverses caused the loss of the ranches and the family moved to Salt Lake, where father went into business promoting his various mining and metals interests and we older children got jobs. I spent several years in mining, first in Farmington, Utah, and later in California.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was while living in Salt Lake and going to school at the U of U that I first met Ann Howells, a popular member of our Ward’s younger set. We were in an MIA play together and our friendship blossomed into love. I was called on a mission to Germany in 1925 and after my farewell party in the Ward, I sat on the church porch with Ann while the church almost burned down. A thief had broken into the chapel hoping to find the money donated for my mission expenses and had dropped a match which started the blaze. Ann and I corresponded while I was in Germany and shortly after my return we became engaged.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My mission in Germany was a wonderful experience. Because of my earlier trip there I learned the language easily and was blessed with some fine missionary companions. I labored first in Dresden, a beautiful city rich in tradition and culture, where I met many faithful, warm and friendly people and learned to love them like my own family. Later I was sent to Breslau as District President and it was here that I had a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-749" title="749"></span>remarkable experience. The mission president had called a conference for the whole mission, to be held in Dresden, a distance of about three hundred and twelve miles from Breslau. It was suggested that the Elders from each District walk the whole distance and tract and preach the gospel on the way. We were all excited at the prospects, but two weeks before the conference it started to rain and rain and rain without let up. All over Germany the crops were being ruined and things were developing into a national emergency. The mission president sent word that we should give up the idea of walking unless things changed well in advance of the date. Those in our District met together, prayed and discussed the problem, deciding that if the Lord wanted us to do his work the way would be opened. We also decided that we would fast the day before our departure, then meet the next day for our final prayers and take our separate courses two by two. There were sixteen of us, making eight different groups.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When the final morning arrived it was raining hard and the skies were leaden; the papers predicted more rain. Undaunted, we met at the appointed place with our knapsacks filled with gospel tracts, heavy soles on our shoes, and prepared to depend on the hospitality of the German people during our three hundred mile walking tour. We sang a song and prayed together, asking the Lord to clear the skies. A few words of encouragement were given and we went downstairs and out into the street. The rain had stopped and patches of blue sky appeared among the clouds. For two weeks we walked under warm, blue skies and were welcomed by farmers and villagers who had been thoroughly humbled by prospects of lost crops. As one hundred sixty footsore missionaries arrived in Dresden to commence a three day conference and testimony meetings the skies suddenly darkened and it began to rain again. I have never heard more wonderful testimonies than those given by these Elders relating their experiences - some really miraculous. Meetings lasting ten hours each passed without notice; we wondered where the time went. Sheldon had been called to Germany on a mission a year after I left and I had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-750" title="750"></span>the privilege of being his first district president.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When I returned home our family was having financial problems. Finances for both Sheldon and my missions had been mostly earned by mother from sewing burial clothes in partnership with another sister of the Ward. Her sacrifices and labor will always be remembered with gratitude and love. This was March 1928 and I left shortly after for Los Angeles, Calif. to help father with his mining projects. These ventures were not successful and in June 1929 I returned to Salt Lake to marry Ann and then moved with her back to Los Angeles, where we began keeping house in a small apartment on Portland street.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was unable to support a wife working for Father and soon set out on my own. I got a job selling Christmas cards until the holidays ended and then tried selling real estate. I did fairly well but was unhappy with the people for whom I worked and finally got a job with the Standard Oil Company as a fireman at their El Segundo plant. I remained with Standard Oil for most of a year, receiving some promotion and saving some money, but the depression of 1929-1933 had already hurt the oil business and Standard suddenly laid off 2500 men, including myself. By searching the papers I found a selling job with the Club Aluminum Co. demonstrating and selling cooking utensils.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I began to realize that I was not paying my tithing. Money from commissions came in a few dollars at a time and was spent as it was received. I placed a small canvas banksack in the pocket of the car and if I earned ten dollars, one dollar went into the sack. At the end of the week I would pay the money to the Bishop. From that time forward we began to prosper and receive guidance and blessings. All during the depression years we had work and an income.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was called to be Superintendent of the Wilshire Ward Sunday School, which at the time was the largest Ward in the church, with over 3200 members. After a year I was called into the office of President Cannon of the Los Angeles Stake and told that I had been chosen as Bishop of the Santa <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-751" title="751"></span>Monica Ward. I had just turned thirty-one, had never seen the Santa Monica Ward and did not know any of the people. When I told my wife she thought it was a joke. However, we accepted the call and moved to Santa Monica. I served for a month without selecting my assistants in order to become better acquainted with the people, but finally made my selection of Counselors and, by special per- mission, chose one of the sisters as Ward Clerk. It was a fine experience and we made many wonderful and lasting friends. One of my first official acts as Bishop was to perform the marriage ceremony for my brother Luther and his sweetheart Velda Peterson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1936 my company transfered me to Long Beach as branch manager of the office but I continued to serve as Bishop in Santa Monica for almost a year after, traveling back and forth for all meetings, rain or shine. We carried our baby, Bart, in the car with us and he was always smiles day or night. I was finally released and then called as counselor to Bishop Henry Carlson of the Pine View Ward in Long Beach, where I served until we returned to Los Angeles in 1939. I had just been made the regional manager of the Century Metalcraft Corporation over all of southern California. I gained a strong testimony of the way the Lord blesses us if we try to serve him. I had been told many times by my boss that if I would only spend less time in church work and use Sundays for making sales I would go far with the company. However, he was made vice-president of the company and transferred to Chicago and I was given his job in Los Angeles and we became one of the leading offices in the country with more than one hundred salesmen. When the Second World War started President Roosevelt issued a direction withdrawing all metals from private business use, except by special priority. Our business, being what was considered a non-essential industry, was soon doomed. I bought and stored all the aluminum cooking utensils I could from the factory in Los Angeles, but after six months of hopeful struggle we had to announce to our sales force that the end had come and to look for other work in the defense plants. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-752" title="752"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“By this time I had a wife and two growing sons and we were soon blessed with twin daughters. I felt that I must now find a business that could not be damaged by changing conditions. I decided to apply to the Occidental Life Insurance Company where my brother Sheldon was then employed. This was in November 1942. I was accepted and soon trained and under way; the choice turned out to be a wise and profitable one. Early in 1944 my manager was sent to San Francisco as branch manager there and soon wrote and asked me to come north to be his assistant. Ann and I went to the Bay City to look things over and were impressed, so I accepted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I moved to San Francisco first, intending to find a place for my family, but every available place was reserved for war workers. We were invited to live with first one family of friends and then another, until I finally got permission from the government to build a house, and the Occidental Life Insurance Company agreed to advance the needed money to purchase a lot and needed materials. Ann and the children were sent to Salt Lake City to live with her mother, now a widow, while the house was under construction. It was expected to be finished within sixty to ninety days, but because of the war and difficulty in getting materials, it took more than nine months. This was a period of strain, especially for Ann, but finally the house was finished in time for us to move in for Thanksgiving 1946. It was a real Thanksgiving for us. We were together again and in a home of our own, and our business was prospering. The Lord had been very kind and blessed us abundantly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The year before, 1945, my boss had decided to move back to Los Angeles and, after some discussion at the home office, I was given his position in San Francisco. At first I was placed on salary with the title of “Acting Manager” but after one year was given the full title of Branch Manager and an overwriting on all the business produced by the office. We prospered and built the business to a production of over $20,000,000 per year. Yes, we were blessed in many ways!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was called to be the Stake Superintendent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-753" title="753"></span>of the Sunday School in the newly created Palo Alto Stake and then, after a year, as second counselor to Stake President Claud B. Peterson. About a year later he was called to Salt Lake to be secretary to the Quorum of the Twelve. His first counselor was made Stake President and I became first counselor. When the new Stake President, Brother Henry Jorgenson, was sent to Florida to head the church Welfare farm there, I was set apart as Stake President of Palo Alto Stake by Elder Stephen L. Richards, 30 Apr. 1950.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was released as stake president in 1953 and shortly thereafter left Occidental Life to go into business for myself. I took a general agency with Beneficial Standard Life Insurance Co. of Los Angeles, and in 1956 made an additional connection with Financial Fund of Denver, Colorado. Since then I have continued in the business of estate programming, using life insurance and mutual funds, increasing our operational scope and adding and training new salesmen. We changed our dealer connection from Financial Industrial Fund to Kelly and Morey, Inc. of Denver in Feb. 1966. In May 1967 we merged with the Equity Funding Corporation of Los Angeles, and I became vice president and Divisional Sales Manager of the San Francisco area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have known the healing power of the priesthood. In 1948 when we were landscaping our backyard I was operating a rototiller, a powerful machine with a series of spring steel hooks which rotated under a heavy steel cover. In attempting to turn a corner I put one foot forward to brace myself and one of the hooks caught the roll in my Levis and my leg was drawn under the hood and through the hooks until the leg, from ankle to, thigh, was hanging in shreds. I was rushed to the hospital and the doctors worked all night cleaning, cutting and sewing over 300 stitches. They had little hope of saving my leg. As soon as possible Presidents Peterson and Jorgensen came and administered to me and in two weeks I was up and starting to walk. It took time but as the months passed the pain left, the leg took on a normal shape and the feeling began to return. Today the scars have almost disappeared and the leg is equal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-754" title="754"></span>in every way to my other - a miracle!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During these last years I have served in the church as a Seminary teacher six years, as Seminary Stake Coordinator three years, the last year supervising the Seminaries of both San Mateo and San Francisco Stakes. I am also serving as a member of the San Mateo High Council, and as such acting as advisor to the 458th Quorum of Seventies, the Stake Mission and Educational advisor. We have seen the church in this area grow and prosper. When our Stake was first divided from San Francisco in 1945, there were only some 2,200 members living in the area from South San Francisco to Monterey which was then a Mission. The only chapels were in Palo Alto and San Jose and they were small and inadequate. At this date, 1967, there are five Stakes with about 30,000 members and beautiful chapels dot the whole area. We were privileged to attend the dedication of the beautiful Oakland Temple and hear the Prophet David O. McKay set it apart as a house of the Lord for the performance of the sacred and eternal ordinances.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We have been wonderfully blessed as a family. Our children are all successfully and happily married. Ann and I are rather enjoying the quiet of the home with all of them gone but we can hardly wait for each opportunity to visit their families and hope that the coming years will bring a great increase in our posterity. We have been blessed with wonderful health and in times of trial and stress we have been strengthened and comforted. We are both deeply grateful for our wonderful parents, brothers and sisters, and all the far-flung branches of our families, and for the love that binds us together.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our testimonies have been strengthened with the years as we have seen the guiding hand of the Lord in all that we have done. Time and space will not allow me to relate a hundredth part of the blessings which He has poured forth upon us and our families. We can only express our gratitude and bear witness that He lives, that He hears and answers prayers, that He is merciful, kind and forgiving. We pray that we may serve Him all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-755" title="755"></span>the days of our lives and that our posterity will be true and faithful members of His church and kingdom forever.”</p>
