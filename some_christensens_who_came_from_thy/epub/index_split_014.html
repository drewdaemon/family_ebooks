  <h2 class="calibre9" id="norhaa-1852-1862">NØRHAA … 1852-1862</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The Priest in the Parish and town of Nørhaa welcomed farmer Anders Christensen and his family and entered them on the records, 29 March 1852, in the following Danish words: Familien er 29 Marts 1852 flyttet til Nørhaa Sogn. Her er naevnt: Gaardmand Anders Christensen 43 aar gl., hans Kone Mette Kristine Christensdatter 40 aar gl., Aftaegtskone Karen Andersdatter 78 aar gl. Deres børn: Karen Andersen 8 aar gl., Mads Christian Andersen 7 aar gl., Else Cathrine Andersen 5 aar gl., Ane Kirstine Andersen 3 aar gl. So Else’s family moved to a better farm in Nørhaa when she was just a month and three weeks past five, Her sister Karen <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-75" title="75"></span> had just turned eight the 18th of March that year and Mads had his seventh festival just ten days before, on the 19th of March, the day after Karen’s birthday. Their old grandmother Karen, now 78, was with them but their half-brother Christen was not. He perhaps remained in Kjallerup working for someone, since he was then just turned 13, or he may have been with Mette’s parents down in Svindborg. Anders had come to their new farm before the planting season was over, so he would plough after all that spring; and Mette was in her nicer cottage in plenty of good time to welcome the new baby there in Nørhaa, 22 Aug. 1852. And guess what — it was a bouncing, plump baby girl whom they christened Sidsel Marie and called Marie. Her hjemmedøbt (home baptism) was recorded as 24 Aug. 1852 and her fremstillingen i Kirken (recognition of the same in the church) 10 Oct. 1852, all in their new Parish church in Nørhaa.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Young Karen, dark haired and small of stature, started school for the first time the late fall of 1852, in the schoolhouse close to the white church at Nørhaa, for she was now eight years old. The young students who went clogging along in their wooden shoes through mud and snow, removed them upon entering the school room and placed them in individual cubby-holes, assigned to each for that purpose, before donning soft handmade slippers instead. The school classes in these farming towns and villages usually lasted for about six months each year, from after-harvest in October to before-planting in April; children were needed on the farms between times. One teacher for each two grades was the general rule, with a supervisor, and a sort of school council or board made up of citizens. Of course the Parish Priest was the general supervisor, over all, and often looked in and listened in at the school, questioning the pupils, especially at examination times. Here in these free Church and State schools young Danes learned to read and write and were tutored in the literature, history and geography of their own land. Girls were instructed in the home-making arts and learned to hand-sew, embroider, knit and crochet; while boys were given training in agriculture, care of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-76" title="76"></span> farm animals, etc., and also sports competition. The Danes in general were great admirers of athletic ability and both boys and girls were given gymnastic training. Religious study was had too, and catechisms were a regular part of the school program. Each Danish child was to attend school until age 12 or 14 unless circumstances dictated otherwise, which was sometimes the case among the poorer peasant families. The winter nearest to a child’s fourteenth birthday (before or after) he or she was sent twice a week, for the full six months, to the Priest’s house or Parsonage near the school, to be taught the fundamentals of the Lutheran Church by the Priest himself. This was in preparation for his or her first communion and confirmation. These important occasions were nearly always held at the close of the school year in April and looked forward to with great anticipation by every Danish child; for after Confirmation one was considered to be an “adult”, as it were, and allowed adult privileges. Young Christen had joined his mother’s family in time for school that fall, for he would be 14 the following March and in line for confirmation in April.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Old Karen was feeble now and had taken to her bed, but Mette cared for Anders’ mother tenderly, in spite of the new baby and all. This was an obligation willingly assumed by all upright Danes; to care well for their aged progenitors and show them love and give them thanks while there yet remained the time for giving — thanks for the fact that. through them they themselves now lived and knew the boundless joy there was in living! This one characteristic alone set the Danish above people of many other lands; kinship and heredity were sacred and important to them. January 26th 1853 old Karen passed on, she would have had her 80th festival in less than two more months, for she was born 12 April 1773. Her grandchildren were sad at the loss of dear Bedstemoder, for she was kind to them and had been in the home from their first memories. Anders was sorely grieved, though perhaps it was better than a long suffering; but he knew so little of what was held out for her on the other side of the grave. Would he ever see her again? He longed to take her corpse to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-77" title="77"></span> Hvidbjerg churchyard to lay down by his father, old Christen, but because of the winter weather and bad roads it seemed impossible. So arrangements were made with the Priest in the Parish there at Nørhaa for her funeral and proper burial or “dirt casting” (jordpaakastelsen). The Priest preached a good funeral sermon over the old one as her casket lay in front of him near the pulpit of the white church and then, as they carried her coffin outside, the large bell in the belfry began to toll for her and continued until her casket had been lowered into the grave-hole. Then the Priest took his place beside the hole and cast in a little of the sacred dirt (which he had blessed) which made a sad little thud upon the wooden casket down below as he raised his hand to heaven with the words, “From earth you came; to earth you return; and from earth you shall come again — Amen”, and this benediction was the signal for the plain dirt to be shoveled into the gaping hole, while the black clothed and hatted mourners stood weeping all around. No sound could be happier than bells, no sound could be sadder. And thus Karen Andersdatter went to her rest and her reward, and it was said by some that there was a hovering of all her ancestors over the land then; for so it was believed to be when one of the old Danes died.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Young Christen did receive his confirmation that spring of 1853, at the Parish church in Nørhaa, for so the record there proclaims. It is likely that he received his Little Black Book (Skudsmaalsbog) about the same time also, but it would be difficult for him to move around much anyway till he was 39, because he was of military age now soon and must be available if the King wanted him in his army. He could give Anders some help on the new farm. Young Mads started school that late autumn, 1853. He had been a great help to his father, gathering and carrying in wood, and water from the well; taking the cows to the meadow pasture, with the aid of his little, yapping dog; feeding the pigs and other farm animals; and with planting, weeding and harvesting. One never had to worry about watering the crops in Jutland for the “Great <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-78" title="78"></span> Provider” took care of that there, as he did elsewhere in Denmark; the concern was for enough dry days. God put the sun in the heavens, sent the rain and provided the earth, but peasants had to plant and sow - ja! Yes, evena child’s ten fingers could be a great help on a farm and in a house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else too was a fine, strong child with a willingness to serve. She could gather eggs, carry small pails of grain to feed chickens and geese, bring in vegetables from the garden, pick clean the wool her father sheared and her mother corded for quilts or spun into yarn for knitting or loom weaving, and numbers of other small tasks both in and out the cottage. Mette sought her second daughter’s help often, because of her cheerfulness and ability, for she herself was crowded with work from early morning until after nightfall. Else wondered at her mother’s magic touch with butter and cheese, red-mush, sweet-soup, frikadeller, bed med log, little fried and sugared apple cakes (aebleskiver) Danish soup and dumplings and Danish homemade beer, etc. Someday she herself would learn to cook like Mor, and spin and weave and knit stockings of all sizes and mittens, and make high feather beds. Right now she liked to tend her baby sister most of all; when the older children were in school she had Marie mostly to herself and this pleased her and Mor too. Marie was rolly-polly and slow to learn but Else loved her just the same as she did her other young sister, Stine, who was so often sick in winter. In truth, Else loved all her family, her kith and kin and everybody, for she was a happy, generous, loveable person. Though not as pretty as dainty Karen or fragile Stine, or yet in fact as plump Marie, still she was well put together and very intelligent looking, with a high forehead, well proportioned nose and other excellent features, but she had the most beautiful hair of all! It fell to her waist in heavy cascades the color of dark burnished amber, as if it had been freshly dipped in liquid Danish “sea-gold”. Many of their kinsfolk had “red hair”; even Mads’ and Stine’s was turned toward that shade; but Else’s hair could not be called red, or yet brown — it was more the color of shining “Danish amber”, so let it go at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-79" title="79"></span> that! Mostly she wore her lovely tresses in two full, round braids hanging down her back. When she became confirmed she could wear them as she chose; perhaps she would wind them into a braided crown upon her head, like Mor’s.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most likely Else Cathrine started to school the October before she was 8, as was often the practice if parents desired it. Mette was especially concerned for the education of her children and would most probably have seen to it. Else herself must have been anxious and proud to clop along to the schoolhouse in her wooden shoes that winter of 1854/55, along with Karen and Mads. As a caution against the cold she would have worn besides, long hand knitted woolen stockings well up over her knees, and a half-sleeved shimmy and flannel-lined bloomers under a heavy, long-sleeved wool dress, with coat, cap, mittens and a shawl. One had to bundle up in winters in Jutland. That this child’s interests in school ran to the reading, writing and language skills and other academic pursuits rather than to handicrafts, can be easily imagined; although she must have learned all that was necessary of the homemaking arts as well. Karen was just the opposite; she liked the sewing and other home arts best, while Mads was inclined more like his younger sister; he wanted to become a teacher. That Else gained favor with students, teachers and the Priest because of her friendly, eager and industrious nature is also easy to believe. And who can doubt, having known her, but that she gathered friends and admirers, as flowers, along the path which led to her womanhood - friends in whom she delighted!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Christmastime was like a bright diamond laid in the center of winter. No one went to school then. Preparations began long before the time, especially where the gathering of supplies and cooking were concerned. The holiday itself lasted twelve good days and everybody wanted to be in on it. Even the shops were opened but half days for part of the time only, since nobody wanted to be spending time buying then - nej! There were the Holy days and the half-Holy days; food in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-80" title="80"></span> abundance, presents, and much celebrating and merriment all around, as well as worshiping in the church, with many candles lit. There were lanterns hung at every cottage door in welcome, garlands of scented boughs hung round inside and vines of potted house plants traveling over windows and walls; with the Yule log set to burning on the hearthstone. The eve before Christmas was the happiest time of the whole Yuletide, but especially for the young ones. At 4 p.m. on Dec. 24th, all businesses and shops closed in the villages and everybody went home from there. Farm laborers and house servants were sent home, if they had homes; otherwise they gathered with the families of their employers, Then came the big Yule feast in every cottage, which had been made ready beforehand. Roasted goose stuffed with apples and prunes was the favorite, but duck or pork and Sausage might be had instead. There were always potatoes, yellow-root (carrots) sweet-and-sour red cabbage, coffee, tea, beer and all; besides the “rice mush” or pudding, with an almond hidden in it - anyone getting the almond won a prize. A bowl of this was always set out on the doorstep for the Yule Nissen (Christmas elves) who brought the presents. Then there were platters of Danish pastries and other goodies and a wonderful wreathcake, to remind one of the crown of thorns.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Afterwards there was the large Yule tree in the very center of the biggest room, with everything hung on it; strings and strings of small paper flags, little bags of nuts, miniature cookies and homemade candy of almond paste - one could hardly name all that was put on. Then came reading from the Holy Bible about the Christ Child and the manger-crib, and children thought of all the little lambs and friendly animals about. Next came the circling of the tree, with all the family, young and old, joining hands and singing Yuletide hymns. Finally all danced around the tree and ended with a funny song for the little ones, and that was the signal to break-hands. Then what a cry went up until the cottage almost shook with children’s voices:—“Presents Mor - presents - presents - where are the Yule Nissen gifts?” And Mor would hurry out and then bring in a big <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-81" title="81"></span> bag of presents from the doorstep, where the Christmas elves had left it, in place of the rice-mush. There were always presents for everyone in Anders’ household. When the children were small there were tops, dolls and little boxes carved from wood and always a carved figure of a “Hvid Knight” for Mads. Perhaps there was a brooch carved from amber for Mor and a watch chain woven from human hair for Far. As the children added years there might be amber brooches for the girls too, and beads and little amber drops for their pierced ears. Then there was always something to store away in each girl’s “bride’s-chest”, besides books for Else and the others; for had they not hoped for the latest of Hans Christian Andersen’s tales?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From then until Twelfth Night each day had its celebration. Christmas Day was the first “Holy-day” and everybody went to the church, as they did on the following or second Holy-day. Others were only half-Holy-days, and so on those days Danes alternated between church, visiting and entertaining. If the snow fell on and on, slowly and steadily, folks didn’t go very far but kept to their own neighborhoods; but if the weather permitted they usually visited at every farmhouse for miles around, sharing in the festivals of all. When company came, or even if it didn’t, there was celebrating enough to do at home; games to be played and prizes for the winners, with Far, smoking his big pipe, looking on, and dancing, singing, joke-making and food again! Always there were open-faced sandwiches and more pastries with plenty of coffee, tea and beer to wash them down; but better still, for Else at least, were the clouds of fragrance from bowls of Danish soup steaming between islands of dumplings. For the full twelve days of Yuletide, Danes ate and ate, then it was easy to forget the wind and cold outside; but the wonderful days of Christmas one could never forget - Glaedlig Yul! On Twelfth Night girls in their teens or even older ones might well remember the old ritual old Danes told about. They said if a maiden wished to know whom she would marry, then on that night, carrying a shoe in her right hand and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-82" title="82"></span> walking backwards to her bed, she should throw the shoe over her left shoulder, saying at the same time to the three Holy Kings in a whisper:</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">“Show me the very one <br class="calibre4"/> Whose bed I must spread <br class="calibre4"/> Whose name I must bear <br class="calibre4"/> Whose bride I must be.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Then the man of whom she dreamed that Twelfth Night was her bridegroom-to-be; but if she lay dreamless, a future spinster was she! Certainly Mette’s daughters at least thought of such things as the piles in their brides-chests grew and grew.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">It was easy to forget the harshness of winter when days began to lengthen and the land came out in holiday attire, In Jutland’s countryside summer was blue sky with patches of grey-blue and pure white summer clouds over breathless silhouettes: men at work in the fields; cattle grazing in meadows of wild hay (a thousand years ago these same meadows were navigable waterways haunted by sea rovers); beautiful lakes and fjords and some gently rolling hills in places; moorlands and dunes and lovely sand beaches; large and small farms, stick fences, windmills, white churches, gentle thatched cottages, and goose-girls with their buckets of grain; birds flying over the rooftops; and on the coasts the flying shapes of ships - how could one ever forget all these? In summers Else often went with her father in the wagon or buggy, on his various trips about the countryside. Anders loved this capable and willing daughter and, next to Mads, she was the apple of his eye. On such occasions she jumped up at the first cockcrow and was all goose-pimples at the thoughts of it; she loved the outdoors and she adored being with her father. Sometimes they’d stay out almost an entire day. When she was young Far let her hold the reins, but now she was almost to be confirmed he taught her to handle the team and she “spelled him off” with the driving - she had strong hands and arms. Else had long since learned the gentleness, yet firmness, with which horses were to be used, for she sometimes rode horseback too. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-83" title="83"></span> love of the countryside was in the blood of both father and daughter, and as they drove along the taste of salt was in the air and the smell of it in their nostrils. They lived only a few kilometers, or miles, due west from the seacoast, although they had to pass over two or three miles of sand dunes to get there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The bracing, briny wind streaking across Denmark came from the North Sea. It had sculptured Jutland’s west coastline with wonderful sand dunes. The sea was always eating away at the land and casting the chewed-up part back upon the coast in the shape of shining white sand. And so the coastline not far west from Else’s home was covered with miles and miles of restless waves of sand, which, if not tied down with plantings, would move in upon the people, since the wind was always there willing to carry them. In the past, the high dunes had moved like an untamed sea of sand, wave upon wave, across the cultivated fields. Years ago a sandstorm had half buried the old Skagen Church on Jutland’s nose and it had always been a hard battle to secure a few fishing ports along the west coast. Though bathing beaches closely dotted many parts of both the east and west coasts of the peninsula, this was not so along their coastal area; there were no good bathing beaches close to them. But the many large and small “pot-holes” among the high dunes of sand nearby made fine places to picnic away from sun and wind. For vacationers, wishing a tan, there was no better place on earth than these sunbaked dunes; here they too could get sunbaked and somewhat salt-cured as well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now the Danish government was talking about planting forests all along Jutland’s west coastline, inland a few miles between the dunes and the mainland. Another of the farmers enemies, Far said, was the heathland with its accompanying heather, which also grabbed away at the land. It had already started spreading like a blanket over the old peasant settlements of Denmark. Large stretches of this were to be broken up, the soil cleared and crops sown; this would shrink the moors of Jutland and give the farmers back, some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-84" title="84"></span> of their good land. A start was to be made also on drying up the bogs all over the country, as well as the marshlands, and damming up shallow bays and inlets so that large areas of land could be reclaimed; this was good, Ja!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The waves of the North Sea itself were rough and dangerous. There was little peace on the water there. That very year (1860) during a fierce storm 14 ships had run aground, all within a comparatively short stretch of Jutland’s coastline; and Far recalled the old Danes talking about the biggest wreck in the history of the west coast of Jutland. It happened on Christmas night of the very year Mor was born (1811) during the war against England, when the H.M.S, “St, George” and H.M.S. “Defense” were cast upon the sandbars. Of the combined crews of the two ships only 11 men were saved - 1,600 were drowned. To Else, the sea was nothing - let the fish have it; it was the land she loved!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When they stopped to pass the time of day over the fences by the neighboring farms, the talking was of other, more pertinent things: “The Holsteiners are at it again, still threatening to take away Slesvig and just looking for an excuse” - “There’s a dirty lot praying with their hats off; criticizing the State Church right on the Streets” - “Nej, Nej; we’ve trouble enough with those Holsteiners without having religious fanatics sent in” - “If any of these Mormon preachers come within sight or sound of our Parish ‘twill be the devil to pay - they’d better stay clear of our daughters - - !” Then one of the farmers looked up and caught Else’s eyes upon him and leaned closer towards Anders and whispered something she could not hear, crossing himself with one hand while he shook his timber axe with the other, and Anders swore a curse out loud and whispered something back. Then the farmer continued on in louder tones, “They are in Aalborg now these past ten years, but only the poor and ignorant peasants there listen - -.” And so the talk went on at every farm in the same guttural voices, words spewed out in harsh grunt-like sounds, as if the speakers mouths were full of potatoes; for so they spoke in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-85" title="85"></span> all of Thyland; they had a special Danish of their own. All seemed to work themselves up to lathers as they spoke and Else wondered, as she sat holding the reins, “Was it then so bad?” She had heard a bit of talk before about these people; the Priest had mentioned them one day in school, with much scorn, but she had thought not much of it before. Anders said more of it as they drove along home and though he was naturally a quiet- spoken man, he was much exercised about these so-called “Mormons” and took it out on the unsuspecting horses: “If they ever come here I’ll - - - ‘Crack’ - - he brought his whip down on the innocent beasts, and in the jolting and bumping that followed, Else failed to hear what he planned to do then, and she never found out until years later.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Else Cathrine Andersen’s confirmation took place the following April (1861) two months after her fourteenth festival. It was a fine affair, almost as wonderful as a wedding perhaps; and she could say with all her heart that her parents had spared nothing, for Mette certainly knew the importance of the occasion and had seen to it that her second daughter was fitted out for the splendid affair in the very best manner they could afford. She had a long white dress over full, stiffly starched underskirts, white stockings, white linen buttoned shoes, white ribbon bows on her two long amber braids, and a white embroidered shawl for her shoulders afterwards, and a flowered bonnet as well, Mor never forgot anything! There was a new hymn book all her own with her own name on it in gilt and a sweet little “Dagmar Cross”! on a chain for her neck. Else had heard that some peasants even mortgaged their farms to give their daughters proper confirmations, and perhaps encourage better marriages for them; but Anders was happy to be able to afford these things for Else, for he had prospered in Nørhaa. Of all his daughters, Else was the most liked, and even the Priest had said it. He thought she had a future in the schoolroom, should she so desire, and mentioned that he would be pleased to recommend her. Else thought she had never been happier or felt so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-86" title="86"></span> loved and blessed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Several years before (1857) a law had been made in Denmark requiring all present Danes to change their surnames and take the same one as their fathers, This meant that the Andersen children should now go by the surname of Christensen, as Anders did. But Danes were slow to change, especially Jutlanders, and this had taken some thinking about and in Thisted it was not too well enforced, as yet. Young Christen had never gone by the name Andersen, but Christensen, as he was christened, so he had no problem. Mads, on the other hand, decided on.a big change and soon after. his confirmation began using the surname Hvid (the modern spelling of Hviid, from his mother’s father’s side). Mette must have been happy about this, thinking that it gave her second son some distinction to be called by a nobleman’s name - so Mads Christian Hvid his name remained from that time on. The Andersen sisters decided against the surname change for the present, at least; it would be time enough to change when they were married! Else Cathrine however, a little bolder than the rest and now fully confirmed, decided to compromise and changed the spelling of her middle name instead, from Cathrine, as she was christened, to Kathrine, with a K, the more popular way then; ‘twas something she had long kept in her mind.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The northern summer is almost like a paradise on earth, especially for one whose eyes are open to the beauties of nature, so sublime and grand, and whose ears are attuned to the trills of the skylark, the charming tones of the nightingale and other singing birds. One cannot help but inhale the invigorating summer breezes and enjoy the aroma that flows from flora’s bosom. And so it was in Denmark, where the temperature varied between 60-80°, The long, mild days, never too hot, in which one could read a newspaper by daylight up to 10 o’clock at night, were all too few for Else. In midsummer there were frequently 15 hours of sunshine daily, and one could hear happy children playing in the streets, having their hours of romping often until nearly midnight. The parks and city boulevards were filled with promenaders</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-05">
    <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-86a" title="86a"></span> <img alt="Map of Thy" class="calibre7" src="05.jpg"/>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-87" title="87"></span> until long after that and small groups of men and women could be seen chatting together, while love-sick couples strolled hand in hand or seated themselves on comfortable benches in the parks or by cottage doors. The nights were short and light, but somewhat cool. On a clear night one could sometimes catch a glimpse of the “Northern Lights”. Pleasure boats cruised on lakes and fjords and in bays and harbors and huge sailing vessels, at half speed, glided in and out of the larger water ways.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Nørhaa the Andersen girls often sat long together on the bench outside their doorstep, the older ones doing handwork for their brides-chest, while Mads squatted near by whittling away with a knife. They joked, laughed and chatted and told of their plans for the future. Karen was now employed in an embroidery shop but hoped to attend the Folk High School the coming winter, to learn more of fine sewing and to spin and weave. Mads for sure would be a teacher, but first he must do farm work and save his money, then he too would attend High School in winter. Else was undecided, the restless current of Viking blood in her veins kept her uneasy. She longed to see more of the world. They had never been to a city of any size at all, none of them, but only a few miles north or south to visit relatives or east and west for brief excursions with their father, or on picnics somewhere together. What was it like in København? Neither Far or Mor had ever been that far away, as peasant Danes traveled little then, especially those so removed from the center of things in northwest Jutland, even the better class ones. Sometimes in summer, between planting and harvest, relatives from both sides came to see them. Else’s godmother, Aunt Inger Cathrine Christensdatter and her husband, Peter Larsen, came that year. Their oldest son had died that past winter but they brought their seven other children with them. The two older girls were spinsters and sorry for it, but Ann Margrete was just Else’s age and such good company. Onkel Peter had a big black moustache that tickled when he kissed her; he always insisted on kissing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-88" title="88"></span> all his nieces no matter how big they had grown.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Friends from school and the neighboring farm cottages came too, to sit, or walk and talk with the Andersen youths, but there were few young men among them. Mette had her eyes peeled for marriageable males for her daughters; she had four of them to worry about and Karen now was of the age, and soon Else. Mor sometimes spoke of marriage to them and dwelt on the importance of being wed to someone from the better class; — “for when you choose your life’s mate”, she counseled, “it is the whole future of your own blood that you are choosing.” To Else this, for her, seemed far in the future.</p>
