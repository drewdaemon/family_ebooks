  <h2 id="whence-came-this-land-and-its-people" class="calibre9">WHENCE CAME THIS LAND AND ITS PEOPLE?</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Many thousands of years ago there was no land where Denmark now lies, only sea. But then time was one with eternity and there was no man to count the years. Denmark’s biography is shrouded in myth, as is that of other lands. It was once supposed by early scientists that, out of the vast sea which covered all, land and mountains sprang up like veritable “jacks-in-the-boxes”. Modern scientists tell us that the birth of the land was much more gradual; in fact that it took eons of time. Future geologists may come up with other theories, since they are still “digging” for the truth. However, as of now, we are led to believe that at the bottom of the sea, where Denmark’s land later emerged, the shells of myriads of sea creatures piled up during the course of time, their small white skeletons sinking like a continuously moving veil and causing layers of resulting chalk-slime on the sea bed to grow and become hundreds of feet thick. Thus a massive layer of chalk-like substance became the foundation of the new land that rose up beneath the present areas of Denmark and her closest land neighbors. Indications of this can be seen today in the “White Cliffs of Dover” in England, the “Chalk Downs” in France, on the Island of Riigen, and in several places in Denmark, particularly the “White Cliffs” on the Isle of Møen in the Baltic Sea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the great land masses arose the sea retreated. Then time brought the “Ice Age” and great glaciers moved over the northland and locked it in their frigid clutches. No man can tell how often the ice melted and receded, only to return and grip the land again, dragging icy fingers over its surface, clawing out islets, rivers, lakes and <span id="page-8"></span> ridges—to lie long under the ancient stars with no man to name them. When the great ice melted for the last time, enormous bodies of clay and gravel were deposited all along the line of its retreat. But it was ages before the land was finally liberated and left out to dry in the sunshine. However, the land was not even then as it is today, for there was one continuous stretch of it connecting most of the European continent, Only in the northernmost part of the present North Sea area was there any water. All south was land except for a couple of large rivers flowing northward where the “Belts” have since appeared. As the atmosphere became milder this extensive land became covered with dense coniferous forests, interspersed with rivers, lakes and swamps, where roamed wild animals, including reindeer and the mighty Aurochs, long extinct.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now a glacier can weigh upwards of 125 tons per square foot, and when the millions of tons of pressure was finally released from the crust of the earth the land began to sink and the sea, fed by the melting ice, began rising and eating its way into the land. Then began a great struggle for supremacy between land and sea. Century upon century the glutinous sea flung itself in among the trees, overflowing streams and lakes, washing away whole areas and sending all creatures fleeing, panic stricken. Catastrophic storm floods lashed and beat upon mountains and ridges and descended in torrents upon valleys and shores, till much of the land gave way and was lost beneath the roaring waters. The surface that remained was scarred and totally changed. Out of the great travail of this land, Denmark was born, - Jutland and her 500 green islands.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The story of prehistoric man is also founded only in myth. It is supposed that the first humans to come to this area were reindeer hunters from central Europe, following the reindeer north as they followed the retreating glaciers. Then there came to live throughout the “Nordland” other hunters from the south, with their families, who sought their food in the great forests and in lakes <span id="page-9"></span> and streams. Undoubtedly life and death to those primitive peoples depended upon the success of their hunting and fishing—and the caprice of the elements. As the land was broken apart and grew smaller and much of the forest was washed into the sea, animals became scarcer and the age of the early hunter was over. The inhabitants, forced to seek their food mainly in the sea, lived on oysters, fish and seal meat, etc. Filtering down through the dimness of the past comes evidence that there were such fishermen living on Denmark’s ragged shores a few thousand years before Christ. Remains of hundreds of the settlements of these early oyster-eating inhabitants have been found along her coasts. The timing may be wrong but the existence of such people is a certainty. Whether they were descendants of earlier hunters or whether they were newcomers is not known.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As waves of the sea had swept in over this land called Denmark, altering its contour bit by bit and age by age, so waves of culture swept in over its people, molding their lives as they climbed the great ladder of progress from savagery to civilization, rung upon rung, About 3000 to 2000 B.C., it is believed, tribes from the south infiltrated the domains of the oyster-eaters and brought with them a new form of survival—agriculture! They taught these people how to raise their food and domesticate animals, and they carried with them implements of stone, including stone axes that meant life to Denmark’s first farmers but death to her remaining forests. Life there took on new meaning: the sound of axes rang, trees crashed and new clearings appeared. To this day flintstone axe blades can be found buried in the soil all over Denmark and they say there are not many farms in the country without a few specimens lying around. In fact, we are told they have been found in the tens-of-thousands, some complete with wooden handles. Magnificent great stone axes and daggers have been found preserved in bogs and beside corpses in burial tombs of that “stone age” period. Since it is sincerely believed and most probable that the majority of present day Danes are direct descendants of those stone age people of Jutland and her islands, is it not also <span id="page-10"></span> probable that we too have some stone axe swingers on our family tree?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About 2000-1000 B.C. there must have come another wave of immigration to Denmark whose leaders wielded huge battle axes of pure copper, Likely only the better class peasants could afford to keep up with the copper axe Joneses since this costly metal had to be imported from Italy, whose merchant ships were even then trading along Denmark’s shores. It was during this so-called “Bronze Age” that the Danes built trading vessels of their own and went abroad. They had something more precious to trade than copper, bronze or gold—a wonderful substance, “sea gold”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For a long, long time the Danes have been able to pick up from their beaches this stuff they call “sea gold”, but we call “amber”. A golden resin, originating from the ancient coniferous forests of the area, it gets washed out of the soil of Germany and into the sea, whereafter it drifts ashore on Danish coasts, Some gets washed up from the bottom of the sea and comes to rest on the west coast of Jutland, In ancient days girls wore this Danish sea gold in the form of colossal multiple chains with large center pieces and for belts, ear rings and other types of ornaments. In early tombs were found enormous ornaments consisting of hundreds of amber beads. Danes began using amber and soon other countries were clamoring for it. Even the graves were robbed of their “sea gold” and it was sold to people of the Mediterranean. Denmark became famous for this beautiful substance and early sea captains found their way to the Baltic and took away this treasure from “Amber-Land” (Basileia) as the Greeks called Denmark. When Danish ships started trading they carried furs, fish, flint, and perhaps cattle and slaves, but first and foremost - amber! During the bronze age Denmark apparently engaged in brisk and steady trading, even as far as Egypt, and became a rich land, Then this seeming paradise was suddenly shattered by the coming of the Celts to Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Celts, a brave war-like people from Asia Minor, fond of ornaments and fine armor, <span id="page-11"></span> came in their chariots, led by Druid priests and, over-running Greece, Rome and Gual (France) landed in the British Isles. They became masters of vast regions but they never managed to force their way into the north countries. However, they formed a barrier between Denmark and the south and west and put quite a “crimp” in her trade. Though the Celts never came to Denmark, except perhaps a few to trade or as prisoners of war, the things they brought with them came - disease and war. But the Celts also brought “iron” to Europe in the form of weapons, instruments, chariots and wares. More durable than stone, cheaper and more available than copper, the Danes soon learned to make good use of iron. By more or less the time of Christ the glory of the “Celtic Iron Age” had faded, Denmark had resumed her brisk trading, and Rome set out to conquer the civilized world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caesar’s legions marched through Gual and into the British Isles, and the “Nordland” trembled. But though the Roman conquerors made England theirs for 400 years they were never able to penetrate far into German territory nor up to Denmark at all. This is one reason why the subsequent history of the Scandinavian countries and western Europe is entirely different. True, Rome’s merchant ships continued to sail to Denmark to trade, but her warriors nor the glory of her great metropolitan culture never reached there. No stone houses were built in Denmark during this “Roman Age”; no Roman roads, bridges, theaters, churches, or Roman baths, as in other parts of Europe. Though not a poor country at the time, Denmark’s people looked very poverty stricken in comparison. Their homes were low, dark, windowless huts with holes in the purlins to let the smoke out. The floors were of earth and the huts were divided into two parts—one for cattle and horses, the other for human beings, “Only the upper classes wore fine clothes, brooches and jewelry; ordinary Danes went about in simple woolen garments or animal hides - sheepskins for instance,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finally the Great Roman Empire crumbled and great troubles descended on the British Isles. <span id="page-12"></span> Fierce and cruel Anglo and Saxon tribes from Den- mark’s Jutland and Germany moved upon her shores (450-500 A.D.). These famising barbarians took over the country and struck a blow that nearly wiped out the civilization so painstakingly built up by early monks and scholars there. This was the beginning of the period, so marked with turbulence and intellectual stagnation, known as the “Dark Ages” or the early “Middle Ages”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark was having her troubles too at the time. The Roman emperor, Constantine, transferred his capitol from Rome to Constantinople, thus dislocating Europe’s entire trading system, Since the real money was in Roman trade, Denmark had traded in the south for centuries, but all of a sudden she found that she was no longer in a favorable position for trade. Trade lines, hereto- fore moving from north to south, now started to move from west to east through the Baltic Sea and thence, via Russian rivers, to the new hub of the Mediterranean, This led to trouble in Denmark’s waters as her islands became trading stations enroute and plundering targets for pirates. A competitive battle began between Denmark and Sweden, the Swedes being particularly determined to gain control along Russia’s river courses. Trouble also started for Denmark on her south Jutland border as hostile Germanic tribes gained control of some of her territory there, No longer were Danish tribes permitted to wander at will down through the continent of Europe by way of Jutland’s neck, as heretofore, A population sur- plus developed in the land. Trade cut off and migration stymied, it seemed that the Danes’ only great hope was to take to the sea - and this they did en masse, together with other Scandinavians, with the most unusual consequences! The next few hundred years produced the strangest chapter in Scandinavian history.</p>
