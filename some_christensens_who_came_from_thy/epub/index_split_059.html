  <p class="calibre1">(13) Alma Owen Bartholomew (5) was born 1 May 1902 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. He has most always been called A. Owen. His mother gave the following account of him in her Book of Remembrance:- “A. Owen was born in an upper room in his grandfather Bartholomew’s home in Fayette. Both his grandmothers were in attendance, Grandmother Christensen as the midwife and Grandmother Bartholomew caring for our wants. He was blessed 1 June 1902 in the Fayette Ward by his grandfather, Bishop John Bartholomew. He moved with his parents to Gunnison, Utah in 1907, where he was baptized 10 May. 1910 by John Larson and confirmed the same day by Andrew Thomson. He was ordained a Deacon 7 Nov. 1915 by Ernest Swalberg in Gunnison and attended school there until the spring of 1916.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 27 Mar. 1916 he moved with his mother and brothers and sisters to a homestead ranch some miles east of Lyman, Wyoming (called The Oasis) where he helped his mother and the neighbors on the ranch in summers and attended the Public School and High School at Lyman in winters. He was interested in basketball.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1918 his father bought a nice new brick home in Ogden, Utah in the Fourth Ward where the family moved. That fall A. Owen entered Weber Church College (High School) and attended that school year 1918/19. Here he did some outstandin g work in art and was a member of the basketball team. He was ordained a Teacher in the priesthood 7 Apr. 1919 in Ogden.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At the children’s request the family returned to Lyman, Wyoming the next fall and A. Owen attended high school there that winter. In the spring they moved to Goshen, Utah on a farm <span id="page-722"></span> which he helped his father operate, but the next winter, 1920/21, he returned to the Wyoming area to work in the timber. This he did for two successive winters, living with a family by the name of Foreman, for whom he worked. By that time his father was employed in the carpenter shop at the Tintin Standard Mine near Dividend, Utah, and A. Owen went to work with him and there is where he learned his trade as a carpenter and builder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 12 June 1925 he married a Goshen girl, Anna Patricia Riley, in a civil ceremony in Salt Lake City, Utah. (She was born 1 Feb. 1902 in Goshen, the daughter of John Theodore and Margaret Halpin Riley). A. Owen and Pate, as she was called, first lived in Goshen and he continued work at the Tintic Mine shop, driving back and forth. He worked here from 1922 to 1942 until he was the oldest man there in point of service. From 1942 to 1945 he worked as a supervisor in the construction of the Geneva Steel Company plant near Provo, Utah. In the meantime he had bought a home in Payson close to that of his parents.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He left Geneva and went into construction on his own for a few years, building houses, etc. He then joined the Davis Construction Company as supervisor of construction and worked for that company for many years, or until he became ill. As A. Owen tells it, “I decided to retire due to my poor health but I recovered and did not enjoy being idle so went back to work again for the same company.” A little later he went to work for the Rosenlof Construction Company. Among other things, he has supervised the construction of numerous disposal plants throughout the intermountain area and on the coast over the years, his most recent one being the one at his hometown of Payson, Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“A. Owen retired from construction in May of 1968. Since then he has been supervising at the Payson disposal plant, working the equivalent of two days a week, which is about all the law allows for a retired person. Perhaps now he will have a little more time to indulge some of his favorite hobbies. He loves the great out-of-doors and to hunt and fish. In April this year (1969) he and Pate will visit their eldest son in Memphis, <span id="page-723"></span> Tennessee—that is, as Pate says, if they can get their bags packed and on their way before a new baby comes along in the family; for at such times Pate is always called to “baby sit” - and she loves it! The two occasionally drive out to Uinta County, Wyoming to visit friends. A. Owen says that “The Oasis” is a big sheep ranch now and much of the land around is covered with gas wells.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At present A. Owen’s once light auburn hair is beginning to gray. He used to stand at five feet eleven inches, but says he thinks he has “shrunk” a little in the last few years. His health is comparatively good. Though he never did much with his ability in art, the talent seems to have been passed on to his children, some of whom have been outstanding in this field, Elayne as a dancer and Philip as a designer and decorator of some note.</p>
