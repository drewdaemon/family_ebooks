  <h2 class="calibre9" id="ellen-elaine-christensen">Ellen Elaine Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(16) Ellen Elaine Christensen (4) writes her own story and begins with the question, “What am I?” Then she answers it as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I’m a contradiction and a conflict both within and without: Without, because I often feel lithe, beautiful, free and graceful; but on passing a mirror or on seeing my silhouetted shadow before me, I am well aware of the contradiction. Inside, because I want to be good, kind, noble and great but am beset by the willful, stubborn drives of a true daughter of Ephraim. So many of the faults I dislike in others, I possess; so external, internal and eternal conflicts war. However, I have always had great patterns to copy and am a ready repenter, hoping for the years to mellow and perfect me; and perhaps they will - not in and of themselves but because of the influence of friends, family, church, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-729" title="729"></span> and God who hears and answers my prayers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I know that, looking back on one’s youth, memory makes childhood a constant summer. I have heard no tale of unusual happenings when I was born, 12 Oct. 1902 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, except that Aunt Retta was furious with Father because I came along, a ten pound tub of a baby, to ‘little Jennie’ her sister, when my sister Virginia was but thirteen months and six days old. Our first home was on 155 North 2nd West. I remember the house as a two-story white brick structure set back from a black iron fence, a space of lawn parted by a gravel path which led to a front porch and then on around the south side of the house to a kitchen entrance and farther on to a large back lot with garden plot, woodpile, outhouse and a corral.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Inside the house on the ground floor were a parlor (seldom used in winters) one bedroom, kitchen, pantry, non-plumbed bathroom, and dining room, the latter being the family gathering place. Here and in the kitchen were coal stoves which furnished the only heat. I remember white starched lace curtains at the dining room windows, a square table, chairs, a couch bed, and the pot-bellied stove behind which we children played house. The old range in the kitchen was also a gathering place, in the warmth of whose open oven door we took our baths in a galvanized tin tub before donning either our nightgowns or our long-legged fleece- lined cotton union suits and long black stockings, bloomers, flannel petticoats and starched dresses. I remember the hum of the kettle and its steam coating the windows which steam turned to crystal frost before morning. We had to scratch it away with our fingernails before we could peer out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There was one partially finished bedroom upstairs, used only in summers, which we reached by climbing up steep wooden steps, past naked spaces of beams, braces, brick chimney and sloping, dusty eaves of the attic - a scary place of creaking sounds, lurking spiders and bats - yet a place of wonders because here through the small and only window I was lifted up to see Haley’s Comet and shivered for the end of the world. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-730" title="730"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One of our special amusements was a chair-swing in which we played ‘train’. Although the little boys were rough and pushed it to its limit, the swing lasted for years. Once, for some unknown reason, I built a fire under this swing; but when I heard mother phoning the police (with her finger on the receiver) my repentance was swift and tearful. One of our greatest (yet most horrifying) sports was to be chased by the little boys with daddy-long-legs which always seemed to be plentiful. The dread of these kinds of insects has lasted me throughout life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was here at this old house that I learned that if you hid raw eggs too long before Easter they didn’t smell very good. Starting two or three weeks before Easter, our entire family engaged, separately, in hunting, gathering and hiding eggs under an-old tub, in the woodpile, ditch, goose-berry bushes, etc. If we found someone else’s cache it became ours. The one to bring in the most eggs at coloring time got.a prize - it was as exciting as hiding Christmas presents. We didn’t know about the ‘Easter Bunny’ then. I remember catching toads and getting warts (disproved now); I remember the entire family being mustered together with dishtowels and papers to shoo flies out of the screen doors; I can still smell the glue on the fly paper which hung from ceilings and doors, where black, shiny wings buzzed and spindle legs tugged to get free; I hear again the seething, droning mass of fly bodies in the wire catcher outside. I recall throwing Virginia’s shoe out in the rain and being sent to get it. Just as I stooped to retrieve it, lightning forked and thunder broke and I fell flat in a puddle of mud. The resultant fear of electric storms lasted until I pretended calmness for the sake of my own children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Other happenings creep along the edge of memory as I write - the day the house caught fire, starting and ending in the attic; the old stove-heated flat iron scorching the window sill where someone had set it to cool; the rocks heated and wrapped in paper to warm our icy beds in winter; the making of paper flowers for Decoration Day (mother prefered wild flowers from the hills); the sweet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-731" title="731"></span> gravy-taste of lumpydick; the pinpoint, dark eyes of our baby tender who chanted, ‘Hark, hark! The dogs do bark; the beggars are coming to town….’ to bring us into meek submission; the dancing of a row of paper dolls made from folded newspapers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I enjoyed a great feeling of love, security and family solidarity in that old home, so it was with a deep sense of loss that I left it to move with the family to Mabey’s house across the road west from the school until our new home on Depot Street was finished. It was here in the summer of 1910 that I contracted a mild case of scarlet fever and was quarantined, along with mother, in Grandpa and Aunt Lydia’s stuffy parlor with its upholstered furniture, gilt framed pictures, stiff lace curtains and marble fireplace. I was happy when I was transfered to the sitting room where the organ was. I played school with marbles as pupils and empty thread spools as desks, while mother wrote. Sometimes, if I would lie still on the bed, she’d sing in her sweet contralto voice a sad song about an Indian maiden, which I shall always love - ‘Fallen Leaf’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In October of 1910 we moved into our new house via a long stepladder through the upstairs Blue Room window, since our lovely stairway was being varnished. I longed for the old home one half block away but I soon found even greater happiness here with inside plumbing, clinking radiators, and a fireplace around which the family gathered while Daddy peeled apples and mother read stories to us. The church had no need to institute’Home Evenings’ for us then as ours were constant, complete, and gratefully now, remembered.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There was always so much to do. around our new place in summers. Our big garden was fun to play Pioneer in; our barn made good jumping from the loft into the hay; the long, knotted rope hanging from the apricot tree back of the house was sheer joy to swing on. For playing Statue, Prisoner’s Base, and Steal-Sticks, our big west lawn couldn’t be beat, or to lie on to watch cloud-pictures in the sky. The shade of the weeping willow tree was wonderful to sit in while mother <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-732" title="732"></span> read to us on summer afternoons. During many dusk-drawn evenings our family took supper to the fields, ran races through the clover, waded barefoot in the streams and gathered pretty pebbles from the riverbed; or while listening to the sighing winds and twittering birds in the cottonwood trees, watch the day slowly die in the west.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During other evenings the children of the neighborhood met under the street light on the corner to play Kick-the-Can or Run-Sheep-Run. There were other fun things I remember, like dressing up cats and playing house with them; playing postoffice using loose rocks in Horning’s old rock wall to put our letters under; making honey and taffy candy; taking trips to Temple Hill and Devils Ribs; having corn roasts at the Green canal; swimming in the muddy, carpy Sanpitch River; watching the ‘pig-man’ kill pigs through a knothole in Alder’s back fence; waiting for Mr. Harmon’s train-hack so we could jump on back and take a ride, and playing show in Felt’s barn. I don’t remember the name of those shows but I do remember some of the lines - ‘Zeek, Zeek, long- legged Zeek. Your head is all right but you’ve got such big feet’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember special celebrations - the Fourth of July. On the eve of the Third we laid out our embroidered dresses, ribbon sashes, new shoes, stockings and petticoats - all ready for the morning salute of the guns to be up and about the fun of the day. The band, transported on a hayrack, serenaded the town dignitaries and always included our place. Then came the parade which ended in front of the Tabernacle where the patriotic meeting followed. The place was draped with bunting and everybody crowded into hear, year after year, the singing of ‘The Flag Without a Stain’ and the dramatic reading of ‘Ring, Grandpa, Ring; O Ring for Liberty!’ My heart swelled with a great love for my country - would that I could recapture more often the depths of that feeling now! The fear of lighted firecrackers being thrown under our feet has almost been forgotten in the remembrance of the joy of those celebrations. The matinee dance at Felt’s Opera House (in later <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-733" title="733"></span> years at the Armory) and fireworks at our place afterwards completed the long, satisfying day. The Twenty-Fourth always seemed quite anti-climatic, except that I associated it with Christensen family reunions held on Grandfather Christensen’s birthday, July twenty-second and often extending to the Twenty-Fourth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I don’t remember too much emphasis being placed on our church going although we were encouraged to attend Sunday School. I don’t remember our parents going with us but they must have gone to church in the afternoons. My baptism into the church, which took place 5 Sep. 1911 in the Manti Temple, came after almost a year of procrastination. Quince Crawford baptized me at that time and Niels Anderson confirmed me. I recall going to Mutual occasionally on Sunday evenings and that Virginia and I sang in the Ward choir when we were quite young. Perhaps I was the one who didn’t go to church much, but I had the same childlike faith in my Heavenly Father that I did in Santa Claus and my earthly father. I was somewhat in awe of the first two but I wanted to do the things that would please each. I knew that each had unquestioned powers to grant the desires of people who believed. Through the years, I think I can count the times on the fingers of one hand that I haven’t knelt in nightly petition. The last words we heard after kissing our parents. ‘goodnight’ were, “Good night - hope you sleep well - don’t forget to say your prayers.” Hell was a very real and burning place to me with all the everlasting tortures of old world beliefs, but I had faith that prayer would keep me out of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When mother was so ill and I heard doubts of her living, I went about my days smugly, knowing that I had prayed with all my heart that God would heal her and I was sure he would, as he answered the prayers of faithful children. When I heard the news of her death, I felt lost and cheated and began to question a Father who promised one thing and gave another. I was in Heber City at the time, staying at Aunt Retta’s home. I can still feel against my bare legs the rough boards of the box in the chicken coop where I sat most of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-734" title="734"></span> the day, grieving over my lost mother and my lost faith. Sometime before that I had learned about Santa, too. I was sure mother knew my feelings as she seemed so close to me after she’d gone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Many times, remembering mother, I’d cry. Perhaps, besides missing her, I recalled the times I’d stood on the rockers when she was trying to rock the baby and wouldn’t move at her first gentle request; or when she’d asked a favor I’d been stubborn about it and she’d tell me that I’d be sorry some day and I’d say I didn’t care. She’d look at me thoughtfully and say, ‘Well, little daughter, when I’m no longer here then you’ll care.’ I hadn’t talked things over with mother like Virginia had, but after she’d gone I told her through my tears of my secret longings and my love for her. Since then I’ve always felt her nearness and closeness and she’s been to me an ever-present buffer between my rebellious nature and temptation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Perhaps I could have been taught by my parents to work harder and to more purpose but they seemed to want us children to be carefree and happy, and we were. Dad was a lawyer, County Attorney, and finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial District. We were comfortably situated in one of the nicest homes in town, had one of the first Buicks, and owned farms, sheep, cattle and horses. In 1915 Virginia and I went with our parents to the Worlds Fair at San Francisco, Calif. and the overflow of it at San Diego, Calif. A few days ago, when I saw a news reel on T. V. describing the renovation of some of the buildings of that Fair, I recognized some of them and began to recall some of my experiences at the Fair. I remembered my insistence on wearing my new Girl Scout uniform the entire trip; the little electric one-seated carts guided by a hand bar that we used for transportation at the Fair; the flocks of pigeons that flew around and above us dangerously; the lighthouse we visited and the baby crab I picked up on the beach and hid in Dad’s suitcase, much to the consternation of the hotel manager a few days later when he was called in to investigate the sickening odor of decay that emanated from the closet in our room. He <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-735" title="735"></span> found the cause and Dad found the culprit - ugh and ouch!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have always liked school from the time I entered kindergarten at the age of almost six years. My first teacher was Miss Cox, who was keeping company at the time with my Uncle Joseph Snow. When he dropped in sometimes to visit, I loved to sit on his lap to impress my teacher and schoolmates. My favorite teachers in the upper grades were Emery G. Epperson, Andrew Judd, Elmer Peterson and of course, Ellis Johnson who did so much to stimulate my love of fine music.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My high school training was a bit sketchy. I attended one year at Manti High and one year and two quarters at the B. Y. High in Provo, Utah, where Virginia and I boarded with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Oscar Hyde. After a six weeks summer school at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where I boarded with Aunt Retta Neff, I entered as a freshman at B.Y.U. in Provo, In the spring of 1925, after one years teaching at Manti High and Junior High schools in between, I graduated from B.Y.U. with high honors. The following summer I went with B. Y. U. coach Eugene Roberts, Chick Hart, Wilma Jeppson and Mildred Lewis to the University at Madison, Wisconsin, where I took speech and physical education preparatory to teaching in the Lehi High School in Utah County. I have taken summer school classes, extension and correspondence classes numerous times since then, until I now have the equivalent of a Masters Degree.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My teaching experience has beena very satisfying one to me. Aside from the year 1923/24 when I taught music, reading and drama in the Manti Junior and Senior High Schools. I taught in Lehi from 1925-1937, teaching speech, U. S. History and Physical Education in the High School. From 1937 to 1949 I taught music, physical education and English in the Junior High School at Cedar City, Utah, where my husband, Edward Webb Southwick, had moved to work as Office Manager for Bradshaw Chevrolet Company. In 1955 I joined the C. S. U. faculty in Cedar City as teacher of basic communications. My duties and time increased until I was soon teaching three-fourths <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-736" title="736"></span> time and acting as girls activity counselor. In 1961 I became an assistant professor and added the duties of Dean of Women to my load. I terminated my teaching at C. S. U. the spring of 1963 except for a summer class each year in children’s literature and an occasional night class. This year 1968/69, however, I have been teaching again full time at the College but haven’t decided whether to continue longer or not. Ted and I have recently moved into a lovely new home and I should like to be able to enjoy it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Regardless of my teaching I have been quite active in church. I taught Primary in the Manti Center Ward the year 1923/24; in the Salt Lake Eighteenth Ward 1934-1936, where I was also teacher trainer; had charge of drama one year each in the Twentieth and Belvedere Wards. I served in the MIA presidency in the Eighteenth Ward and taught the Social Science lessons in the Belvedere Ward between the years 1933-1936. In Cedar City I taught the Silver and Golden Gleaners in the College or Eighth Wards; was on the MIA Stake Board for several years before Cedar Stake was divided from Parawan Stake and was on the Relief Society Stake Board for about five years. I led the Singing Mothers for many years and helped to produce two Stake pageants. I served as Literary leader for four or five years as well as being director of the Singing Mothers. I was on the Genealogical Society Stake Board of Cedar West Stake for two years, first secretary of the Cedar City Genealogical and Historical Society, taught a class in home records in Sunday School, did research for hundreds of names on our Mathis and Southwick lines, as well as doing the temple work for about two hundred of these kindred dead over the last years. I was a 100% Relief Society Visiting Teacher for five years. I am grateful for these church opportunities for I know that it is through activity that one’s testimony grows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">‘My music career has been a hit and miss affair. Mother always sang at her work and taught Virginia and me to sing and love music. She and Father showed great interest in the cultural affairs of the community. When I was about eleven years <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-737" title="737"></span> old Father bought a lovely Baldwin piano, which my son Richard has now. Until marriage separated us, Virginia and I played and sang duets and put on numerous skits for programs. I had to be prodded to keep at my piano practicing, but did manage to play in several recitals. The first I remember was when I played ‘Scarf Dance’; Virginia played a violin solo. The last was on Aug. 25, 1918 when I played ‘Rustle of Spring’. I could play for hours to amuse myself, entertain others and accompany some. In 1935 I went on Fred Graham’s Lyceum Bureau program tour as a reader and as an accompanist for Lowell Hicks, Marimbaphonist.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Singing was more to my liking. Florence Jepperson Madsen gave Virginia and me private lessons for several years while we were at school in Provo. She offered us many opportunities in choruses, operas, duets and solos. Years later I took from Richard Condie when I joined the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir as alto No. 29. While teaching music in Cedar Junior and Senior High, I wrote and directed my own opera, I have always been a member of some musical group and for several years sang the contralto solos in Handel’s Messiah, both in Cedar City at Christmas time and in Zion’s Park Easter pageants. Ihave had three songs published; one, The Lions Roar’, has been the official Cedar City Lion’s Club song since about 1940. Many unpublished ones are gathering dust in my piano bench.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Drama! Ah, there was my heart. Secluded in the Blue Room in Manti when I was young, I could be anyone I wanted to be, as my mirror could testify since I emoted in front of it through many dramatic experiences. I took part in most of the plays and operettas in public school. In Sixth Grade, how I loved ‘A Dream of Fairyland’. I would have liked to be dressed in tinsel and gauze as Virginia and the rest of the good fairies were, but I was better suited as a leader of the bad elfin band, trying to coax two little children to go astray.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In college I took leads in quite a few productions: Priscilla, Great Divide, Old Lady 31, The Country Boy, The Gondaliers, and others. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-738" title="738"></span> was a charter member of Mask Club and Theta Alpha Phi at Provo. I coached two college plays, also one opera, and assisted with the coaching of Sazy for the Provo Stake Relief Society, which we repeated later in the old Salt Lake Theatre. I played one of the leads in a Salt Lake Stake play presented at the Ralph Cloniger Theatre. I was also the lead in two MIA contest plays which won the church finals: Tombs and In Secret Places, where I played opposite Gordon Owen. In Cedar City I have played leads in Anastasia, Women Have Dominion, The Glass Managerie, Arsenic and Old Lace, and I Remember Mama, which we repeated fourteen times. I have given many play readings and solo poetry recitals. There have been so many opportunities for me and until the last few years I’ve had great difficulty saying ‘no’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Each year, besides my assigned duties, I try to take a group of ladies and teach them how to read and enjoy poetry, or I teach a class in poetry writing. I have many other delightful hobbies besides those already mentioned - tatting, knitting, quilting, oil painting, golfing, writing poetry, talking, playing Five Hundred, Sluff and Bridge, and traveling. Our family has been from coast to coast and border to border and to Canada and Mexico. Besides exploring the scenic wonders of our own country, my husband and I have each been to Europe twice and to Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Since Ted and I were married in the Salt. Lake Temple in 1927 (May 25) by David O. McKay, we have had a hill and valley life together - varied enough to remain interesting and satisfying. As it is in any geological time, the parks and mountains flatten out and form peaceful valleys - so it is with our marriage. We have four wonderful children and fifteen remarkable grandchildren. My patriarchal blessing says: ‘One of the objects of this life is to be the mother of a noble race of men’. I’m sure my one lovely daughter is included in this. If I can be judged by the accomplishments of my children I know I have done well. Yet I know that I have left much good undone and have undone much good by impulsive actions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As yet, I don’t feel too comfortable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-739" title="739"></span> vegetating in a rocker; rather I would have my days continue with health, purpose and diverse conflicts and contrasts that will keep me searching, experiencing, relenting and accomplishing. I would be about my many yet unlearned lessons. I’m looking forward to the day when, either from my rocker or my eternal mansion, when my children can forget my failings and weaknesses and can bring to pass the promise given to me in a comfort blessing by Brother Joseph A. Cornwall in 1932, in which he said: ‘Your children will grow up and honor and bless your memory. They will be proud in time to claim that they are called of your name. They will proclaim to the world in beautiful terms your service to them, your comfort to them, your blessing to them, and your desires of them for their good in the earth.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Edward Webb Southwick, “Ted” was born 15 June 1899 in Lehi, Utah, the son of Edward and Rachel Ann Webb Southwick. For many years now he has had his own tax company in Cedar City and doesn’t plan to retire. He is enthusiastic about golf and plays a good game. He is also a great sports fan and follows the football and basketball conferences either in person or on TV and radio. He keeps up a regular correspondence with his children and travels to visit them often, in conjunction with Elaine.</p>
