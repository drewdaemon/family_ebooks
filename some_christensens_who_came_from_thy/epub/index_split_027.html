  <h2 class="calibre9" id="with-flags-flying">WITH FLAGS FLYING</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Word of her hour of coming had gone ahead to her loved ones there. When she arrived at the railway station in the beautiful city of Thisted, on Jutland, she was met by the husband of her oldest sister Karen, Mikkel Skaarup. Though they had never met he had doubtless been directed to “look for the woman with the child on her arm”. He had come in a beautiful carriage with a coal black team of horses and soon they were riding through the countryside of Thy, headed a bit north and some three miles west from Thisted, to the village of Thorsted, where Mikkel and Karen lived with their eight sons and one daughter, ranging in ages from seventeen to three years. The Skaarups owned a nice roomy cottage and a big farm in Thorsted. It was harvest time - soon they would be threshing their grain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When they entered the village and drove past the white church and out to the Skaarup place, Danish flags were flying from cottages and flagpoles. “What Danish holiday or celebration is this?” asked Else, as she viewed them, “We fly<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-327" title="327"></span> the flags because our lost sister has returned to us”, answered Mikkel, “why shouldn’t we celebrate?” And what a festival it must have been when Else was reunited with her three sisters and her brother Mads; for we have been told that they were all gathered there to greet her. Then she needs must meet their families, for they too had all come. Besides Karen’s and Mikkel’s nine children there were Mads’ frail wife Else and their six living children, two boys and four girls of ages one-and-a-half to thirteen-and-a-half, and Stena’s husband, Svend Poulsen, and their three daughters and three sons from fifteen years to five months old. It was difficult to straighten out all their names! Marie of course had no one - but she made up for it in most loving greetings. Yes, all had come to see the much-talked-of Aunt Else from America and her small foster daughter Ada. Wonderful children they were too, thought Else, but none any finer than her own six sons and three daughters back in Zion!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And back in Zion midsummer of that year, the Board of Examiners for Church Schools, with the approval of President Wilford Woodruff, had chosen Gunnison as one of the places to hold three-day examinations for prospective teachers. The exercises had been held July 28-29-30, 1890, in the Relief Society Hall, with Dr. Karl G. Maeser presiding and educators from Randolph, Bear River, Wasatch and Sevier conducting tests on the theory and practice of teaching theology, grammar and composition, orthography, elocution, geography, history, hygiene, arithmetic, bookkeeping, penmanship, drawing and music. This event had been looked upon with great interest inasmuch as it had been the first of the kind ever held in Zion. Joseph Y. Jensen was one of the Sanpete Valley residents to apply and be granted a teachers license at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Seminary teaching commenced that fall in Gunnison and this was held in the upper room of the Relief Society Hall. Joseph Y. Jensen was appointed Principal. The Bible was studied on Mondays and Thursdays, the Book of Mormon on<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-328" title="328"></span> Tuesdays and Fridays, and Wednesday was testimony day. Of course numbers of other subjects were taught in addition to theology, including Domestic Science for the young women. On Friday nights the Philosophical Society presented lectures, readings, musicals, etc., and these were great affairs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert Christensen was one of the some seventy-five students attending classes and activities that fall and recalled some of his experiences in these words:— “In the fall I started school at the Gunnison Seminary. I greatly enjoyed my work. While I was a little rusty as a student, I soon began to find myself. One day we had as a lesson the learning of the names of all the countries of South America and also the capitols of those countries. It happened that either by neglect or for some other cause I was unprepared. It was a surprise to me to find that the entire class likewise was unprepared. The teacher said, ‘If Albert can’t get the lesson you may all be excused’. I concluded that if the teacher had such confidence in me I would see to it in the future that I was prepared… This was about the first year that I had engaged in social activity such as dancing and other public entertainment. Needless to say it opened up to me a new world. It was a happy year both at home and at school. My mother had gone to Denmark to visit her people but returned sometime during the year. My sisters Elsie and Emma, who helped care for the home, had seemingly grown up during my absence. My father was always handy with home duties and was most agreeable at all times.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among the many other students to attend the Gunnison Seminary that fall and winter of 1890/91, besides Albert, were his brothers Andrew and Joseph, as well as Christen’s and Anne’s daughter Caroline and sons Andrew and John T., and Miss Roxie Bartholomew of Fayette. Albert’s older brother Andrew, who had been out of school for a number of years, had begun to realize the fallacy of not having an education, as is told by his daughter Edythe:— “More than once I’ve heard father<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-329" title="329"></span> tell of leaving home at age thirteen to work. It was in the employ of one Julius Christensen. It was in the solitude of the mountains, while watching his employer’s sheep, that Andrew dreamed his dreams and made his resolves - he would re-enter school! A strapping young man, older and taller than most of his classmates, he came back to face the lower classroom of Gunnison Seminary, where he buckled down to work in earnest.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert’s sister Elsie tells of her enrolling in the Seminary about mid-term, as follows:—“At age fourteen (1889) I went to the Snow Academy in Ephraim, which had been founded the year before, on 5 Nov. 1888. My brother Joseph also attended then. This was a preparatory and intermediate school. In the fall of the next year (1890) I kept house for my father and family while mother and a foster child went to Denmark to visit her folks. Her family there in Denmark celebrated the return of ‘their lost sister’. After she returned home I started to attend the Seminary in the Gunnison Ward. Joseph Jensen was the teacher. This was in January 1891.” So as it was, all of Laurs and Else’s nine children were living at home while she herself was visiting in far -off Scandinavia - that is all but the oldest son Christian, who was away with the sheep. Six, and later seven, were in school. Nothing made this couple happier than to see their offspring seeking after their educations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else spent the better part of three delightful months visiting the land of her birth and the loved ones of her youth. There were plenty of babytenders to watch little Ada and give her freedom to visit all around. True to her word, it was usually her unmarried sister Marie who had closed her door and gone along with her to visit the “old ones” and all their other living kinfolk in Thy. Before Else had left her home in Gunnison she had taken her scissors and hurriedly snipped out eighteen blank pages from her medical journal (those between 35 and 71). These she had placed in her handbag and brought with her, and as she traveled on foot, or by Danish train, carriage or wagon from village to village and cottage to<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-330" title="330"></span> cottage greeting her relatives, she had questioned them and jotted down names, places and dates of births, and any death dates of parents and children in each particular family, until these pages were filled. Although most greeted her with exuberant affection, none would have ought to do with the doctrines of Mormonism. This was particularly so when she visited her brother-in-law Christen, down near Hurup, which she had faithfully promised both Laurs and Christen Sr. she would do. Though she received scant enough welcome at his home, nevertheless she wrote down the name and other information about his wife, Else Maria, and their two daughters with the rest, and accepted a photograph of the four to take back to his people in America.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She wept at the graves of her parents in the churchyard at Nørhaa; gazed once more upon the cottage in Kjallerup, where she was born; but most of all she walked and talked with Mads, Karen, Stine and Marie, or sat with them in the evenings. And while they continued to extend to her the kindest hospitality and most sincere love, they would have no talk about religion. Neither did they know much about their genealogy, except for the tradition that their mother’s father’s people, the Hvids, were of the nobility — way back. In the midst of all the jollities, festivals, and genuine happiness of being together with her loved ones and their families, there was a deep well of disappointment in Else’s heart as time drew on and she was unable to speak to any of the Gospel. They had heard and believed far too many rumors of Mormons. Would she ever have another chance to teach them the truth? Not likely! Denmark and America were far apart and who among them there knew the length of their years? And then, when the Jutland wind was howling cold and the long snows had begun, there came the inevitable packed bags - the tearful goodbys - a blur of red and white flags flying in the distance, and Else was sailing west again. “Well there goes Denmark - she’s a Lovely Land!” But soon she began to look for land the other way; she would keep Christmas in Zion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Back in Salt Lake City Else found that horse <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-330a" title="330a"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-331" title="331"></span> drawn streetcars had been replaced by electric ones during her absence; also that the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad had reached Ephraim, only some twenty miles from Gunnison. That is perhaps where Laurs drove his wagon to meet her and the weary little Ada on their return trip home that mid-December 1890. The towering, snow-capped mountains deepening into varying shades of purple as the day transcended into night… . the sky jewelled with the same stars, which here seemed closer somehow… the sheltering arms of her husband… the welcoming shout of “mother”… the fond embraces of her happy children; this was her home, her mountain home!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The cry of a new-born babe in the night - another - then another - “Lars C. Hansen - son - January 1891… Titus Christensen-son-February 1891… William Wasen-son-February 1891… Lundgren-datter-March 1891.” As the new decade called the “Gay nineties” was ushered in, Else K. Christensen picked up her brown kit again and went back to ushering in babies in Gunnison Valley and making entries in her journal. And while she was so busy taking care of the living she found little time to do anything for her dead, even though the words of her blessing must have kept ringing in her ears:—”… You have come forth here on earth in order to accomplish a great mission, along with your husband, for your father’s and mother’s lineage, those who are now dead are in prison and wait to be freed by you and your family.” Laurs, on the other hand, often went to the Manti Temple to do work for his dead with Christen and Anne, who were ever faithful in this work. On a number of these occasions he did work for Else’s deceased male relatives - her father, grandfathers, uncles, and her dead brother Christen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else found herself a new cause to work for early that year - helping to straighten out the political inefficiency and mismanagement in the Territory; for, according to church historian Andrew Jenson, “Under the Liberal Party rule, Salt Lake City became a regular rendezvous for foot pads, burglars and thieves; immorality,<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-332" title="332"></span> wickedness and lawlessness had full sway; taxation was made oppressive and unjust.” This condition was also true in Ogden and some of the other more populous areas where anti-Mormons were gaining control. The church authorities became alarmed and issued a call for the membership to take an active part in the political activities in Zion. The church-supported Peoples Party was dissolved and its former members advised to affiliate with one or the other of the national parties, Republican or Democrat. Thus on May 20, 1891 the first Utah Republican Party was organized and later nominated their State ticket and the Utah Democrats followed suit, organizing on June 20 and having their nominating convention July 8, 1891. In the territorial election which followed, August 3rd, the Democrats elected twice as many members to each of the two legislative bodies, the Council and the House, as were elected by the Liberal Party. The Republican vote was light. It was not until 1894 that the Republicans began showing more strength in the valleys and the Liberal Party was dissolved.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Utah had enjoyed small political influence in the country up to this point. Her various representatives to the national assemblies, if Mormons, were seldom seated without long drawn-out trials and tribulations. Many of the Saints in the valleys were continually deprived of their voting privileges, especially those who were polygamists. Though the Territory was Democratic as a whole and Salt Lake City Liberal, the nation itself was under Republican rule in 1891; Benjamin Harrison, Republican, having been elected United States President Nov. 6, 1888. This president seemed largely sympathetic with the cause of the Saints and on a number of occasions commuted the unjust sentences of various Utah citizens or pardoned them entirely. On Sat, 9 May 1891, President Harrison visited Salt Lake City and was received with great enthusiasm by the large crowd which gathered from far and near. He was replaced as president of the nation by a Democrat, Grover Cleveland, but before leaving office the forepart of 1893, Harrison issued a Proclamation of amnesty to polygamists for past offenses, but recommended vigorous prosecutions against future infractions of<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-333" title="333"></span> the Edmunds law. This act opened the door for the restoration of property and civil rights to the much beleaguered Saints.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else K. Christensen joined the party of Lincoln, the Republican, and became one of its staunchest supporters in Gunnison Valley. It was jokingly said of her that “she could spend all day shearing sheep and then go and give stump speeches for the Republican Party half the night” in her enthusiasm for this cause. It has also been stated that from the time she was first given her voting franchise she never failed to cast her vote in an election to which she was entitled, as long as she lived. She valued this privilege highly. Her Danish sisters didn’t begin to enjoy the same right until 1915, during the First World War, although naturalized women in Utah had been granted their franchise on 2 Feb. 1870. It was while Else was living in Gunnison that she was sent as a delegate from that district to the Republican State Convention in Salt Lake City, to assist in the selection of the Republican state ticket. One might rightly have called her “Mrs. Republican of Gunnison Valley!” Laurs too was a Republican as long as he lived and as long as the party was in existence in Utah, and was undoubtedly just as staunch in his conservative convictions as Else, but obviously much less outspoken and demonstrative.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad finally came to Gunnison Valley the spring of 1891. The first depot was located in west Christenburg on the main road from Mayfield to Gunnison and about two miles from Gunnison proper. As the “iron horse” first came puffing down the track, people were on hand from miles around to witness the great event. Little children screamed, horses bolted, and men and women wept for joy. A gala celebration followed. By 13 June the train had arrived in Axtell, and by 30 June as far south as Salina, The boom of the railroad building, which had sparked the economy of the area for twenty years, pretty well ceased by the end of that year. A depression began and by 1893 was so severe that wheat, the main medium of exchange, sold for as low as 30¢ per bushel. Laurs had worked at<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-334" title="334"></span> railroading at one time or another, during that period, and more recently Joseph and Albert had been employed, helping to build the grade between Sterling and Gunnison and saving what they could of their wages in hopes of being able to attend the Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This dream became a reality for them and others of the Christensens, as told in the autobiography of the daughter Elsie:— “In the fall of 1891 I went to Provo with my brothers Andrew, Joseph and Albert, and Viola Sorensen, to attend the Brigham Young Academy. Sister Capson, Vio’s grandmother, kept house for us. The school was held in the Z. C. M. I. warehouse, near the railroad stations. The roar of the trains and the shrieking of the whistles were not conducive to the best school work but this was the best that could be had at the time.” Actually, the Academy building had been destroyed by fire on Sunday 27 Jan. 1884 and the upper floor of the warehouse was being used to house the school while a new building was under construction.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else had loaded up their wagon that fall with bedding, clothing, food supplies and cooking utensils - all the necessities to get their four children and the others settled at housekeeping in a place they had located for them about three-and-a-half blocks from the warehouse in Provo. Then they drove up there by way of Levan and unloaded the supplies at the low adobe dwelling on 4th South and 142 West, the first house east of the millrace where the Christensen youths and their party took up quarters, There were three separate units in the House. The Christensens and company had two rooms, which must have been a bit crowded for six adults; Esther Ercanbrack and her group from Goshen had two rooms, and the William Ashworth famiy of seven had four rooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the Christmas holidays the Z. C. M. I. warehouse was bandoned by the students, as Elsie relates:— “January 4, 1892, the teachers and students, with the band playing, marched to the new building of the B. Y. Academy between 5th and 6th North Academy Avenue (now</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-21">
    <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-334a" title="334a"></span> <img alt="Family photo" class="calibre7" src="21.jpg"/>Chris “I” Christensen visits his brothers, a sister and a cousin at B. Y. A. about 1892. Left to right: Louis, Myrup, Elsie, Andrew, Joseph, Chris “I” and Albert. 

    <p></p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-335" title="335"></span> University Ave.) On that date the veteran educator, Karl G. Maeser, was released as President of the Academy and Benjamin Cluff was installed as his successor.” The Christensens continued to live in the House of Many Doors until the end of that school year however. The old Z. C. M. I. warehouse stood until this winter of 1967/68 and has just now been torn down. The House is still standing, although its adobes have long since been plastered over and painted a pale green. The Christensens called this dwelling the “Knudsen Place” since it was owned by Hans and Birgetta Knudsen when they lived there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the spring the wagon came again from Gunnison to take the Christensens and their things back home, and the next fall it brought them back to school again. Roxie Bartholomew and her younger sister Sarah came up from Fayette to attend B. Y. A. and Maren and Lars Myrup’s oldest son, Lewis, came up with the Christensens. Though boarding houses changed each year, the method of transportation did not. For the next several years the Christensen wagon went back and forth each spring and fall, often camping on the way, moving the students of the family and their things to and from school at B. Y. A. and more often than not the mother Else would be driving. We have been told that friends in Levan used to watch for that wagon each fall and when sighted would say, “There go the Christensens - the B. Y. A. Can now open its doors!!!” Additional supplies were sent up from home when needed. Some autumns Else came up and stayed in Provo for several weeks in order to get the young people settled. This was true the beginning of school in 1894, when the daughter Emma joined the others at B. Y. A.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This educational opportunity would not have been made possible without the sacrifices and efforts of Laurs and Else, nor would it have been possible without the unselfish assistance of the older son and brother Chris. This should never be forgotten! Though Christian never had the opportunity for much formal education, he was unstinting in the monetary assistance and<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-336" title="336"></span> encouragement he gave to his brothers and sisters in an effort to further their educations. In a history of Christian, written by his daughter Pearl, mention is made of this:— “Christian, being the oldest, had little chance for an education in school. His mother, having had a good education, taught him so that when he entered school he was ready for the upper grades. He studied very hard when he had the opportunity, and had an excellent memory. Christian worked and saved enough money to help his three brothers and two sisters through school at Provo. I have been told that he saved two hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces to assist in their educations. He visited them at Provo once and paid for having all their pictures taken. When it was time for their graduations he paid for graduation pictures, bought new graduation outfits and attended the exercises, When they all returned home to Gunnison a big dinner was served by their mother in honor of the occasion.” Yes, it was largely through the encouragement of their father and their older brother Christian, but perhaps more especially of their mother Else, that six of the nine living Christensen children (all who would take advantage of it) had some college training. Four of them qualified for graduation at B. Y. A. (later B. Y. U.); five became professional teachers, two later graduated from an eastern university, and one studied abroad. In Gunnison Valley they gained the reputation of being a very well educated family - and much of it was “done on a shoe string”, so to speak.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">It was inevitable that the Christensen youths should marry and leave the nest. Of course their parents were concerned that they select worthy marriage companions. Likely Else counseled each of her sons and daughters, at one time or another, as her mother had counseled her, —“When you choose your life’s mate it is the whole future of your own blood that you are choosing!” Albert related an interesting conversation he had with his mother on this subject:— “I had never permitted myself to think about getting married, as I was primarily interested in obtaining my legal education.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-337" title="337"></span> It was well known to my parents that I had the ambition to become a lawyer. I had occasionally taken out a certain young lady and, as far as I knew, she was suitable in all respects. I presumed my mother knew that I was going out with her. It came to my attention that, in talking to one of the neighbors, mother had incidentally remarked that she hoped that I would not marry this particular person. Shortly thereafter I approached mother and told her that I had something very special that I wished to talk to her about. I asked her to come into her bedroom, and accordingly she accompanied me into the bedroom and I closed the door. A chair was placed for her, and taking a seat directly in front of her I said, ‘Mother, I am thinking about getting married’. She seemed stunned - too surprised to speak; and then I added, ‘I would like for you to find me a suitable wife’. She threw up her hands and exclaimed, ‘That’s your business - I’ll have nothing to do with it!’ I said, ‘Well, if that is the way you feel, I will assume the responsibility but I wanted to have it clearly understood between us’. And that ended that and the young lawyer-in-embryo had won his first case.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph was the first to marry. He went to the Manti Temple Wed. 6 Sept. 1893 and Laurs and Else went with him. They must have been delighted with the girl he chose - Roxie, the eldest daughter of Bishop Bartholomew of Fayette. The Bartholomew family had been among the first to settle in Fayette and was considered outstanding in many ways - but particularly in overcoming the wilderness and in devoted service to the Lord. Indeed, Roxie came from fine stock. Her father, John Bartholomew, was Presiding Elder and then Bishop of Fayette for forty-seven years in all. In their new rock house in Fayette he and his capable wife, Eliza Roxie Metcalf, had entertained many of the General Authorities over the years, including church president, Wilford Woodruff, who was a favorite visitor in their home. Two more of the Christensens married into this family, Andrew marrying Roxie’s younger sister Sarah, also in the Manti Temple, Wed. 1 July 1896, and Elsie marrying their brother Alma in the same<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-338" title="338"></span> temple, Wed, 26 June 1901. As their children came along there were many “double cousins” among the Christensen and Bartholomew descendants. It has been said that Sister Christensen and Sister Bartholomew got their heads together and tried to make a fourth match between their two families but Elvena Christensen and Henry Bartholomew didn’t see things their way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The oldest son Christian was the second of Laurs’ and Else’s children to marry and it was to his childhood sweetheart, Caroline Larsen, that he was wed. It had always been felt that Chris would marry the daughter of their old Christenburg friends and neighbors, Ole H, and Inger Larsen. They chose to marry at Gunnison during the Christmas holidays, Dec. 29 that winter of 1893, Her parents gave the couple a fine wedding party that Friday at 4 o’clock in their nice winter home in Gunnison, and we can be sure the Christensens were all invited. “The lovely bride wore a beautiful dress of robin-egg blue satin with orange blossoms in her long, blond hair.” The newlyweds rented their first home but began building their own house right away. This was less than a block east and across the road south from the home into which Chris had moved with his parents as a small boy, when the Christensens had first come to Gunnison twenty-three years before; for he was now twenty~six while Caroline was twenty-two-and~-a-half. In two years the white rock house was finished and the two moved in, along with their year old daughter Pearl.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As each of the Christensen children were married they could at least expect one of Else’s homemade quilts and a pair of her down-filled pillows, Else always kept geese and with the coming of each spring the ritual of plucking their down came too. Though not as hard as shearing sheep, nevertheless this job took a lot of pluck, with the frightened geese honking and almost screaming in pain - though ‘tis said it didn’t hurt them overly much. Winters found Else stuffing pillows or carding the wool she had sheared from their few sheep in spring and making it into batts to line the quilt tops she had pieced from scraps.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-339" title="339"></span> Then she would get out her quilting frames; she nearly always had a quilt set up winter, spring and summer. Though she seemed to prefer community and church work to sewing and cooking, she did plenty of these and did them well. And oh the hundreds of pairs of black wool stockings she knit!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen’s and Anne’s children were also growing up and getting married. Their oldest and only daughter, Caroline, was wed that same year, Friday, 3rd Nov. 1893, in Gunnison. Later she went to the Manti Temple and was sealed to her husband, John Jensen of Axtell. John was the son of Josiah Sr, and Marie Madsen Jensen, some of the first settlers of Axtell. John and Caroline settled in Axtell where he had a nice farm and here all their children were born. The first, a girl they named Annie Lillian, born 17 Feb. 1895, later to become Mrs, Sidney Martin Peterson, who has helped so much with this history. She and her brother Alonzo Jensen, born 28 Dec. 1897, are still living. But Caroline had misfortune with her children after that and lost first a girl and then four boys, one after the other, the first four being stillborn and the last only living long enough to draw a breath. All five of these were of course unnamed.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The year 1893 was not only an important one for the Christensens but for the LDS Church as well. At April Conference that year the glorious Salt Lake Temple, which had been under construction for forty years, was dedicated. But the temple had been thought of even before that when on July 28, 1847, four days after the Pioneers first entered Salt Lake Valley (and when Lauritz Mathias Christian Christensen was six days old we might add) President Brigham Young was walking over the barren ground of Salt Lake City with some of his associates, the site had been selected. Wilford Woodruff became President of the Church and as such had the privilege of offering the dedicatory prayer in behalf of the Salt Lake Temple, 6 Apr. 1893. The dedicatory services were repeated almost daily until 24 April, thirty-one meetings in all being held in honor of this great<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-340" title="340"></span> event. These were attended by a total of nearly 75,000 people. Were any of our Christensens among them? Very likely. But it seems the Christensen sons and daughters favored the Manti Temple in which to be married for eternity; for, whether by choice or convenience, eight of the nine eventually entered its portals for this sacred ordinance. Only the oldest, Christian, and his wife Caroline had their eternal marriage performed in the great Salt Lake Temple - but that is another story.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This was an important year for Gunnison also for near its close, under the power of the Sanpete County Court at Manti, Gunnison finally became a town (late 1893). Efforts to incorporate had been made in 1878 and again in 1881, but these attempts had not materialized and Gunnison had remained a precinct for thirty-four years. The first town council met in January 1894 and Anthony Madsen was selected as town president. Plans were made to build a new city hall and a school house, ordinances were set up and other town officials appointed. It must have been at this time that Else K. Christensen was chosen as Gunnison town doctor, for although no recorded statement to this effect has yet been found among early Gunnison records, which are at best very incomplete, it has long been known that she served as such when the town was first incorporated. Since her brother-in-law, Anthony Madsen, was then serving as town president it seems logical to conclude that he had some influence in securing Else’s appointment at this time. And who else in the Valley was more qualified? How long she served or just what her duties were as such, we have no way of knowing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else had discontinued her public practice as midwife the forepart of 1893. The last entries that appear in her medical journal in this regard are the following:— “Nordfelt - datter - 13 Jan, 1893; Henry Jensen (Mayfield) son 19 Jan, 1893; Chris M. Jensen (Mayfield) son - 22 Jan, 1893; Chris Gravenstien - son - 24 Jan. 1893.” In some histories that have been compiled about Else K, Christensen the statement has been made that she<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-341" title="341"></span> delivered some 2,000 babies in Gunnison Valley during her public service there as midwife. This is highly erroneous, It is questionable if there were half that many babies born in all, in this Sparcely settled valley, during the thirteen-and-a-half years Else was carrying on her practice. Sometimes numbers have a habit of growing, as babies do. Actually, in her journal Else lists a total of three hundred and twenty-one babies that she delivered from June 1879 to Jan. 1893. We know she delivered others later, including a number of her very own grandchildren, but these are not recorded in her journal.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though a specific century may create but a ripple in the main tide of world affairs or leave small mark on the subsequent course yet it is highly important to those whose spans life are cast in that period. We cannot disassociate people from their environments and their environments and their heritage be it physical, political, economic, social or spiritual. The tapestry of man’s character is woven of many fibers - his home, family and friends, his associates, his own personality, his religion, the land in which he lives and what goes on in that land. The quality and depths of such influences make up a good part of the fiber which runs deeply and broadly through the cloth of his character and usually determines his individual integrity or turpitude, be that as it may. The stronger and richer the fibers the more durable and beautiful the tapestry.</p>
