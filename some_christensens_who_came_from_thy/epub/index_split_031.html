  <p class="calibre1">In Salt Lake City, Andrew, doubtless thinking it best to get Sarah and the children away from the scene of their recent tragedy, resigned his position as Principal of the L. D. S. High School and continued his plans to take them all to Europe that summer of 1910. Sarah and the three children, putting aside their grief for brighter things as best they could, took on a project to help, as Edythe relates:— “To raise extra money, mother took a strawberry patch in East Millcreek, on consignment. We drove out early and picked berries every other morning through the bearing season, then sold them dewy-fresh with heaped-up cups.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though this must have been a difficult decision, Andrew and Sarah finally decided to sell their promising place there in order to finance the trip as well as his advanced schooling in Europe. Learning that Chris had decided to leave Gunnison and settle Caroline and the children in Salt Lake where they would be nearer “The Weber” and his work, Andrew approached his older brother on the subject. Edythe writes of this also:— “Our home was sold to father’s older brother, the wonderful Chris I. I have been told by his daughter Pearl, that her parents had already decided to purchase another Salt Lake home before father approached them with the need to sell. His family changed their plans as an accommodation to us. I hope, however, that they felt some of the joy that we had in the old place.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else and Andrew and his family left for Europe that midsummer of 1910, but as things happened they didn’t travel there together after all. Laurs and Else made arrangements to travel with some L. D. S. missionaries, “3 Klasse”, while Andrew and family went a little earlier in July and doubtless had better accommodations. Again we turn to Edythe’s history for the details of their travel then:— “Father, mother, Wendell age 7, Sheldon age 4, and I age 10, left in early July for Europe. Father’s parents were to meet us later in Denmark, to visit among the<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-390" title="390"></span> relatives there. Wherever we went, Father always ‘put himself out’ to give us all the cultural and educational experiences he could - bless him! We traveled first by train to Montreal, Canada. The fortress-like city of Quebec was also a stopover. In each place sites pertinent to early colonial history were visited and the events explained in bright detail. Our ship was of the White Star Line. We cruised along the St. Lawrence River to its mouth, then into the rough Atlantic. After one meal or two mother, Sheldon and I were confined to our quarters for the duration of the voyage. Father and Wendell were not at all affected by the sickness-of-the-sea, nor did they hesitate to boast of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Many others had been ill enroute and so it was in part a pretty peaked-looking group that docked on that one particular afternoon at Liverpool, England, where we were soon taken to a modest hotel in time for a late ‘tea’. This consisted of a platter of thinly sliced white bread spread with sweet imported Danish butter to go with our glasses of milk. In no time the rounds of bread disappeared - they had the taste of ambrosia to us. The serving woman almost despaired of filling up ‘those Americans’. By morning a ‘milk strike’ was on and from our hotel windows we heard the clatter of horse-drawn carts and witnessed cans of the precious white liquid being dumped out on the streets.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We then journeyed to London for a few days sightseeing, taking in many worthwhile things such as the British Museum, Christopher Wren’s handsomely designed Church of St, Paul, and Westminster Abbey, etc., and then went on to Oxford. Here we were settled in a large, comfortable and clean upstairs sittingroom, which served also as a dining room and partial bedroom, with another small bedroom adjoining. And there was a precious English garden enclosed by a wall, at the rear of the house. The place was owned by two spinster sisters who insisted on marketing, cooking and washing up. The tasteful English food was served in covered dishes delivered to our door each mealtime, with the necessary plates and silver. No<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-391" title="391"></span> shopping for groceries - no cooking - no washing dishes! Imagine the wave of luxury that came over our hard-working mother and how she blossomed into increased loveliness under this release from care.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father enrolled at Christs College - one of the many in that educational city of renown. There were few afternoons following his classes that he did not take us through some part of the venerable quaintness of Old Oxford: Green lawns stretching everywhere with trees and shrubs in abundance, leaves just turning their color, and a profusion of flowers that fairly took our breaths away; a lazy river winding its way through, on which we sometimes rowed; parks inhabited by bushy-tailed squirrels and small tame deer; horse-drawn streetcars on which we occasionally rode; interesting and quaint shops, book stalls and stores, collectors dreams, in which we often browsed; and old, sometimes crumbling vine-covered churches whose musty-smelling doors were always open and into which we never failed to enter.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime, back in Zion, Laurs and Else were ready to leave for Denmark at last. They had secured and thoroughly investigated literature and instructions pertaining to a journey of this kind.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Passports were not required to secure admission to Denmark, but they were useful or necessary as a means of identification, or in proof of citizenship. They should be exhibited wherever evidence of citizenship was required. Since Laurs had never served in the military in Denmark, and although he was now far too old for such service and besides had been a naturalized American citizen for well over thirty years, having declared his intentions to become one 2nd Aug. 1875, in the First Judicial District Court of the United States in Provo, Utah, still he had no mind to take any chances in Old Denmark. So he applied for and secured his passport, which came with the following “NOTICE: The person to whom this passport is issued is hereby directed to affix his signature<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-392" title="392"></span> thereon, in the space designated, immediately upon its receipt… etc… etc… American citizens who expect to make a prolonged stay in any foreign country should apply for consular registration to the American Consulate in that country… P. C. Knox - Dept. of State, Washington, April 11, 1910.” Else of course had her passport from before.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The couple had arranged to travel from Salt Lake City with a group of Europe-bound missionaries, two of whom were going to Denmark, Elders John Elmer Larsen of Tabor, Canada, and Hans Sanders of Salt Lake City. They had received their letters of instructions which read as follows:— “INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITORS WHO ACCOMPANY THE EUROPEAN PARTY LEAVING JULY 13th…Your train leaves Oregon Shortline Depot 5:15 p.m, Wednesday:— The Oregon Short Line Ry. to Ogden; the Union Pacific Ry. to Omaha, the Chicago Great Western Ry. Omaha to Chicago. Your rail ticket is all in one ticket for the entire party between Salt Lake and Chicago, and is held by the Elder in charge of the company. If you have a trunk to check you should be at the Oregon Short Line depot baggage room not later than 4 p.m. Wednesday. The Elder in charge has an order to get your rail ticket from Chicago to Montreal that is paid for, and you hold your own steamship ticket. The large new steamer “Megantic” that you go on, sails from Montreal at daybreak Saturday the 23rd, and passengers sleep on board the steamer the night before. Liverpool address; Durham House, 295 Edge Lane, Liverpool, England.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else had procured a small notebook in which she copied addresses, any genealogical information she happened across, and a sort of day by day account of their travels, and from this we copy:— “Left our home in Manti on the 9th of July (1910); left Salt Lake City on the 13th; came to Omaha on the 15th; came to Chicago on the 16th; left there on the 17th July; came to Buffalo on the 18th; came to Montreal, Canada on the 19th of July, going on the ship the evening of the 22nd July.” This was Laurs’ sixty-third birthday and he may have recalled the last time he was in Canada, which was exactly forty-four years before, when<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-393" title="393"></span> they rode the abominable cattle cars on their way to Zion in 1866 as newly arrived Danish emigrants. In fact it was in Montreal that they had first boarded those filthy boxcars. Laurs had spent his nineteenth birthday those many years ago crossing over from Canada into the United States. Who would have dreamed then that he would return again to Montreal? Neither could they know now that the day before, 21 July 1910, brother Mads’ dear wife Else had passed away in Denmark. The two sisters-in-law named Else would never meet again in this life, or would Laurs ever meet Mads’ wife, as he’d expected, but the others of his wife’s kin by the grace of heaven he would soon see - and also Christen, his only living full brother! Can we imagine the stirring of his emotions as he thought upon these meetings?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now continuing Else’s account of their journey:— “We started to sail the morning of the 23rd July, on the ship S. S. Megantic; came to Liverpool 30 July; crossed over from England to Grimby on the lst of August on the ship Vicaria; came to Esbjerg on the west coast of Jutland on the 3rd of August in the morning; came to Thisted the same day in the afternoon.” Here at Thisted they must have been met by some of Else’s folks from nearby Thorsted, perhaps Mikkel Skaarup, who had come for Else before. And when they had come to the village of Thorsted perhaps the flags were flying again to greet them, for this was the Danish way to celebrate. And what a family reunion and festival that must have been, though surely somewhat tempered by the grief that still clung to them because of Mads’ wife’s passing. And what wonderful days those must have been that followed, with all four sisters, their companions and brother Mads together, along with all the nieces and nephews who could manage to be there for the welcoming of their Aunt Else and Uncle Laurs from America. That “Uncle Laurs” fit right in with the crowd can well be imagined, for with his good natured disposition, kindliness and rare diplomacy, not to mention his ever ready Danish wit, he must have won them all over, both the Old Ones and the young.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-394" title="394"></span>But Laurs and Else were not the only ones from the Mormon state who were traveling to Denmark at the time. President Joseph F. Smith, his wife and son and Presiding Bishop Charles W. Nibley, his wife and two daughters, had arrived in Copenhagen July 27th and were in the process of visiting many of the various branches in the Mission, including the one at Aalborg. They were being accompanied by Andrew Jenson, then President of the Mission. These brethren from Zion spoke to capacity audiences wherever they visited and Brother Jenson showed slides and pictures of outstanding places in Mormondom. It was a most successful missionary venture on the part of these brethren, according to former Church Historian, Andrew Jenson, and the Danish and Norwegian newspapers published many favorable comments on the same, although there were others who railed against them. This was said to be the first time in history that either a President or a Presiding Bishop of the L. D. S. Church had visited in Scandinavia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The publicity given these L. D. S. Authorities doubtless made it somewhat easier for Laurs, in his kind way, to try and open up friendly conversations on the subject of religion, as if the way had been paved by a higher power. Nevertheless, even though Jutland Danes were seldom silent and usually began each sentence with a “Ja” or a “Nej” and ended each question with an “eh”, yet when the Gospel and its principles were mentioned there were never any “Jas”, “Nejs!”-or “ehs”, only silence. So how in the world could Laurs, Else or anyone else tell what was on their minds then? It was a bit discouraging to the would-be missionaries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet the welcome given the two by Else’s people was warm and sincere in every other respect; and who can say no sparks of truth were lighted there? After a few days of it in Thorsted, Laurs and Else were on their way again, going south from Thisted by train to visit numbers of other relatives, as Else wrote in her notebook:— “Came to Hurup on 9th Aug. to Salmon Sorensen’s my brother Mads’ daughter Valborg’s place; came to Christen “Flarups” the 10th of Aug. A.M, at<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-395" title="395"></span> Nessum by Hurup.”<sup class="calibre11" id="fnref:9"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:9">9</a></sup> Christen Flarup was the name they called Laurs’ brother Christen Christensen, but whether it was merely a nickname or whether he had assumed this name by then we know not. So it was here that the two brothers were reunited after forty-four years of separation, but whether this, their last meeting on earth, was all Laurs had hoped for aside from the aspect of religion, we are uncertain. As far as the Gospel was concerned, however, we have been told that his mission here was unsuccessful, for Christen would have none of it! But strange as it may seem, one of his two daughters later joined the L. D. S. Church there in Denmark, according to Aunt Sarah Christensen’s understanding.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Genealogical gatherings were interspersed among the travel entries in Eise’s notebook, and according to these they must have visited relatives in Kjallerup, where she was born; Hvidbjerg Western, where she was christened a Lutheran; Bedsted (Bested) where she was baptized a Mormon; Kobberod where grandfather Laurs was born; Gettrup where his mother was born, and other places dear to their youths. Even though Else’s “day-by-day” account does not list these places, her genealogical gleanings jotted down at the time do. After two days spent with Laurs’ brother Christen, they parted from him and went on their way as follows;— “Going to Laurs’ cousins, Thomas (Nielsen) Wies from Nessum the 12th of Aug.; today the 19th Aug. evening - we are here in Tolbol with my cousin, Sidsel Marie Hvid (Madsen) and family; today is the 5th of Sept. - We are at the home of Mr. Svend Kirkagade; today is the 8th Sept. - we are now in Skive with Laurs’ cousin, Peter Kvisgaard Poulsen (wife and one child), at 2 o’clock we will go on the water to Hvalpsund on the way to Nibe.” Laurs made some notes of his own regarding this part of their journey in a small memorandum book, in this manner:— “From Struer 9:22. In Skive 10:32 (here lives a son of Jens Kr. Poulsen, railroad assistant P. Poulsen.) From Skive with motorboat to Hvalpsund; In Nibe 6:39 - in Nibe lives Jens Kr. Poulsen’s daughter-in-law, flower trader (florist), Signe Poulsen, from there to Grydsted School.”<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-396" title="396"></span> We continue Else’s account:— “Going to Aalborg 17th Sept. 1910. We are here in Aalborg 17th Sept, in this good home with some loving saints, Christen Pedersen and wife Kirstine Marie; Mrs, Marie Carlsen, 679 E, Jensen Ave., Salt Lake City, her father and mother live here in Aalborg - we must see them here and also go to L. D. S. Church headquarters here in Aalborg, at Borupsgade 12. Going back to Thisted tomorrow. In Aarhus the 20 Sept. in the home of Peter Forgesen Fisher, father and mother of Willardsen’s wife Marie of Centerfield - also had word from her Aunt Anne. “Kobenhaven” 30 Sept. 1910, will see Hans Mortensen’s girls here today.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So it seems Laurs and Else traveled from one end of Little Denmark to the other visiting their relatives, both close and distant, and also calling on relatives of friends back in Zion; and as they traveled to and fro the list of names and vital statistics of families they visited enroute grew and grew in Else’s notebook. Sometime during their journey Else contacted a professional genealogist by the name of Jens C. Nielsen, and engaged him to search out the records of her noble progenitors, the Hvids - way back. Perhaps this was one of the things that took them to Copenhagen then as well as their desire to visit the L. D. S. headquarters there and greet mission president, Andrew Jenson, whom they had known so well since they traveled together on “Old Kenilworth”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here one now saw ten bicycles to every motorcar and at noons or days ends the ratio was higher. Old-fashioned church gables still zigzagged on the sky, where they stood with their red tile roofs, high white walls, and copings bright around them like red ruffles. Perhaps Laurs and Else stood with all the people in the public square there and sang “There is a Lovely Land”, as the band played it. It was more popular with the Danes then than “King Christian”. They had added a new verse to it lately, something about “Denmark shall never fall as long as there are blue waters lapping on the shores of her green islands.” But in spite of all the “new” this homeland of theirs would always be old, for even before the fierce old Vikings there had been a Denmark!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-397" title="397"></span> Then Laurs and Else must have written Andrew and Sarah at 81 Coroly (or Corohy) road, Oxford, England (the address was in Else’s notebook) to inform them that they woul be returning to Thisted in Jutland the forepart of October and to meet them there then, and, according to cousin Edythe’s history, this is what Andrew and his family did:— “Sometime in late fall we left the idyll of Oxford for the province of Thisted, Denmark - home of our paternal ancestors. The route was via the North Sea. It was only an over-night trip but, from the moment movement began in the hold of the ship until sometime after landing, I experienced the sensation of having my head lifted from my body, then of being woosily dropped from a very high place. Again, mother, Sheldon and I took to our beds and stayed there. From the port of landing we traveled by train and ferry. The ferry boats were usually constructed with railway ties and holds sufficient to load the train intact on the boat, passengers and all, ferry it across and then release the train to speed on its way until the process was repeated again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We found father’s parents with the relatives, as per schedule. I don’t know how much genealogy had been accumulated by Grandfather and Grandmother but all attempts to interest the relatives in the Gospel were foiled. They were adament. The “red carpet” was extended and kept bright as long as “Mormonism” was kept under cover. We were dined and plied with extra refreshments until mother finally cried “halt!” She could take no more rich pastries nor cream thickened hot chocolate (substitute for coffee), and pled for watered-down milk and plain crusts of bread.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At last relatives and our beloved grandparents were bidden a fond adieu as father headed his little family toward Germany and school. From Copenhagen we went by water to Hamburg, then by train to the capitol, Berlin. Kaiser Wilhelm II was then in his prime. Father arranged a visit to the Berlin palace and a parade of the Kaiser’s goose-stepping troops - the elite guard - in review. These fairly gleamed in their bright uniformed, white-gloved spit and polish. At the entrance of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-398" title="398"></span> the palace we took off our shoes, tied on flannel substitutes, and were guided over polished floors that shone as mirrors, reflecting the crystal-studded chandeliers as well as the many mirrored panels that slit the hardwood or taspestry bedecked walls. (The Emperor’s ambitious glory was to be short-lived however, from then on.) From here, again by train, we reached our destination - the fine old University city of Leipsig.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Possibly one of Laurs and Else’s last acts before they bid a last farewell to her people and left Thisted for their home in America was to visit once more the village of Norhaa and one of the spots most dear to Else’s heart. We have reason to believe that they found the dwelling where she once lived in ruins. The churchyard cemetery where her parents were buried must have been visited as well, which must have called up fondest memories of her childhood and youth, together with a feeling of deep emotion at the thoughts of never being able to visit there again. But let Else herself tell of some of her feelings then, for she put them in verse. (These verses have undoubtedly lost much in translation from the Danish but we have done the best we could.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“O Denmark, O Denmark, thou art my Birthland<br class="calibre4"/> Now long years have vanished since I saw your strand.<br class="calibre4"/> Here stood father’s dwelling near the lake’s wooded shore<br class="calibre4"/> But now it is gone - we shall see it no more.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“O here was our garden with mother’s flower bed<br class="calibre4"/> But I see not the rose that once bloomed so red<br class="calibre4"/> And gone is the bench where Rudolph and I<br class="calibre4"/> Sat and listened so oft to the nightengale’s cry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In Old Denmark here have I yet family,<br class="calibre4"/> Therefore I came back just for them to see<br class="calibre4"/> And I offer a prayer on this far-away strand<br class="calibre4"/> That someday they’ll follow me to Zion’s land.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“A wreath have I laid on this dear hallowed ground<br class="calibre4"/> On this grave where my mother in death was laid down.<br class="calibre4"/> Then farewell to all who hold her name dear,<br class="calibre4"/> For ship’s bells are calling - we shall meet no more here.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">—Else K. Christensen</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-399" title="399"></span> (A copy was sent to Louis D. Christensen, 21 Apr. 1912.)</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">In Thisted they secured a “Haandbog for 3 Klasse” from one P. Andersen, and then it was back to Copenhagen for them again, by train and ferry. Here they mailed a few letters of thanks back to their loved ones in Jutland and sent along a few gifts of money to the nieces who had been so helpful during their visit. Then they sailed away from Old Denmark and her green islands about mid-October 1910, on one of the big ocean liners owned by the “Scandinavian-Amerika Linie”. This should have been a fine trip for Laurs and Else since neither of them ever suffered from seasickness, having been raised to the lullaby rhythm of the sound of the sea. However, they were plagued by a shortage of money, doubtless having overspent a bit “putting on airs” in Denmark that they could hardly afford; though it must have been well worth it to be able to impress their kinfolk there. If Else was inclined to fret about it Laurs probably smoothed things over with a shrug and some comment such as:— “Well, better to be poor and right than to be poor and wrong”, having in mind their Danish relatives utter lack of interest in the Gospel, as well as their modest circumstances.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It took nine days to cross over and, upon docking in New York City, the two found it necessary to telegraph home for additional money with which to continue their westward journey. While they waited, uncertain about the outcome, they likely busied themselves writing cards and letters, not only to their many children but to their Danish loved ones as well to let them know of their safe arrival in the U. S. A., and probably adding a postscript about being found financially embarrassed in New York, and of course making a joke of it. But it must have been no joke to be found so. Cousin Byron Peterson remembers his mother, Emma, telling about receiving an urgent request for help from her stranded parents in New York, and of hurrying down to the Gunnison telegraph office to wire them some money. In her haste, however, Emma stumbled and fell in the<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-400" title="400"></span> dusty street near the office and dropped the precious money she had held in her hand. When she recovered herself and the coins, a twenty dollar gold piece was missing. Bystanders, seeing her plight, helped to hunt and finally brought a sieve and sifted the dirt all around where she had fallen until they found the gold piece.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Returning to their own state the last of that October, Laurs and Else must have viewed with joy the Rocky Mountains and all the other familiar sights and sounds that said “this is home”. They must have stopped off a few days to visit Chris and family in Salt Lake City, for there was so much to tell! Then they must have hurried back to Manti in time to cast their vote, for it was important to them to assist in electing representatives who would support Republican President William Howard Taft. Elvena, Albert and family would have been on hand to greet them at Manti, where they had just moved into Albert’s and Jennie’s lovely new home there on Depot Street (now 195 West 1st North). Previously that fall, while the new house was being finished, Vena had been taking care of three of Albert’s children in Old Man Henry’s rock house next door, while Jennie had been at her father, Joseph Snow’s house, quarantined in with Elaine there, she having taken scarlet fever. Remembering Chris and Caroline’s sad loss of that spring, Jennie and Albert had taken no chances with this dreaded disease. Albert, Judge of the Seventh Judicial District, had been staying at the hotel when he could be in Manti, but now they were all settled and together again; and Vena was happy to have her parents back so they could all get settled again too.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Letters from Denmark were awaiting Laurs and Else upon their return - it was good to know that they were fondly remembered in Thorsted:—</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thorsted, Oct, 24, 1910</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Aunt and Uncle:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Greetings from Denmark! Then you are already now on the long journey homeward bound for your land far away. I guess it has to be like that - but we can hear from each other. Receive<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-401" title="401"></span> my heartiest thanks for your visit - I like you! I missed you so much the first few days, I almost believe it was because of the dear little children who kept me so busy. I wonder how things are for them in Germany? And you, Dear Uncle, with your good humor which you have preserved throughout all the many years you have lived over there - yes and preserved the language too. Thanks for what you sent me. I will buy something for it that I can keep as lasting memories of those days. But I think it far too much for I was glad to be able to do a little bit for you.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Yesterday I took a trip by bike out to Aunt Marie’s. I brought greetings to her from your letter. She said she was longing so dearly to get to know when you were coming back here to live - or so she said. Oh but I get tired of her ways for so often she talks so much and it is not always wisdom that she speaks it seems to me. I believe that Aunt Else will understand what I mean. I hope you are well on the ship - I wonder how far you are right now? I know that wherever you are you have a dome-shaped sky above you.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Aunt, when I am sitting all alone, as now at this moment, so many thoughts and questions come to me. I often feel like him who said ‘The good things I intend to do I do not but the evil I didn’t intend to do, I do’. Yes, we are all weak people and since we can do nothing for ourselves, all is spoiled for us - everything must be given us from above. Dear relatives, we are of different outlooks on life - you miss that with us. Thanks Aunt Else for the words in your letter saying that you do not judge us. We must believe that everyone who has a faith and lives his life according to it, will find his way home to the Father’s House on high, by Jesus Christ. Now dears, you must forgive me for what I have said if you find it a little strange of me. I express myself very badly and imperfect I know, but the quietness around me always calls out deep thoughts and living longings of the heart - ‘Business weakens, quietness awakens.’ Goodby and thanks for everything good. Hearty greetings to Elvena and loving greeting to you from your niece, Maren Skaarup.”<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-402" title="402"></span> “Thorsted, Denmark 28 Oct, 1910</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Friends in the Distance:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thanks very much for the letter, it came in good condition. We hope that when these few words reach you that you are back in your daily routine again and safely home. Now you have a lot to think about since you have been in so many different homes recently. There are so many impressions to be received through travel. Here we are very thankful that all went so well while you were away. You asked, dear sister, how goes it with the Skaarups? It was so strange that you should ask, especially at this time during Mikkel’s dark period (illness). Trouble is not something unknown to me, but I must thank the good God Father for both the light and the dark and for everything we lack. I know for certain that we do not always thrive best with wind (under good circumstances). I could just about say that the only wish I have is that Mikkel, and all of us, could be free of our ailments but we must admit that, as Paul says, ‘we have a thorn in the flesh’. I hope you, dear sister, can understand my thoughts. I can truthfully say that Mikkel has been a good husband, and a good father to all of our children. But I can tell that we are getting older and we sometimes have to have things hard to get us to be humble and make us like little children for our God Father, who both can and will help us. I am so grateful at least that my leg is better.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Day before yesterday we had the threshers here. You should have seen the bunch of grain we had. Brother Mads was here to help. I promised to send you a greeting from him and also one from Svend Poulsen. Stine is not yet completely moved to Thorsted but hopes that it will be shortly. Maren has written to you so I think I had better quit at this time. Herewith I will wish God’s peace be with us all. We were so happy for your visit. I am supposed to say ‘hello’ to you from our children who are away. Yours, Mikkel and Karen Skaarup.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was also a letter enclosed from<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-403" title="403"></span> Mikkel’s and Karen’s son Christian, The “Marie” he refers to was his new wife. (Translation)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thorsted, 28 Oct, 1910 “Dear Aunt and Family:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I feel it’s my duty to protest against Marie’s coverage of me concerning my inner personality because there she plainly exaggerates to a high degree. The judgment she gives is such that it is dependent upon the eyes with which it is seen and I don’t believe that her sight is completely unobstructed. But I’m not so smart a doctor that I can cure her but will leave it to time who doctors all mistakes, it is said.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have a friend of my youth among the Mormons, Peder Christen Gertsen, do you know him? If so I would appreciate it if you would say ‘hello’ to him for me. He visited me here in Vesløs some years ago. He has a brother over there, Lars Christen Gertsen, who he said had become a free thinker, perhaps you know him also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I hope that our common Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, God the Father’s only born son, has many mansions and also a prepared place for you with your dear husband and children. I have the impression that you are a courageous and God-devoted woman. Here on the earth there are, funny as it may seem, so many distinct parties with different beliefs, many of whom think that they alone are God’s true disciples.

  <p class="calibre1">“Marie desires me to request a complete description of your travel home, and especially when you stood in America flabbergasted for want of money. Marie also suggests that I should let you know that I am really happy with her. So I will herewith add that she, my big baby - for so she is - is more interested that the work goes easy for her both in and out of the house. I wish to be a good husband for her just as she, my own big darling, also desires to be and is a good wife<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-404" title="404"></span> to me. God bless her and God bless us all! I’m supposed to send greetings to you from the Lars M. Christensens, Aunt Marie and husband, and hearty greetings from your nephew - Christian Skaarup.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So, they wouldn’t talk about religion when Laurs and Else were there - but they could write about it now when there was less chance for rebuttal! Perhaps then they had set their Danish kinfolk to thinking, after all. Who then could say that no seed of truth had been sown among them there?</p>
