  <p class="calibre1">So many have participated in remembering. In her memoirs Aunt Elsie tells of her father:— “While father could not do heavy work in his later years, he did his share in caring for the home whenever mother was away. He held many positions of trust in early day Gunnison. After the railroad came to the valley he was freight collector for a number of the mercantile establishments, including the co-op store where he was also watchman for many years. He also hauled freight to Manti and other areas. He was a school trustee for years too. He eventually held the office of High Priest in the church, being ordained to this office on 7 Aug. 1904, and in the early part of the twentieth century was called to receive a special blessing in the Manti Temple because of his faithfulness in his calling in the priesthood. Our home was a happy and congenial one and father was especially kind. He never lost his temper. Both father and mother were devout people, busy raising and providing for their large family but always giving help to neighbors or wherever help was needed, practicing honesty in their dealings with man and God.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia remembers how grandfather used to run races with the children and walk on his hands to entertain them. Some of his grandchildren recall how he used to perch them on his foot or knee and bounce them up and down in ride-a-cock-horse fashion to the rhythm of a Danish rhyme he chanted, “Ride, ride ranke - hesten hedder Blanke - føllet hedder Abilgraa - og den skal lille Harold ride paa” and then he’d toss the rider high with much merry laughter; and whether it was Harold, Elmer, Roy, A. Owen, Lucien, Wendell, Byron, or one of the little girls who rode, each always clamored for more. Sometimes he pulled in fun at the children’s fingers, one by one, as he tried to teach them the Danish names for each - Tommel-tot, Slikkepot, Langemand, Guldbrand and Lille Peder Spillemand. Yes, grandpa Laurs always<span id="page-357"></span> seemed to have time for the children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia remembers that after she gave up her public medical practice, grandmother Else took boarders. The builders who put up the first brick homes in Gunnison were among them. Tresia says, “Your grandmother could cook if she needed to, but she liked community service and church work better. She was always very active in the Relief Society. She kept her own garden, which grandfather ploughed and helped plant, and she took care of the chickens and geese. Each spring she plucked the geese to fill her pillows and each newly married couple in the family got a pair of those pillows for their wedding. She spent her egg money with care. Each fall after threshing she put new fresh straw in the bed-ticks and under the rugs as well. She had a large loom and wove rugs and carpets and was a great quilter, though she wasn’t much for fine sewing. Piecing, tying or quilting quilts and tearing and sewing rag rugs was a never-ending process with her. Your grandfather raised the sheep and she helped shear them (she could shear a sheep as good as any man), washed and carded the wool and made it into batts for the quilts or spun it into yarn and dyed it for stockings, of which she made legions. How I hated to wear those black, itchy stockings!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia also remembers that Aunt Roxie did all of grandmother’s sewing for years, after she and Joseph were married. She made all of grandmother’s dresses then and those for Vena and Tresia. There was always a new dress for the girls for Christmas. She remembers that Millie Gledhill from down the street worked for grandma when she took boarders, and Bell Wasden from across the road did too. Tresia recalls how grandmother used to like to have her hair combed by Elsie, Emma, Vena or Tresia. During some of her few idle moments she would fall to sleep and nap in her chair while one or the other of them combed or brushed her long hair. It was such a beautiful head of waist-length auburn hair, slightly streaked with grey then, and she wore it in heavy braids wrapped into a bob on top of her head, pinned up with large hairpins and amber<span id="page-358"></span> colored hair combs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia remembers what “cut-ups” Louis and Arthur were, but especially Lou, who at times seemed to be full of the “Old Nick” himself. Tresia was mostly on to their tricks but the trusting Vena, ever free from guile, often bore the brunt of their mischief. Like the time the two boys had, for some misdeed, received their usual punishment of being sent to bed without their supper. This is related by Elaine, as told to her by Aunt Vena:— “The boys induced Vena to dress up like a ‘poor child’ and go to their mother with a story about a family of starving children watched over by a sick widow - the lines were well rehearsed beforehand - ‘and could you, dear Sister Christensen, please spare a little bread and milk for them?’ Else, the soul of charity, fixed up a tasty supper which was to have been duly taken up the back stairs to the waiting brothers. But then Vena giggled and her mother, seeing the whole thing in a nut shell, brought her hand down with a spat on Vena’s back part and she was hustled off to bed in disgrace for contributing to the delinquency of her older brothers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elaine remembers other things Aunt Vena told her:— “There was the time her ‘dear brothers’ put her down the well where she was supposed to hide for a game and then went off and forgot to bring her back up. And there was the time when Lou and Arthur induced her to lie in the ditch (in place of the bridge) and scare grandmother when she came up to the corral at evening to feed swill to the pigs. Else came with a full bucket in each hand, as scheduled but unforeseen by Vena, and before the girl could yell out to scare her stepped right on her stomach, which threw them both into a fright and upset the buckets, drenching Vena in watery garbage. Then there was the time when Vena had saved up eggs enough to buy a coveted blouse. Carrying the eggs in a basket and accompanied by grandmother, she went carefully up the weed-bordered sidewalk toward town. As they came to a wooden bridge spanning an irrigation ditch, they stepped simultaneously on a loose board. Vena, who weighed less than grandmother, flew into the air and landed on, in and under the<span id="page-359"></span> ill-fated eggs.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ruth Ellen remembers her mother Roxie telling about the good soup grandmother Else used to make. “She would cook up a big pot of it - a soup bone, plenty of vegetables and spices and Danish dumplings. About the time the family was ready to sit down to eat, grandmother would remember that ‘Old Sister Hansen would like a taste of this soup’ and dispatch Louis or Arthur to Sister Hansen’s with some in a small lard bucket. Then she’d recall that ‘Brother Nielsen might like some nice hot soup’ and she’d send the other boy off in the direction of Brother Nielson’s with another small pail of soup. By the time the large family sat down for soup there was hardly enough left to satisfy the hearty appetites. Truly grandmother was the soul of generosity.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia remembers when the tall, dark and handsome Swede, Charles Peter Peterson, came courting the dark-haired, rosy-cheeked Emma. He came in a smart one-seated rig and brought her box after box of chocolates which she passed around and then put carefully away in her bureau drawer. Like little mice, Tresia and Vena would stealthily help themselves to the bonbons, one after another; but if Emma knew, she was too sweet and too much in love to lose her temper about it. Charles drove Emma to the Manti Temple in that selfsame rig, Wed. 30 Sept. 1903, to be married. That evening her parents entertained family, neighbors and friends at a wedding supper at their home in Gunnison. Emma was twenty-six then and Charles was twenty-five, but once every year he caught up with her for one month and two days during June and July. Charles had a house all ready for his bride on property he owned one mile east of Gunnison. They called the place the “Bar Double C Ranch”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie Gledhill’s younger sister, Mary G. Dowdle, remembers that the Gledhill and the Christensen girls were playmates in the early days, and always the best of friends. How the neighbor children loved to go to Grandma Christensen’s. She always had some little treat for them - cookies, buns or Danish pastries of some<span id="page-360"></span> sort. When older the two youngest Gledhill girls, Mary and Sylvia, did a lot of singing together and were considered very good for that time. They sang “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” and “Whispering Hope” in that part of the country for the first time they were sung there. Millie also did some public entertaining with them on occasions. At one time Vena Christensen was “Goddess of Liberty” at one of those wonderful small town Fourth of July celebrations they used to have down there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie’s younger brother Albert (Bert) Gledhill, whose mother died when he was in his teens, writes of “Grandpa and Grandma” Christensen:— “I say Grandpa and Grandma because they were to me just that - and the only ones I ever knew. Enough could never be said about the good they did. Anyone who needed could always get a good meal and bed from them. They helped me in many ways. May I remind you that Grandma was the only medical help we had in Gunnison for a long time, and how well I do remember that she ran a spoon down my throat every other day all one winter. Grandpa and Grandma Christensen gave me, as they did many others, a home when I had no place else to go. May God bless the memory of those two wonderful people is a prayer in my heart - and right now a tear in my eye.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During the early days in Gunnison Grandpa and Grandma kept a boardinghouse and my sister Millie worked for Grandma, helping with the housework and cooking. Of course this brought Arthur Marinus Christensen and Millie Jane Gledhill together in courtship.” Indeed, the two were courting even while Arthur was attending school at Brigham Young Academy in Provo, for love will find a way! A letter written by Arthur to Millie, who was visiting her aunt in Santaquin, Utah, near Provo at the time, indicates this fact:— Feb, 17, 1902 My Dear Millie:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Your kind and welcome letter of the 13th was received, and I can assure you that it was read with pleasure. I just came from meeting. They dedicated the new building today (Training School),<span id="page-361"></span> The President of the Church, Joseph F. Smith, and a number ofthe Apostles were down. There is going to be a Grand Ball tonight but I do not think I will go as I am so weak it is hard for me to get around. Sorensons have it that I have the diphtheria down here and that I got it from you. I dare not go up to Cornelias (Sorenson) anymore as I might give them the diphtheria (ha ha). Edmund Sanders is down here, he said that nearly all the flags are taken down in Gunnison. (Quarantine flags for diphtheria.) It looks like storm here now - makes me feel quite lonesome for I’m all alone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Well dear, I guess if you cannot speak above a whisper you cannot talk to me from where you are. You must write soon and let me know when you are going home. You must not think that it was staying up late that made me sick, for I think it is the warm weather. Did you have a good time at the dance? I did not say I was out until morning Saturday night. Did I not say Friday night? And that was the night I was down to Broadbent’s with you. You know I got lost there by the grove and then got stuck in the mud and had to wait until it was light before I could get out. Louis bought John Wasden’s place so I guess he will be my neighbor now. I am going to stay here until Saturday or Sunday and if I am not better by that time I will board the train for home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Katie went home Saturday for the wedding of Bell and Erick - I suppose you know Otto and Jennette are married. Wish I was in Santaquin - would make your Aunt Lizzie, as you call her, wait a long time if she was going to wait up for you. Well dearest, write soon and then the next time I write you I will know for sure when I am going home. From your own true, Arthur, 333 East 5th North St. Provo, Utah. (Old David Jones home.)” Then Arthur added a hand drawn sketch of a bird flying with a heart in its mouth, on which he wrote the words “Love to Millie.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Millie’s and Arthur’s courtship led to marriage, Millie’s sister remembers this:— “When Arthur and Millie were married they went to the Manti Temple, Wed. 3 Feb. 1904. Millie<span id="page-362"></span> turned twenty-two twenty-three days later. She was nearly five months older than Arthur. A wedding reception was held that night at our home and, as was the custom, a big dinner was served to all the guests. The couple first lived in a small house two doors east of Grandpa and Grandma Christensen’s but, when mother died not too much later, they moved west into our home so that Millie could help care for father and us younger Gledhill children.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandmother Christensen often had her own troubles. Tresia remembers that at one time she and grandfather had gone to a show at the Opera House there in Gunnison. Upon returning home in the dark, by the Co-op store, she ran into a tie post and cut her forehead and a bad infection set in, which they called Erysipelas. This was an acute infectious disease of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by some kind of streptococcus and was accompanied by inflamation and fever. Grandmother had quite a time of it. At another period she was afflicted with some sort of stomach trouble and couldn’t stand to drink either water or milk, nor could she digest her food without much distress and pain. She lived for months eating nothing much but clabbered milk, or “thick milk” as she called it. At another time she injured her foot so that she could not bear her weight upon it. But she kept right on working around the house, moving back and forth kneeling with one leg on a chair. It seems she seldom gave in to pain or self pity, though she was the soul of pity for others who suffered.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greater pain is usually caused by seeing ones own children or loved ones suffer or by seeing them indulge themselves in practices that are harmful or degrading to them. When children are young, a mother can say “no” to them and it can mean the same as her saying “I love you”, for they must be taught self-discipline and of course child-hood is the place to begin this training. As children grow older, parents can seldom teach or govern them by saying “no!” But life is like a mirror and children grow to adulthood with the lessons of their<span id="page-363"></span> childhood reflected in their adult lives. I never remember seeing any of my Christensen uncles or my father smoking, nor did my grandfather Christensen use the harmful and obnoxious weed. Of course the gentler sex never smoked in those days, as far as I know. But most of the boys must have tried it at one time or another for that seemed to be the thing to do. In Albert’s recollections he tells of his “try”:— “Some of my group - I cannot remember their names - were trying to imitate the older boys they knew who smoked. I somehow thought I would try this experiment so I bought a sack of Bull Durham and a package of cigarette paper and proceeded home with the intention of learning the art. Somehow I didn’t even think of hiding it from my mother, who was working about the house and yard. I did remember that she had said in my hearing that she hoped her boys would never be seen with a cigar in their mouths. Well, when I was in the act of rolling my first cigarette my mother came along and observed what I was about to do. The look on her face was so sad that it startled me. She said, “Albert, are you going to smoke?” Tears came to her eyes and she turned away. The look on her face struck me with shocking force. I took the Durham and the paper and threw them into the irrigation ditch. Mother never mentioned the subject thereafter but I never thought of smoking again.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl remembers her father Chris telling about his experience with smoking:— “Being out with the sheep so much he had taken up the habit of smoking. One day he ran out of smokes and the craving for one became so intense he could hardly bear it. He was alone in the mountains far from any other place or sheep-camp and could not leave his own herd. He said he felt he would go mad if he couldn’t have a smoke. Then he thought of the dying campfire - perhaps he could find the unused butt of one in that! Quickly he knelt down by the heap of ashes and began pawing frantically through them in search of a cigarette butt. All of a sudden, in his mind’s eye, he stood up and viewed himself as he crouched there groveling around in the ashes and soot like a wild animal. Utterly ashamed, he got up from his knees and vowed then and there<span id="page-364"></span> that from that time forward he would never again be a slave and stoop to such a filthy habit. And he never smoked again.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was often music at the Christensens. Elsie and Emma had each taken some musical instruction at Snow College and again at B. Y. A. Laurs had bought a piano for the home, and both the older girls played it quite well, especially Elsie. Vena also taught herself to play a little. Louis and Arthur learned to chord on the piano and the banjo. Both of them also had good voices, as the older girls did, but especially Lou. Tresia remembers when the two boys sang in the ward choir together there in Gunnison. Pearl remembers that her father often sang at his work and what a very good voice he had, though it was untrained. Grandma Else usually sang or hummed at her work, her rich contralto softly keeping time with her beating or stirring, as she moved from table to stove in the process of her cooking, or with the movement of her body as she scrubbed the dirty clothes up and down on the washboard. Always she hummed at her weaving and quilting, sewing and knitting. Often she sang in Danish what must have been “King Christian” or “There is a Lovely Land”. But she sang hymns too in her own special English. I can still hear in memory one of her favorites, as she used to sing and hum it intermittently:— “Guide us Oh Thou Great Jehovah…Guide us to the Promised Land… We are weak but thou art able, hold us with thy powerful hand… When the earth begins to tremble, bid our fearful thoughts be still… When thy judgment spreads destruction, keep us safe on Zions hill… Holy Spirit… feed us till the Savior comes… Great Redeemer… Bring, O bring, the welcome day.” Grandmother used V’s for W’s, T’s for D’s, D’s for T’s and Y’s for J’s in her own special brand of English - and how I loved to hear her sing or speak as she did with such fervor. Grandfather appreciated music too, but I think he loved to dance to it more than sing. In truth, all the Christensens enjoyed music. President David O. McKay once referred to good music as a power that “gentles the human animal”. Might we not call it the rainbow that bridges earth with heaven?<span id="page-365"></span> It was perhaps in midsummer of 1904 that the son Andrew left for more advanced study in Europe. Laurs and Else must have been extremely excited about this for he planned to visit their relatives in Denmark first, before going to enroll for classes in Germany. Else in particular must have loaded him down with the addresses of her people and “many loving greetings” to give them, as well as plenty of advice about the necessity of gathering as much genealogical information as possible while he visited in Jutland. He was, of course, urged to call on his father’s brother Christen and his two daughters, his wife now being dead. But in all instances he must have been cautioned not to mention the Gospel in an outright manner lest he offend his Lutheran relatives and wear out his welcome oversoon. Andrew B. arrived in Jutland, Denmark as scheduled and was welcomed with much warmth by his Danish kin, especially Else’s people with whom he spent a number of happy days. They were much impressed with their nephew and cousin “Anders”, as they cailed him, if the reports in their letters back to Laurs and Else were any indication. But Andrew’s advanced study in Germany that followed did not fare as well, for it was unexpectedly interrupted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Andrew had left Sarah and the three children, seven-and-a-half year old Adelbert, four year old Edith and one year old Wendell, comfortably situated in a rented home in Prove, Utah. Edith tells of this in her own history:— “Mother was living in Provo, Utah. Two of her younger sisters, Mary and Rose Bartholomew, were staying with us while attending B. Y. U. Father had returned to Europe for further study. In late November, 1904, snow covered the ground and it was cold. Adelbert fell ill with diphtheria and was isolated. I soon succumbed to the same disease but was given the anti-toxin which helped turn the tide in my favor. When I began to recover I asked to see my brother Adelbert. He was my dearest playmate and, being about three-and-a-half years older, was also something of a champion and defender to me. They toid me that Adelbert had been taken away. No, he would not be back. He died 29 Nov. 1904 and was buried in the Provo cemetery. Grief and<span id="page-366"></span> the feeling of utter loss can come to a four year old. I felt bereft and sobered. I had loved this older brother with all the tanacity of my little soul. The feeling lasted for years. Father, of course, broke off his studies and returned from Europe immediately following the news of Adelbert’s passing. He came home to comfort his saddened family.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Electricity hadn’t come to Gunnison by June 1907, which was the time Elsie and Alma moved from Fayette into the beautiful new red brick house there that they had purchased from the sheepman, Lafe Bown. Most everyone used the common coal-oil or kerosene lamps for lighting and there seldom seemed enough to supply each room. There was a need then for the large center table upon which stood the parlor lamp, filled with coal-oil, its chimney freshly cleaned, sending out a glow of light round which family members flocked at nights, like moths to a flame. If lamps were scarce they were carried from room to room as needed, like the times when President Wilford Woodruff used to visit Bishop Bartholomew’s home in Fayette, when the children were small, as told by Mrs. Henry Bartholomew as she heard it from Roxie:— “President Wilford Woodruff was a favorite visitor at our home, especially with the children. Company always slept upstairs where, if the weather demanded, a nice fire would be built in a little iron stove. But there were never lamps enough to go around to allow the visitor to keep one in his or her room all night. When President Woodruff was there and had retired upstairs to his room with one of the few lamps, the children would wait and listen until they heard him start to snore, then they would say to the Bishop, ‘Father, now you can go up and get the lamp.’ Then father would be very cautious as he approached the stairs and when a big snore would come he would jump back, saying, ‘Do you think there is a bear upstairs?’ And how the children would laugh - ‘Do it again,’ they’d coax.” Incandescent lamps fed by gas were acquired by some homes and business places throughout Gunnison Valley however. Such lamps with glass chandeliers were in each of the seven rooms of the James Bown home in Gunnison when that family moved into<span id="page-367"></span> it in Sept. 1900. Quite likely Elsie’s and Alma’s new red brick home also had such ones when they moved in. Gas lamps, at five or six intersections along Gunnison Main Street, were lowered each evening and lit with a torch by the town marshal. He was usually accompanied by a group of children. Early each morning the gas lights were extinguished. The lamplighting era wasn’t really over in Gunnison until about 1912.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Who of us can remember the old black kitchen stoves with their long stovepipes, that had to be “blacked” and polished every so often with stove blacking or soot-black, and who can remember the stove brushes, stove lifters, stove lids, stove irons, stove shakers and stove pokers that went along with them? I dare say few of us have ever had to empty ashes from the ashboxes into the ashcans or onto the ash piles that cluttered up the back dooryard of every dwelling. Few of us have been required to remove the clinkers from the stove grates with the stove tongs or carry a stove shovel full of hot coals from a hot to a cold stove to start a fire when matches were scarce, much less to borrow coals from the neighbors. Does anyone now remember the black old stove rag chucked behind every kitchen stove, the coal skuttle and woodbox sitting beside that always seemed to need filling, and the hot water reservoir on the further side of the best kitchen stoves which always seemed to need refilling too? Who recalls the let-down oven doors which all clamored to “sit on first” to warm themselves on cold mornings when their teeth were chattering, and the cozy places behind by the chimneys that were always shared by the cats? Have all now forgotten when the bottoms of all cooking pots and kettles were soot-black and had to be scoured clean with every washing, and when dish rags and dish towels never quite came clean of black even with two sudsings and as many boilings? Likely there are few indeed who can remember the “smoking stoves” that sent all coughing to the open doors for fresh air and which blackened curtains and walls, or the “belching stoves” that threw soot and ashes all over everything. But some can. Yes, those were “the good old days!”<span id="page-368"></span> A family reunion was planned in honor of grandfather Laurs’ sixtieth birthday, which was July 22, 1907. All of his living descendants gathered at the old home in Gunnison for that occasion and those from out of town stayed over for July 24th as well. Most of the children, with their families, lived nearby: Chris and Caroline and their four girls and two boys were just a few blocks away; Joseph and Roxie with their two boys and one girl were a bit closer; Elsie and Alma with their four boys were settled in their new home, which was also within a few blocks of Laurs’ and Else’s; Emma and Charles came from their ranch a mile east of town with one child of each kind - but they were expecting another; Louis and Florence came from the ranch they lived on west of town with their one daughter and two sons; Arthur and Millie too lived close to the old home with their two little boys, the second hardly three months old, the youngest of the crowd. Albert and Jennie drove down from Manti with their two girls and two boys, the last boy not quite five months old. Andrew and Sarah with one daughter and two sons had the farthest to come since they lived in Salt Lake City and likely took the train down. Vena was of course at home, and being still single was expected, we suppose, to help with all the extra work brought on by a gathering of this kind. Tresia, though of course invited, was working in Salt Lake City and could not get away. What a happy gathering this must have been - forty-six wonderful people in one big family, with a good showing of males to carry on the Christensen name, each of the six Christensen sons having two living sons apiece.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chris was then overseer of all the herds of the Julius Christensen estate and had some herds of his own. There was good money then in sheep. Lou and Arthur were working with Chris, taking care of some of the herds. Andrew was Principal of the L. D. S. High School in Salt Lake City. Joseph was Principal of the Gunnison District School and Bishop of the Gunnison Ward as well. Albert was a successful practicing attorney in Manti and had his eye on a judgeship. The two older girls were successfully married, Elsie to a sheepman and Emma to a farmer and rancher.<span id="page-369"></span> The ever-loving Vena was always a great help in her parent’s home and also in the homes of her brothers and sisters whenever needed. Truly these were sons and daughters to be proud of.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Andrew’s and Sarah’s Edith (Edythe) has such happy rememberings of this and other holiday occasions, when their family returned to Gunnison when she was a child:— “I recall wonderful family reunions at the old Christensen homestead in Gunnison among our beloved grandparents, the erect, aristocratic-looking Laurs Mathias and the stately patrician-in-homespun Else Kathrine, and the families of relatives. Their welcome seemed so genuine - with no exceptions. Grandmother C’s welcome came straight from the heart. It was honest and all-enveloping! Anything she had was ‘yours for the asking’. The uncles would either proudly or shyly ask questions and tell us of many things. The aunts, less reticent, took us into their hearts and arms. They then proceeded to ‘kill the fatted calf’ or poultry; to bake unbelievably light breads, rolls and cakes; pick the choicest produce from their garden and bring out their special pride in pickles, jellies and jams. Ice was brought from the sawdust and a large freezer of ice cream was on the way. Need I give the amount of thick jersey cream and the number of fresh eggs that were poured into these makings? Oh, these were the times of feasting, visiting and comparing notes for the adults; and for the children, a never-to-be-forgotten opportunity with cousins, more cousins - and double cousins. If the events resulted in a family group picture by a professional, as it did during at least two of these reunions, we today are all most grateful to have such records of those choice gatherings.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A photographer had been arranged for to take a group picture of the entire family during this reunion, and all were lined up in due time on the sidewalk in front of the home. Chairs were placed for Laurs and Else and the married women. Rugs were spread in front for some of the children while others sat or leaned on their mothers. Pearl, Elora, Harold and Aunt Vena stood up in back with the men, some of whom were holding little ones.<span id="page-370"></span> I remember how long it seemed to take before everyone was arranged just so, and how hot the sun was. Some children kept squirming around as the photographer, under his black camera cover, tried to adjust his equipment. Other children ran here and there and had to be constantly brought back. The ground where I sat was so hard it was difficult to find a comfortable way of sitting. I put my legs out straight in front of me and mother Jennie said, “Sit with crossed legs dear, like your cousins.” I tried for a time but got tired - so put my knees up. Mother said, “Put your legs down dear, it isn’t nice to sit like that.” I put my legs down. “Why can’t Elaine and I change places?” I complained. “Why does she have to sit on a chair with the big people?” I might have known this was the only way they could keep her in tow. Sherman kept pulling off his starched cap and father kept putting it back on his head - Dad was so proud of that little Buster Brown suit mother had made from “Indian Head”. Mother had a brush and every time I squirmed she smoothed down my hair with it. I was so envious of Ruth Ellen’s ringlets, tied up with a bow, and Edith’s long ribbon-tied braids - not a hair out of place! Byron kept reaching over and pulling LaFaun’s long crimped hair until Aunt Emma slapped his hands. A. Owen kept whining for a drink until the other children took up the refrain and Aunt Vena went and brought a dipperful of water from the well and each took a sip, as far as it went - “Don’t dare drink too much” Aunt Elsie warned sharply! Several tries were made but every time the picture-taking-man went to snap, some child made a dash out of the lineup. Grandfather had to hold Melrose down between his knees to keep him from running. At last, when all seemed serene and ready and the big moment had come, the photographer held up his hand and prepared to shoot and we were about to be taken, when it was discovered that Elmer and Roy were missing - there they were up in the tree! How that photograph ever turned out so well I’ll never know, for only grandmother looked frazzled in it, although most of the others must have felt that way before the end. And guess what? I was caught with my knees up - Wouldn’t you know it?</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-371"></span> The folks had a dozen or more copies of the picture made, one for each family and some extras to send to their dear relations in Denmark for Christmas that year. That their Danish kinfolk received and appreciated the same is indicated in this translation of two letters received by the folks later, one from grandmother’s sister Stine and one from Stine’s husband, Svend Poulsen:—</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Monday Evening, 27 Jan. 1908 “Dear Sister Else:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I will tonight try to write a letter to you, our dear family, thanking you very much for the picture you sent us. It is really fun to see so many people on one piece of paper. Yes, all the little faces, how pretty they are - all of them. It is so much fun to see “Sotter Anders”, as the children say. Yes him we have seen in person you know and liked him at once - yes he won all of us! It would make us happy to see him among us again. Maybe some of his sisters and brothers will come sometime, but I guess you “Old Ones” won’t come. It is sad that you dear sister should be so far away from us. Now soon eighteen years have gone by since you visited us. I am much better now than when you were here. I thought just now that if it were now that you had come, I could really be happy. But thanks because you made the trip before, it was glorious to see you then and it was such a strenuous trip. It is good to know you have been strong and had good health, this is one of the great blessings in life. Next Oct. 12th I will turn sixty years old and I guess you are about two years older, if I remember right. It isn’t much I am getting written for my husband is sitting here on my right and is also busy writing to you. We have sometimes said if we could just get to know the date of your husband’s birthday then we would surprise him with a greeting. We hear from him so often and on the picture he looks very good. We wish it was clearer of you but it is not easy to get so many on such a little space. Again thanks for the picture and thanks because you write to the folks in Thorsted, then we also hear of you through them. But now when you get our new address, we hope you will write<span id="page-372"></span> to us sometime. Love to you all from your sister,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ane Kirstine Andersen (Stine Poulsen)”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Brother in Law and Family</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I also bring you thanks for the picture you sent us. Is it not strange that the number of people increase so much? When we look at the picture we realize that where there were about forty years ago only two people, now there are forty-six. Yes, yes, a half dozen strangers have come into the family but in spite of that it is still strange that the number has grown so large so fast. The best thing about it all is that they look like healthy people - all of them! I wonder if any of the many children and grandchildren will ever come to Little Denmark, the birthplace of the two “Old Ones”? It should be fun to see some of them over here. It is often now you know that people from the Far West visit Europe - even Denmark gets a few guests from there. Yes, I know we have had the pleasure of seeing one of the brood over here, namely Anders, which all of us in the family are so fond of. I don’t know if he will see this letter, if not tell him hello from us and give him thanks because he has been so friendly as to come and visit us for some days here in Denmark. It would make us happy if he would write us a letter and tell us about his stay in Europe after he left us, if he had any profit out of his trip and stay in the famous places. It would also be very pleasant to hear what he is doing, if he is a teacher for a group of young folks or if he writes books.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Yes, now our children are also grown up. The youngest, Viggo, will turn nineteen this 27th of April. But he is not well and is at present at the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, but we hope he will be cured - he also has good hopes for himself. There are so many here who have that sickness; at the place where Viggo is they have 170 patients. Our next youngest is Askel, he is twenty-two years old. He is attending High School this winter and is going in the military service in the fall. Next in line comes Holger who is twenty-four. He was home to celebrate Christmas vacation and then<span id="page-373"></span> went back to South Jutland. Kristine comes next, she is twenty-six years old. She is maid at the school. Then comes Dagmar who is thirty-one years old and works in Copenhagen. She was also home for Christmas vacation. Last comes Signe, and as you know she too is working at the High School. She is thirty-two. Then of course there are us two Old Ones, who are fine when we have our health but it is a little difficult with that once in a while. Though we as you know don’t earn money here as you can over there, we still get along well and hope that it will still be better now that everybody is going to have equal rights. A person will get the same right to speak, whether he be a day laborer or a rich farm owner and women will get the right to vote now too. I think they will have some influence, especially on the matters of schools and public welfare, for as you know the women have more warm heartedness in things like that. Yes the times have changed very much here at home since you left, and that in most everything concerned. I wonder how it will be in another forty years? But I guess it has changed even more where you live. I have read an account of the train which you traveled by when you went over there in 1866 - that must have been no joke! Friendly greetings to the whole family from us and our children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Svend Poulsen “Rosenly”, Vinding, Vejle, Denmark.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, as Svend Poulsen had said, things were changing, and this was true in Gunnison Valley. In about 1907 the cream separator had been introduced there. Before that all milk had been skimmed by hand, except for the time when in one household the milk pans had been skimmed off for several mornings and no one could tell how or by whom. But everyone was being blamed until someone chanced to go to the cellar at dusk one evening and there found a blow-snake of immense size daintily siphoning off the precious cream… In May 1900 the Bell Telephone Company had run a toll line through Sanpete and Sevier. The poles through Gunnison had been set down the middle of Main Street. The town had subscribed for one<span id="page-374"></span> telephone, which was installed in a shop-residence. When a call came in a messenger was sent to bring the person wanted to the telephone. In 1907 Leo Gledhill, Millie’s older brother, had improved on this by building a one circuit line in Gunnison, with signal ringing. Using a combination of short and long signals each subscriber did his own ringing and every ring came in loud and clear on every phone. But this system was also unsatisfactory and Mr. Gledhill was appointed to work out a bigger, better telephone service, and so in 1909 the Gunnison Telephone Company was organized, with a magneto switchboard being installed on the second floor of the postoffice and operated by Mary Gledhill. Forty telephones were installed that year with rates 50¢ per month for residents and $1.00 for businesses, one being installed in the home of Gunnison’s new Mayor, Joseph Christensen… Familiar sights in Gunnison before 1910 were the water barrel wagons making their rounds carrying that good tasting drinking water from Peacock Springs southeast of Sterling, to the many customers in Gunnison; for Gunnison drinking water in general tasted so terrible. When, in 1909, Centerfield and Mayfield were incorporated as towns and Gunnison became a third class city, the first big project of Gunnison City Council, under Mayor Joseph Christensen, was to purchase the Peacock Springs and have the water piped to Gunnison. Trenches were dug, pipes laid, and water made available to all the homes there by 1910… And there were seasons in those early years of the new century when the mice were so plentiful and playful that it took a truly brave man to stand up before the pulpit and address the congregation. Many a hero had the actual experience of having a mouse scamper up and down his trouser leg. In those days, so it has been said, the closing prayers in church meetings, unlike the long drawn-out ones of before, were short and streamlined and sometimes ended with “Amen, I caught ‘im”. Believe it or not, Uncle Joseph Christensen must have been among the brave then, since he presided as Gunnison’s Bishop most of the first decade of this century.</p>
