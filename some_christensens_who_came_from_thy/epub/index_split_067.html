  <p class="calibre1">(21) Myrtle Ivy Christensen (1) was born 10 Nov. 1904 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the house built for the family about 1895/96 in the southwest part of town and which is still standing (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Ivy was five and a half an epidemic of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-766" title="766"></span> the dreaded disease scarlet fever hit the small town and her family was among the victims; a red flag of quarantine hung on their gatepost. Her father was away on “The Weber” with the sheep at the time and before he could return her sister Orilla, not quite two years older than herself, died of the disease, 22 May 1910. Her father returned to comfort the distressed family and just in time to bid her thirteen year old sister, Elora, goodby, for she succumbed five days after Orilla. Joint funeral services were held for these two beautiful sisters on the lawn in front of their home and they were buried side by side in the Gunnison Cemetery. Ivy and the four other children were spared, including the eight months old baby Farrald, yet the home was never quite the same again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">July of that year 1910 Ivy’s family moved to a comfortable home with a spacious yard in Salt Lake City which her father had purchased from his brother Andrew and which was reported to have been built for early church President John Taylor. (Details of this home, written by Andrew’s daughter Edythe, are included in an earlier chapter.) Ivy has written a little about her life from here on and from this we quote:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember Grandfather and Grandmother Christensen very well. They used to come and stay at our house almost every year after we moved to Salt Lake, to attend General Conference. One thing I especially recall is that after they had gone to bed each night, since Pearl’s and my bedroom adjoined theirs, they would talk to us what seemed like hours about politics.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I started school at the Roosevelt School, 9 East and 33 South, and went to eighth grade in the Hawthorn School on 17 South 7 East. I attended High School at Granite High, 33 South 5 East. I was active in sports of all kinds, especially outdoor sports. I enjoyed dramatics in High School, which took us out of town and to different schools and churches to put on small plays.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I took piano lessons for two years from Marion Cannon. I was organist in the Primary and Sunday School in Wandemere Ward. I played for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-767" title="767"></span> MIA dances for about a year. I have also done a lot of lovely handwork over the years. In summers we lived at the ranch in Wyoming or over in the summer home in Weber Canyon, which ranch we called ‘The Weber’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These lovely summers on the ranches in Wyoming and Utah came to an end for Ivy and others of their family, with the exception of Pearl, when their father met with his death on the ranch in Wyoming, 5 Oct. 1917, from an accident a few days earlier. When word of their father’s accident reached Salt Lake City, Ivy’s mother left Ivy, then lacking a month of being thirteen, in charge of her two younger brothers, eight and five-and-a-half, while she rushed to the side of her dying husband. A kind neighbor kept an eye on them the several days their mother was gone. This was indeed a time of heartbreak for the bereft family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ivy continues: “I was married when nineteen years of age, 29 Oct. 1923, in Salt Lake City to Melvin Glen Campbell (born 3 Oct. 1904 in Salt Lake City to Robertson Sim and Agnes Hind Napier Campbell). I have worked most of my married life so have had little time for other things outside of that and raising a nice family, two girls and one boy. A third girl and our last child died the day of birth, unnamed. I worked for Auerbach’s and the Paris Department Stores for two years and then, during World War II, I worked at the Remington Arms Plant for a year. Since then I have worked at Snelgrove’s Ice Cream Store for some twenty-three years and am still employed there at the present time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My husband has been employed by the City here in Salt Lake most of our married life except for one year (abt. 1932) when we lived in Los Angeles, California; up until the time he suffered his heart attack and stroke 9 Nov. 1966. The road to recovery has been a slow old road to follow. He has made more than one-trip to the hospital since then. He isn’t working but has really been blessed since he got out of the hospital the last time. He gets really tired of doing nothing. With spring coming, however, I’m sure he can keep busy and will feel even better. It isn’t good to be idle and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-768" title="768"></span> that is why I am going to go on working as long as I can.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We went through the temple in Salt Lake 11 Sep. 1968 and were married for eternity, after having taken the Project Temple course. We are so happy about this. We only wish that our children were sealed to us, but perhaps someday they too will see the importance of it and prepare themselves for this great blessing. At least we have now made a start in the right direction and set the example for them.”</p>
