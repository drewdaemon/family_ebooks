  <p class="calibre1">Elvena [Elvine in Else K.‘s entry on her birth], eleventh and last child and ninth producing branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen family, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 27 Mar. 1887. She was born in the “new rock house” in northwest Gunnison. According to information recorded in her mother’s journal she was born about 9 o’clock at night on a Sunday. Her mother also recorded that she was blessed and named at home the 7th of April by Norien. (This last is hard to read and perhaps misspelled.) She also recorded that the child was taken to church for her official blessing and naming, 23 Dec. 1889, which was done by Bishop A. C. Madsen. The name given her, Elvena, was according to an old Danish custom of naming children - viz: If the eighth child was a boy he was named Otto, if the eleventh child was a girl she was named Elevena, etc. Elevena was shortened to Elvena in this case but she was later called “Vena” more often than not.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elvena’s mother was a trained doctress and midwife and her time was much in demand in Gunnison Valley. Thus the child was often left in the care of other members of the family. When she was one year and two months old, her mother brought home another little baby girl to raise, Ada Lorena Madsen, two months and twelve days old. Elvena’s mother had delivered the little girl and taken care of her and her mother during the long period of the mother’s illness. Knowing that she would die, the young mother had begged the older woman to take her baby and raise her as her own. So when Ada’s mother passed away, Elvena’s mother brought little Ada to the Christensen home to live. The two babies, blond, healthy Elvena and dark haired, sickly little Ada took to each other right away and became almost inseparable as the days and years went by.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was great excitement in Sanpete Valley <span id="page-650"></span> and in fact in the whole of Utah that spring of 1888, for the beautiful Manti Temple had just been completed. A three day dedicatorial celebration was held in the Temple and some in attendance spoke of hearing “a heavenly chorus singing” and of other manifestations of divine approval. The main dedication service took place 21 May 1888 and the dedicatory prayer was offered by President Lorenzo Snow. This was the third holy temple to be dedicated in Zion and the Saints gathered from all over for the occasion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Elvena was three and a half, Sept. 1890, her mother left for a three months trip to her native land of Denmark to visit her relatives who still resided there. She took little two-and-a-half year old Ada with her, not daring to leave the frail child in the care of others for that length of time. If three-and-a-half year old Elvena’s nose was a bit “out of joint” because she was left home we could not entirely blame her. Yet being of so sweet and loving a disposition she probably “took it in her stride” after the first wave of disappointment had ebbed. Her oldest sister Elsie stayed out of school those three months to look after things and her father also helped as well as her thirteen-year-old sister Emma, whom Elvena adored. But she must have been a happy child when her mother and Ada returned home, about Christmastime that year, bringing greetings and gifts from cousins in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ada passed away the winter of 1897, not long before Vena turned ten. This must have been a sad experience for Vena since she and Ada had been so very fond of each other. Being forced to part from a loved one can make quite an impression on one of this age, especially of Vena’s sensitive nature—when the bonds of love have been so closely knit. Vena missed the little invalid Ada terribly. That feeling of loss must have been somewhat assuaged, however, when another little girl who needed a home was taken in by the Christensens soon after school started the next fall. Vena’s new companion in the home was Tresia, a little Swedish girl about two years younger than herself - but wiser in the ways of the world. She was treated like one of the family <span id="page-651"></span> for, as Tresia herself said, “If Vena got a new dress I got a new dress and if Vena got new shoes I got new shoes.” Tresia remembers that both she and Vena wore new shoes the night they drove up to Manti in the two-seated buggy with “Papa and Mama” as she called Vena’s parents, to attend the wedding reception of “brother Albert” and his wife Jennie, 26 Sept. 1900. Vena was thirteen-and-a-half and Tresia past eleven-and-a-half at the time. Though quite different in temperament and experience, these two girls learned to love each other dearly and established a deep friendship that existed as long as they both lived.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena’s two brothers just older, Arthur and Louis, were great teases and played many pranks on her; like the time they put her down the well where she was supposed to hide for a game and then went off and forgot to bring her back up; and the time they induced her to lay down in the ditch where the bridge was supposed to be, to rise up and frighten their mother when she came at dusk with the buckets of swill to feed the pigs, but she got stepped on and doused with the filthy swill instead; or the time when the boys had been punished and sent to bed upstairs without their suppers and they dressed her up like a “poor” child, well disguised in a shawl, and sent her to beg some food from their mother for her “starving brothers and sisters”, but got a good spanking instead. The guileless Vena was the victim of their pranks so often that it was surprising she didn’t catch on to them - and perhaps she did after a time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena attended the public school in Gunnison. One of her school chums was Rose Bartholomew (Peterson), recently deceased. Rose said that she and Vena were almost inseparable in their youth. They graduated from the eighth grade together and since there was no high school in Gunnison at the time this was all the formal schooling that they had. Vena’s brother Joseph was their teacher in eighth grade and also the Principal.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena grew to be a very pretty young woman, tall and slender with a fair skin, large blue eyes and the most beautiful, almost golden colored hair. <span id="page-652"></span> I remember at one time my mother Jennie bought a beautiful piece of gold colored satin for a dress for Vena because it would “go so well with her lovely hair”. On one occasion Vena was chosen as the “Goddess of Liberty” for a Fourth of July celebration in Gunnison, for which that town was famous, and she rode on the main float in the parade, decked out in a long white flowing robe girded with a long braided satin cord, and with a golden colored crown on her upswept, beautifully arranged golden colored hair. She also sat in state in the patriotic assembly which followed. Truly she must have been a picture of loveliness!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the winter of 1909 her parents sold the rock house in which she had been born and grown to womanhood and moved to Manti to be near the temple, for they were so interested in doing their genealogy. Vena, still unwed at twenty-two and the only child at home, moved along with them. She often used to tell that no matter how old or tall she had become, her mother Else always introduced her to new people as her “baby”. The embarrassed girl used to counter by saying, “brother Arthur is the baby boy”, but could never hide her blushes. She was so timid and modest around strangers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena seldom stayed at home in Manti however, for she was so much in demand by her sisters and brothers to assist in their homes and with their families. She was always so capable and willing that it is easy to see how she may have been imposed upon at times by those she loved. We doubt if she seldom or ever refused or complained. Whenever there was any need in any of the Christensen families, the call went out for “Vena”! She was truly an angel of mercy to each and everyone of them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In midsummer of 1910 Vena’s parents left for a three months trip to Denmark to visit their relatives and search out more of their genealogy. Her father still had his only living brother residing there whom he had not seen in forty-four years, or since before he left the Old Country the spring of 1866. Her mother of course had been back twenty years before and established a close relationship once again with her three Danish sisters and one brother and their families living there. They had corresponded <span id="page-653"></span> often during those twenty years. When they learned that “Aunt Else” was returning to Denmark some of Vena’s Danish girl cousins about her age wrote begging that “Cousin Elvena” be allowed to come along. What could have been more wonderful than for Vena to have made this trip to Denmark with her parents, especially since her brother Andrew and his family would be joining them from Germany where Andrew was studying? Why she didn’t go we do not know. Perhaps she was too timid, not knowing the Danish language, but more likely it was because of the great expense of such a trip.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That autumn, while her parents were still away, Vena’s brother Albert’s family was stricken with scarlet fever. The daughter Elaine came down with it just as they were preparing to move into a lovely new home in Manti. They had sold their old home so Elaine was taken by her mother to her grandfather Snow’s home where they were both quarantined in for some weeks. Vena’s help was sought and she accepted the responsibility of being quarantined in with the other three children, Virginia, Sherman and Hale, nine, five-and-a-half and three-and-a-half respectively. Albert rented a large furnished room in a dilapidated rock house belonging to old Mr. Henry that stood just across the fence south of the new house and into this moved Vena and the three children. Albert was of course quarantined out of both places, because of his work, but took care of the extra needs of all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How well I recall being penned up in that long, dark room with our beds at one end, a cooking stove, cupboards and makeshift sink at the other, and a large round table in between where we ate our meals and carried on many of our other activities. This table was centered by a large fancy kerosene lamp and here Aunt Vena played solitaire with cards in the evenings after the little boys had gone to bed, while I worked at pencil games or read a book. How Aunt Vena loved to play solitaire! But her sunny disposition and cheerful ways brightened our lives and kept us mostly contented in our locked-in condition. The brightest time of all each day, however, was when Daddy came with our groceries and special treats <span id="page-654"></span> for all. Happily none of us took the disease so we were able to move out of there and into our new home as soon as the quarantine was lifted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena had worked at the woolen mills in Provo for a short time several years before, when Andrew and Sarah lived there, and stayed at their place; but she had never really been “away to work”. Tresia had left the Christensen home to go to work in Salt Lake City when she was sixteen and never returned except for visits. The tales of her escapades must have given Vena a longing to see something of the big city, make her own money and spend it on luxuries and be independent as it were. Tresia always had such beautiful bonnets, shoes, dresses and rustling silk petticoats when she came back to visit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must have been soon after her parents had returned from Europe that Vena gained their consent to go to Salt Lake City to find employment. She could live with Caroline, the wife of her brother Chris, since Caroline was in need of adult company at nights, Chris being away much of the time on Bennion Livestock Company business, for he was the manager. Vena got a job at the Hotel Utah working in the linen room and here she was employed for several years. Doubtless she had been duly cautioned beforehand by her mother and others to “beware of strangers - especially males”, for Tresia says that during all the time she worked at the hotel she never spoke to the male guests if she could help it nor ever once touched the boxes of candy and money they left for her as tips. She possessed a moral integrity that could not be questioned. Some may have called her “old fashioned” but she should have been envied by the less scrupulous.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She eventually gave up her work at the Hotel Utah and went where she was most needed among members of her family - to be with Elsie and her children on the ranch in Wyoming - to help Emma bottle fruit or cook for threshers - to be with Albert’s motherless children when his wife Jennie passed away in 1916. Fortunate is the family who has an “Aunt Vena” to love and care for them in times of need! Her numerous nieces and nephews <span id="page-655"></span> all learned to adore her without exception and with good cause.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Vena longed for children of her own. Her brother Chris “I” was largely responsible in getting her interested in a fine fellow about her age named George T. Clark - and in getting George interested in Vena. George had worked for Chris for a number of years as one of the herders of the Bennion Livestock Company and he had found him to be honest, hard working, clean living and most dependable, besides having a very kind disposition and being a bachelor. Chris felt that George would make an excellent husband for Vena, who was pressing thirty, and he had a great desire to see his youngest sister happily married.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was a native of Upton, Utah, and as a company herder must have often gone to the Company ranch in Upton for supplies when Vena’s brother was operating that ranch. Whether Vena ever met George while visiting Arthur and Millie at Upton we cannot be certain. Arthur and family left Upton the autumn of 1915 and moved back to Gunnison, and Vena seemed to have no visions of a prospective marriage at the time she was taking care of her brother Albert’s motherless children in 1916/17, or she would have told them. She was still at Albert’s the middle of June 1917, as attested to by the following excerpt from Elaine’s journal dated 16 June 1917: - “We’ve worked hard carrying benches, tables, Victrola and lights out to the lawn for our lawn party. Dear Aunt Vena has worked so hard cooking and sewing for us…”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must have been very soon after that, however, that Vena left Manti and went to the ranch in Wyoming to visit her sister Elsie and children and others of her relatives living there. Chris had helped her file on some homestead land close to the others on The Oasis and she was supposed to live on it a certain part of each year and make improvements on it as Louis, Elsie and others were doing. Her brother Chris, the sly one, must have taken this opportunity to get Vena and George Clark together somehow and the spark was lighted. Their romance grew rapidly, fostered by Chris and the others, and it was not many weeks before <span id="page-656"></span> Vena and George had decided to get married.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They went to the Uinta county seat at Evanston, Wyoming for their license and were married there by the L. D. S. Bishop, 14 Aug. 1917. Both were thirty at the time. Much of the credit for this marriage could be given to the cupid with reddish whiskers, Chris “I”. His daughter Pearl says that the couple went to Salt Lake City right after their marriage and spent the first night of their honeymoon at her mother Caroline’s home. She remembers her mother telling about the large straw hat Vena was wearing, trimmed with a large bunch of gay colored artificial flowers. Somehow during the night the cat got hold of that hat and tore it all to pieces, and that was the end of Vena’s wedding bonnet.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Salt Lake they went on to Manti where Vena showed George off to her Sanpete County relatives. Then it was back to The Oasis in Wyoming, where they lived with Elsie while George built a house on Vena’s property, a two-roomed log house with an attic. Chris gave George work on or near the ranch so that he could be near his new bride. George helped with the harvesting of the crops on Chris’ place that fall and he was there when the crops were burned and, shortly afterwards, when the wonderful Chris “I” was shot and died. He helped a great deal at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena must have gone home to live with her parents that winter in Manti while George went out again with the sheep. Returning to Wyoming in early spring she was able to live in her own log house, which was not too far from her sister Elsie’s or her brother Louis’ log and frame houses. George was able to be home off and on but by July Vena had returned to Manti to be near the help of her mother for the birth of her first child.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vera was born in Manti at the home of her Christensen grandparents, 12 July 1918, and was delivered by her grandmother Else. Tresia says Vena had a very hard time of it. She took baby Vera back up on the Oasis in Wyoming to live as soon as she was able, for she wanted to “prove up” on her land. It wasn’t too long after the end of that</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-657"></span> year that the Bennion Livestock Company was sold and all of the Christensens, except Louis and his family, had sold or given up their land there and left the area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That winter (1918/19) Vena went again to live with her parents in Manti and it was perhaps the next spring that George joined her there. They were encouraged to stay on in Utah and Vena’s brother Albert gave George work on his Gunnison ranch, a mile or so west of Gunnison. There was plenty for George to do looking after the feeding of the sheep and cattle on the ranch. He and Vena and small Vera lived at Vena’s sister Emma’s that winter and it was at the Peterson home that their second child, Alta, was born (Feb. 1921). In the spring of 1921 George and Vena and their two little girls moved into the small farm house on the Gunnison ranch and it was here that their third daughter, Tresia, was born in May 1922. Emma took care of one year old Alta for them at that time. There was always so much love between Emma and Vena that they could scarcely help each other enough.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In her own history their oldest daughter, Vera Clark (Lyons) recalls some of the things she has been told about life on that Gunnison ranch: — “Ivan Lyons’ folks were also farming west of Gunnison, for the Mellors, and my folks and his visited back and forth and played cards together. They would do the chores at night, get out the horse and wagon, then, taking us children with them, go and spend the night at Lyons’ visiting and playing cards while we slept, then go back home next morning in time to do the chores again. Lyons’ boy Ivan, two-and-a-half years older than I,tried to lift me over a ditch once and dropped me into the water. He remembers this well because his Dad gave him a licking for it. I was not much more than four at the time. (Ivan Lyons later became Vera’s husband).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The summer of 1922 Albert gave George work on the Star Ranch north of Nephi and that fall George moved his family to Goshen, not far north of there, and went to work in the mines at Dividend, Utah, where his brother-in-law, Alma Bartholomew, had employment. Alma and Elsie <span id="page-658"></span> also lived in Goshen. Vera writes: “The folks rented a place in Goshen across from the George Burraston family who were always fine neighbors and have always been good friends ever since. Dad finally bought a little home across the road from mother’s sister and her husband, Aunt Elsie and Uncle Alma Bartholomew.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in Goshen that Vena gave birth to her fourth daughter, LaFay, Sept. 1923, and it was there in Nov. 1924 that their first son, George Fern Clark, was born. Two years later, in Nov. of 1926, another daughter, Lorraine, was born to Vena and George. This was a difficult winter for them because the children had so much sickness. Vera writes of this: - “The year I was in the third grade was a tough one for us. We had measles, mumps, chicken pox, and also scarlet fever. I had scarlet fever and LaFay had measles at the same time. Mother said the doctor came every day to see both of us but he thought I was going to die and that LaFay would get well, but it turned out just the opposite, for LaFay took pneumonia and passed away 24 Feb. 1927. I remember the morning she died. Alta and I were awake and mother wrapped us in quilts and took us into the room where she lay. We were under quarantine and the only one who could leave the place was Dad. He went to work, did our shopping and all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“LaFay’s funeral services were held on our lawn and they placed her casket just inside the front door. It was the last of February and very cold and mother sat weeping with us children all around her wrapped up in quilts and three-and-a-half month old Lorraine on her lap. None of us were able to go to the cemetery because of the quarantine, except Dad who took her to the Goshen Cemetery and buried her, with the help of relatives and neighbors who had gathered for the occasion.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One more child, a second boy named LaMar, was born to Vena and George in Goshen. There were happy times along with the sad times there. Vera writes: - “I can remember mother and dad going to dances now and again in Goshen, They took me to a Valentine’s dance once where the women brought box lunches and the men drew for <span id="page-659"></span> them. Mother and Dad both loved to dance and Dad was an especially good dancer. When I grew older the dance I had with him at every dance we both attended was the thrill of the evening.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vera continues: - “We moved to Santaquin on April 1st 1930, just before I finished sixth grade, but I was still promoted. Dad had bought a lot there with no house on it, so we rented a house on the same block until he could build on it. He moved the big garage from our place in Goshen onto our lot in Santaquin. It made two rooms into which we moved. Later he added other rooms.” Tresia writes: - “In my second year of school we moved to Santaquin. I remember spending hours and hours moving rocks from the ground before Dad could plant a garden. We rented until enough of our own house was finished for us to move in. Then we only had lanterns to see by at nights for some weeks and I remember how wonderful it seemed when we got electricity into the house.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mary Gledhill Dowdle said that the Christensen and Gledhill girls were always close friends through the years, as were the Christensens and Bartholomews. Mary lived in Payson while Vena lived in Santaquin and she says while living in Santaquin that Vena used to entertain her neighbors and friends at a program and musical regularly every month in her home. Although none of their children had any musical talent to speak of, George bought her a piano more or less for these occasions. Vena loved music, as did her sisters Elsie and Emma, and though she never had any special training she taught herself to play the piano some. Mary said that Vena loved people and that her sweet ways and thoughtfulness of others endeared her to all who knew her. Mary also said that Vena attended Relief Society and other church meetings faithfully and that she had one of the fondest dreams of her life realized when George took her to the “House of the Lord” and they and their six younger children were sealed for time and eternity. (Another daughter, Viola, had been born in Payson in June 1931, about a year after they moved to Santaquin.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena was the only one of the Christensen <span id="page-660"></span> brothers and sisters who hadn’t yet had her temple work done and this had worried her more as time went on and the children grew older. It took a near tragedy in George’s and Vena’s lives, however, to get them to the temple. Tresia tells of this: - “The spring my oldest sister Vera was married (Apr. 1938) on Easter Sunday. I was with a group of young friends in a car when we had a terrible accident. I was badly injured and not expected to live for a time, my face being cut almost from ear to ear and other damage. I was unconscious for quite a period and the first time I saw my father, after regaining consciousness, I told him that I was concerned that he and mother had not been to the temple to be sealed for eternity. This seemed to be constantly on my mind after the accident and I remembered mother worrying about my sisters Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she and Dad had us children sealed to them. I exacted a promise from Dad at that time that they would prepare to go to the temple before my eighteenth birthday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My parents did prepare themselves and were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in Manti and have their temple work done and us younger children sealed to them for eternity, the very day before my eighteenth birthday - 27 May 1940. I know how happy they will be when all of their children are sealed to them and we can be together as a family in the world where they have gone. They made many sacrifices for us and the least we can do now for them is to prepare ourselves by righteous living to join them in the eternity.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vera writes: - “Mother and Dad went through the Manti Temple the day before Tresia’s eighteenth birthday and had the six younger children sealed to them. Alta and I were too old at the time. Cousins Byron and Mildred went through the temple with them and then they all came over to Ephraim where Ivan, I and our first son were living at the time and I had dinner ready for them. Byron brought ice cream for everyone for the occasion. Mildred said she bet I’d never dreamed that I’d be cooking my parents’ wedding dinner someday!” <span id="page-661"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">When World War II came along, their oldest son George went into the service. He became a gunner on a bomb squad flying missions over Germany. On his tenth bombing mission his plane was shot down over Germany and all the crew killed except George, who was wounded and taken prisoner. For seven months he was listed as “missing in action” and his family had no idea whether he was dead or alive. This must have been a real ordeal for Vena and George and their family. But George Jr., by the grace of a higher power, returned home safe and well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena’s husband George passed away 12 Apr. 1951. They had been married going on thirty-four years, nearly thirty years of which he had worked in the mines. He had retired from the mines and was trying his hand at herding sheep again when he became ill and was brought home. Vera writes: - “The day Dad died he had the Elders in to administer to him. They promised him a good night’s rest. Later he sent mother out of the room to get him something and when she returned he was dead.” George was buried beside little LaFay in the Goshen cemetery. Vena received some compensation, following his death, from the Industrial Commission because he died of “miners consumption”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Besides helping to raise her brothers’ and sisters’ children and her own seven, Vena raised a grandson, Terry, as long as she was able, since his mother, Alta, had to work for a living away from home. Left a widow, Vena continued to spend much of her time in Santaquin but visited around and stayed with her married children occasionally, especially Tresia. She had enjoyed comparatively good health throughout her life, although at one time in her earlier years a doctor said she had a breast cancer. Her family fasted and prayed for her and the suspicious looking lump disappeared. In middle age Vena became very heavy. It was probably this extreme overweight that caused the troubles and discouragement and the painful arthritis in her head, neck and shoulders that she suffered about the last year of her life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When it came to the point that she needed a lot of special care, it was impossible for her <span id="page-662"></span> children to do what was needed - though they did all they could. She was placed in a rest home in Payson for a short while but was unhappy there because none of her children were near. So she was moved to a rest home in Salt Lake City and was only there a very short time when she passed away, 5 July 1956, at sixty-nine years three months and eight days. She had outlived her husband George a little over four years and two months.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vena Christensen Clark’s body rested in state in a lovely casket in her home in Santaquin, surrounded by flowers. Hundreds of relatives and friends came to view her and later to honor her at a beautiful memorial service in the Ward chapel there. She was laid to rest in the Goshen cemetery 8 July 1956 beside her dear husband and her small daughter LaFay.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So after death they came to see “Aunt Vena”, relatives, nieces and nephews, as they had sought her out in love in couples, groups or individually as long as she lived and wherever she lived. She had long been a favorite with them all. One of her nieces, Elaine Christensen (Southwick) wrote a tribute to her which will perhaps find an echo in the hearts of all who knew and loved her, She titles it, of course, “Aunt Vena”:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Perhaps my remembered image of Aunt Vena is like Stendhal’s idea of “crystalization”. He claims that we do not see a person we really love as she actually is but endow her with qualities that she does not actually possess. ‘In the salt mines’ he says, ‘it is possible to leave a dead branch - a black and ugly piece of wood - and to find next morning when one returns that it has become covered with salt crystals and is now a glittering object which is a delight to behold.’ So maybe in my mind I have adorned Aunt Vena with a whole ‘array of glittering crystals’ which she may not have possessed - but this I doubt. Rather, I may not have given her due credit for all she was to me when she came to live with us after mother’s death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember very little of her before that time and might have forgotten more had I not been <span id="page-663"></span> writing a journal while she was at our home. One of the most outstanding things about Aunt Vena was her chameleon ability to be any given age at any required time. Although in years she numbered almost thirty against my fourteen, we shared secrets, activities and like heart pangs. Besides providing me and my friends with homemade bread, thick cream and sugar for an after school snack, she also provided a sounding board and a sympathetic understanding of my restless teenage fancies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As I look back through the eyes of experience, I can now know how tired she must have been from all of our varied demands, how lonely for love and attention from friends her own age, and yet how patient, understanding and available she was for our diversified family needs. I know that she showed a great compassion for all of us and that she was especially close to little Phillip as she must have also been to mother. That mother had adored her for her sweetness, gentleness and selflessness I have no doubt. She had admired the glint of Aunt Vena’s spun gold hair; and in hopes that Virginia and I might possess a like adornment, she had us brush our locks one hundred strokes a day in the sunshine. Mother had believed in the philosophy of the Great Stone Face and had us try to emulate the benign and guileless expression Aunt Vena had.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Aunt Vena, bowing before the perplexity of problems attendant to caring for five motherless children, often dreamed of mother, for she told us so. She saw her in teaching situations of all kinds, and yet she seemed always to nod encouragement and approval at Aunt Vena who stood humbly on this side of the veil, seeking help. She did so want to please ‘Jennie’. Aunt Vena slept in the Blue Room with four-year-old Phillip, who clung to her as a substitute for his mother. One morning just at dawn she awoke to see little Phil smiling and nodding at someone who seemed to be leaving the room. Upon asking Phil who the visitor was he replied, ‘I’ve been talking to my mama.’ That Aunt Vena herself at times lived close to the angels, I have never doubted. <span id="page-664"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“She was loved by all members of her family, young and old alike, but because of her lack of subterfuge and her child-like qualities she was often a butt for family pranks when she was a girl. She used to entertain us children with stories of the escapades she experienced with her brothers just older, and other unusual happenings in her girlhood. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when she told about the time she had saved up extra eggs enough to buy a coveted blouse. She told of carrying the eggs in a basket and, accompanied by grandmother, going carefully up the weed bordered sidewalk toward town. As they came to a wooden bridge, spanning an irrigation ditch, they stepped simultaneously upon a loose board. Aunt Vena, who weighed less than grandmother, flew into the air and landed on, in and under the ill-fated eggs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In appearance during her married years I remember her as large, comfortable and expressive. Her eyes were light blue and readily showed every expression she felt. Smile crinkles bordered her eyes and smile wrinkles deepened the corners of her mouth that sometimes pouted in mock severity. She had a slight impediment in her speech (lisping, I think) but it didn’t stop the volubility of expressed love and concern for all of her children and grandchildren and those of her ‘dear brothers and sisters’. Her appelation for her family was always prefixed by ‘dear’. It was ‘dear brother Albert or dear brother Joseph, or Andrew, or Chris, or Louis, or Arthur’. And it was ‘dear sister Ada, or Emma, or Elsie, or Tresia.’ Her heart was as big as her family and was the pivot around which the family news circulated. She was an excellent letter writer. She treasured the letters, cards, pictures and clippings anyone sent her and she was eager to pass on any family news she received.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Although I saw very little of Aunt Vena during her last years, I do know that her children honored and loved her and that everyone who knew her spoke of her with endearing admiration. To me she will always be a dear and cherished entity crystalized into a glittering object endowed with empathy, charity, trust, and a child-like faith in life, humanity and God, which made her a delight <span id="page-665"></span> to know and a paragon to remember.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George Thomas Clark, husband of Elvena Christensen, was born 6 June 1887 in Upton, Summit, Utah. His parents were early Mormon pioneers of Upton, from England, William Rolland and Amelia Frances Smith Clark. He spent his early boyhood in Upton and attended the public schools that were available there. But it was necessary for him to work hard, for Upton was a frontier town and the people were mostly poor and had to struggle for a living.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Upton, first called “Up From Town” because of the altitude and distance from Coalville, which was settled first, is still fourteen miles from Coalville. The elevation is still the same, about 7,000 ft.; the winters are still long; only the name has been shortened. Starvation, cold and disease stared grimly at the first settlers there 105 years ago. Deep snows softened the stark brush and rock covered slopes but made foraging difficult for farm and wild game animals. Clearing acreage for planting had been difficult and the pioneers had realized only a little barley, oats and a few potatoes from a summer of hard labor. A few rabbits and an occasional elk supplemented their meager diet, and one family was forced to empty the straw from their beds to keep the family cow alive through the long dreary months.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coalville was first settled in 1859 by a few settlers who were attracted by the good farmland at the confluence of Chalk Creek and the Weber River. That same year coal was discovered along Chalk Creek and more families flocked to this high country. Isaac Burton and John Stanley followed Chalk Creek still higher into the mountains and cleared some land and built a pole fence around it. In 1861 Joseph Huff came, saw the land and exchanged a cow for it. That summer he harvested a crop of wild hay and built a cabin. In early 1863 others began trickling in and soon more than 40 families called Upton home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Slowly they cleared the land and brought <span id="page-666"></span> irrigation streams from nearby creeks. Oxen and mules were used for plowing. In addition to farming, some worked small coal mines, some hauled logs to Park City, Salt Lake City and Evanston, Wyoming. Much of this land is still in the families of those Upton pioneers - Boyers, Clarks, Saxtons, Meadows, Stayleys, Powells. Most of them were converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and some, including the Clarks, were from England. They recorded baptisms in Chalk Creek through holes chopped in the ice in winter months. They built a church, a school and a fine amusement hall.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These Upton pioneers not only built their own houses but they built their own furniture as well. They whitewashed the walls of their log cabins with lime and added board floors that were scrupulously cleaned with homemade lye soap. They made their own shoes and much of their clothing. They raised gardens, raspberries and rhubarb. They trapped beaver from nearby streams and lakes and they even took time out to fight Indians, if that happened to be necessary. They held community dances and other celebrations and had their fun on homemade sleds in winters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were lots of Clarks in Upton and all of them were related to George. His grandmother Clark came from England to Upton. His grandfather and grandmother Clark came and settled in Upton. His father and mother were married in Upton. Some of them had come there as early as 1869. His grandfather’s brother, Frank Clark who was an artist, painted murals on all four walls of the large Upton recreation hall which people from all around came there to see. Yes, George had lots of relatives who had settled in Upton; for besides his grandparents there were aunts and uncles, great aunts and great uncles and cousins by the dozens.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George’s father and mother lived in Upton for some years and then moved into Wyoming for another few years but returned again to live in Upton. It was here that the majority of their ten children were born. Tragedy struck the family in 1904 however, when George was nearing seventeen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-667"></span> His mother gave birth to her tenth child on March 12th of that year but the little one died on the 14th and the mother died on the 18th of the effects of that childbirth. The next youngest child, age two, passed away the end of that month, and as if this weren’t enough for the family to bear, the father was rushed to Coalville with bloodpoisoning the forepart of April and died there. There were less than three weeks between the deaths of George’s parents, four of the family dying in less than a month.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was next to the oldest of the seven remaining children, a third child of ten having died in 1900. His daughter Vera writes: - “There were seven children left in the family and they were soon scattered among the various relatives or anyone that would take them. Dad had no school after that and was shifted around among two or three different uncles at one time or another, as they were able to use him in farming or with the sheep. He eventually ended up herding sheep for the Bennion Livestock Company and it was through the manager of that company, Chris “I” Christensen, that he met his future wife, Elvena.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was two months and ten days younger than Elvena. Vera tells that during April and May of each year her father used to tease her mother about being the “oldest” in the family, saying he was sure glad that he wasn’t as old as she or that he’d surely hate to be the oldest, or some such. But nearly thirty-four happily married years came out of that marriage and eight lovely children, seven of whom grew to maturity, married and had children of their own. They have a good sized posterity today.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was rather small of stature, slightly shorter than Elvena. But he was tall in the things that mattered most - honesty, industry, charity, goodwill - there is not room here to name all of his good qualities. He was a kind and loving husband and a good father. He was not able to provide his family with many luxuries but their home was one of peace, understanding and love. He had many talents even though he had had little training and few opportunities. He loved music <span id="page-668"></span> and used to play for dances in Upton and that area before he was married. They say he played the banjo well, was excellent on the harmonica, could chord on the organ and piano, and could sure play the mandolin like a professional. Though he had never had a music lesson in his life he could play any piece of music that the dance band played.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George worked in the mines in Juab County for almost thirty years. In fact, he worked there until the mines closed down about 1950. At a large celebration held in Payson, honoring men of long and outstanding service to mining at that time, George was presented with a pin for his fine contribution. But he worked in the mines too long as far as his health was concerned. Breathing the poor air and dust in the mines so long brought on silicosis which caused his death, 12 Apr. 1951, at age sixty-four years ten months and six days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was buried 16 Apr. 1951 in the Goshen cemetery. Two weeks later, upon the advice of and after serious consultation with his doctor, a lawyer, and his mother who was hard to convince, his son George arranged to have his father’s body exhumed and an autopsy performed to prove the nature of the condition that caused his death. From the report of those who examined him it was possible to file a claim with the Industrial Commission which eventually paid his mother a lump sum plus small monthly payments thereafter, which helped her so much at that time. But an unusual thing happened during the time the body was being examined. Some of George senior’s own relatives, who had been unable to attend his funeral, came to the Goshen cemetery to visit his grave and found nothing but a gaping hole beside his marker. They immediately called on Vena and made things very difficult for her at the time.</p>
