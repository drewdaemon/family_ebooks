  <p class="calibre1">Louis, or “Lou”, eighth child, fifth son and seventh producing branch of the Laurs and Else K. Christensen family, was born 20 Mar. 1880 in Mayfield,  Sanpete, Utah. He was christened Lars Peter Christensen 1 June 1880 by Bishop Ole C. Olsen of Mayfield. Soon the name Lars was changed to Louis and in early manhood the middle name Peter was discarded in favor of the initial “D”. For a time Louis also changed the ending of his surname from sen to son, as some of his older brothers had done, but he eventually went back to the original Danish spelling of Christensen, which all of his descendants now use.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Louis was but a few months old his father sold the home in South Mayfield and moved his family into east Gunnison where they lived for a time in a small adobe house owned by his brother-in-law, Lars Myrup. Then his father purchased a large lot in northwest Gunnison, on which stood a small adobe house of two rooms, and into this the family of nine moved and lived in winters so that the older children could attend school. In summers for the next four or five years, however, the family lived mostly on a farm in north Christenburg, midway between Mayfield and Gunnison, which their father had leased from a well-to-do land and stock owner by the name of Julius H. Christensen (no relation). It was here on this farm, with lots of room to roam, that young Louis spent many of his early days. It was while living here on the farm in Christenburg, when he was just under five years old, that he suffered the severe injury to the four fingers of his right hand, which were so badly burned to the knuckles that they could not be saved. It was only through the faith and prayers of members of his family and the never-ending work and care of his doctor-nurse mother, Else K., that the hand proper was preserved.  Even then this seemed like a miracle. More details have been given about this accident earlier in the book. Though knobs finally grew on the stumps of his maimed hand, where the fingers had been, and though Louis later learned to use this <span id="page-607"></span> crippled right hand with great dexterity, it is understandable that this must have been a source of embarrassment and concern to the youngster when he was ready to enter school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A new rock house was soon erected near the old adobe one on the family lot in northwest Gunnison  and into this the family had settled themselves by the time Louis was ready for school. He finished the eighth grade in the public schools of Gunnison but it is doubtful that he continued his formal education  beyond that. At one time he jokingly told his children that his folks managed to get him up to Provo, hoping to enroll him at B.Y.A., but that he climbed through an upstairs window of their living quarters into a tree and got away — Louis was a great joker! Yet it was true he got no college education.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was baptized in the Sanpitch River, some distance from their home in Gunnison, 1 Aug. 1888, by Bishop A. C. Madsen and confirmed next day in church, 2 Aug. 1888, by Thomas Wasden. He was ordained a Deacon 7 May 1893, according to the early Gunnison Ward records. Louis loved music and he had a rich, deep voice. He and his younger brother Arthur used to sing in the ward choir, according to their foster sister, Tresia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis grew to be the tallest and largest of  the Christensen family, which was made up of good sized people, both men and women. A great lot of Danish soup and dumplings must have gone into his making. He inherited a beautiful head of blonde, curly hair. He was husky, strong and vigorous in his youth and full of fun. He loved to play pranks in which he often involved his younger brother Arthur. When Arthur began courting, these jokes and pranks proved to be most annoying to his sweetheart,  Millie, who was pretty sure Lou was leading Arthur “astray”. Their youngest sister, Elvena, was often the victim of these pranks and jokes, being so utterly without guile and trusting like she was.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the Spanish blew up the Maine and the Spanish-American War was declared in early 1898, a number of young men from Gunnison volunteered <span id="page-608"></span> at the first call for troops in Battery C. U.V.A., and Louis was among them. The boys were given quite a “send off” as they left Gunnison depot by train in early July. But when Louis reached Salt Lake City he was told that the complement was filled and was sent home. This was a great disappointment to him and he strongly felt that he was rejected because of his maimed hand, although he was a much better shot with a gun than most of his friends and associates. He was always very sensitive about that crippled hand.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was plenty of work for all at the Christensen  place, with chickens, ducks, pigs, cows to milk, horses and a large vegetable garden and lucerne patch, not to mention the 140 acre farm his father bought which had to be cleared of greasewood,  as well as the other land he operated. But as soon as Louis was old enough to be trusted out with the sheep he was given a job by his brother C. I. and worked several years as one of his  herders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis was ordained an Elder 3 Feb. 1901 and it was anticipated that he would be soon called to serve a mission for the church. However, on March 6 1901 he took Miss Sarah Florence Mellor to the Manti Temple where they had their endowments  and were sealed in marriage for time and eternity. This was on a Wednesday and just two weeks before his twenty-first birthday. Florence, who was from Fayette, was a few months short of her twenty-second birthday. He was large, with curly blond hair and blue eyes. She was dainty and small with dark hair and big brown eyes. Since Florence’s mother had been long dead, Laurs and Else held a wedding party at their home in Gunnison the evening of the marriage, at which a fine wedding supper was served.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis and Florence went to live in the old Mellor home in Fayette where Florence had lived and cared for her younger sisters and brothers since her mother had passed away before she was fourteen. Three months after they were married, Louis received his expected mission call. He was to serve in the Western States Mission. He was set apart for this 11 June 1901, and left soon</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-609"></span> afterwards to labor in Colorado. However, due to the serious illness of his wife, who was expecting their first child, he was soon called home and given an honorable release in order to help take care of her. Florence began to mend and their little daughter, Florence LaFaun, arrived safely and well, 12 Dec. 1901 in Fayette.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Within a short time Louis had made arrangements  to move his family to Gunnison. His brother Arthur, in a letter to his sweetheart Millie, dated 17 Feb. 1902, stated: “Louis bought John Wasden’s place so I guess he will be my neighbor now.” The John Wasden place was across the road south and a few doors to the east of Laurs and Else’s home in northwest Gunnison, and here is where Louis and his family settled for the next few years. This must have been a wise thing to do since Louis was working for his brother Chris at the time and gone so much with the sheep. His parents could look out for his little family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis worked for several years as a herder for his brother C. I. and was for a time in charge of the sheep grazing territory in Twelve Mile Canyon  and surrounding grazing areas. Then in about 1907 he took over operation of a ranch by the Sevier River, west of Gunnison, which his brother Albert had purchased, and moved his family, now enlarged by the addition of two sons, into the poorly equipped farm house that place afforded. Rex was the baby then and rather sickly. Florence had many worries being so far away from a doctor with him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime Arthur had married and had gone into the sheep business with Albert and Louis worked for them with the sheep when he was not tied with the ranch, which he managed for a couple of years. He and Arthur took care of the herds on the west desert during the winters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The first of the year 1909 Louis’ parents decided to move to Manti where they could be near the temple. They were also planning a trip back to Old Denmark to see their relatives and search out more of their genealogy. They suggested that Louis buy their home in Gunnison. After having had the sad experience of losing their fourth child, <span id="page-610"></span> a baby son Spencer, in May of 1908, Louis and Florence must have been grateful for the opportunity to move into the comfortable rock house in which Louis had grown to manhood, and accepted eagerly. The old Gunnison Ward records list Laurs and Else Christensen’s membership as having been transferred  from Gunnison to Manti in early February 1909, so it must have been about that time that Louis moved his family into the old home. It was here their next three children were born.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis continued to work with Arthur with the sheep, wintering on the.west desert and in Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months. They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina. It was on Cedar Mt. that Louis was taken seriously ill, Arthur’s brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill, tells of this: “I was with Lou on Cedar Mt. when he had a stroke. I rode to Gunnison that night for help and Lou was taken to town. Jake Sorensen from Manti came down with us. If I remember correctly this was in July 1910. Louis had become very heavy and had high blood pressure. He was ill for quite a while after that.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arthur and Albert turned their sheep into the Bennion Livestock Company later that same summer,  and they were driven up into the Weber River area in northeastern Utah, where their brother Chris then had his interests in connection with the Bennion Livestock Company, of which he was  co-owner and general manager. Back on his feet again, Louis was given employment by his brother Chris with the same company. December 1913 found him with a herd of sheep near Lyman, Wyoming,  which area was to play so great a part in the remainder of his life. He took up 640 acres of homestead land not far from Lyman in January 1915, close to some property owned by his brother Chris. His sister Elsie Bartholomew homesteaded some land near his at the same time, as did his brother Chris’ oldest daughter Pearl. Later his brother Andrew and his sister Elvena also took up some land in the same vicinity and the entire acreage  owned by the Christensens came to be known by them as “The Oasis”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis moved his family from Gunnison to <span id="page-611"></span> Wyoming in March of 1916. He then had six living children, the youngest and second daughter, Alice, being less than two years old. His sister Elsie took her five children and moved to Wyoming at the same time. The night before they left Gunnison  they all stayed at their sister Emma’s, who lived but a mile from the Gunnison depot, from which they all left by train the next morning, 27 Mar. 1916. Both families lived in two rooms of the four-roomed cabin that Chris had built on his place on The Oasis until cabins could be built on their property. This was the first project to be attempted that spring and soon Louis and his family and Elsie and hers were housed in their own log and frame cabins on the Wyoming ranch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The story of the next few years in Wyoming was like something out of a Western movie mystery and as full of intrigue. Desperados tried to force the Christensens off their land by stealing their stock, burning their crops and setting fire to their homes; during which time the beloved brother Chris became an innocent victim of this range war and died 5 Oct. 1917. The story of those nerve-wracking  years has been told in detail in an earlier chapter of this history, titled “Wyoming Interlude”. Eventually all of the Christensens sold out their holdings on The Oasis or let them go for taxes, except Louis, who chose to remain in the area and “face the music” as it were. He moved his family into Lyman where, having been deputized at the time of all the trouble on his ranch, he became active in the law enforcement of the region. He bought out the property of his deceased brother Chris on The Oasis and his holdings there then totaled some 882 acres and the four roomed cabin built by Chris, which his family used from time to time. He continued to farm on the ranch, in between  his duties as deputy sheriff; it was a good place to keep his boys busy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Life was not easy for Louis or his family that winter following Chris’ death. Rumors about the burning of the crops and the killing and other outrages on the ranch were flying thick and fast. Some people were friendly to the Christensens and some were unfriendly and even suspicious. The <span id="page-612"></span> private detective who had been hired to investigate the trouble and came out for six months, with his traps, clamps, guns, saddles and other gear, masquerading as a trapper, was busy at his work and sometimes stirring up more trouble for the Christensens than help, it seemed. Known as Operative #209 this Mr. Davis set up and serviced his traps and then appeared to loiter in saloons, stores, sheep camps, ranches, town dances or any place he could secretly take the pulse of public or private opinion. He operated mainly in the areas of the mostly Mormon community of Lyman and the somewhat anti-Mormon one of Mountain View, some miles apart in Uinta County in the Bridger Basin of Wyoming. He sent in his reports to his superiors weekly, and abstracts from a few of these give an indication of the opinions he was able to glean: (For obvious reasons only initials are used here for most names. )</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Jan. 1, 1918 - Opr. finds that there is a great deal of talk right now about the Christensen burnings. It seems that everybody has the same opinion and one and all connect the name “H” with the burnings. There was an article in the Bridger Valley Enterprize recently giving a list of people who had contributed towards a fund for Mr. Christensen that he might rebuild his home again, and you can be sure none of the “H” gangs names were there, though the petition was said to have been presented to them… I rode over from Lyman south to Smith Fork and set up a few traps, then rode over towards Mountain View where Mr. “H” lives. I stayed overnight at the ranch of a Mr. “R” who referred to the Christensen fires and said that “The Black Hand” had burned Mr. Christensen’s house twice and caused the shooting of Mr. Christensen’s  brother. He seemed to think it was an outrage and about time the authorities were doing something about it. I asked him if he had any idea who would do such a dastardly trick. He said no one seemed to know positively but that the Christensens  had taken up a good deal of government land formerly used by Mr. “H” as a lambing ground and that a great many people in the county were of the opinion that “H” is the man who is responsible for the fires… All the interviews I have had with <span id="page-613"></span> people here so far, they all seem to think very well of Mr. Christensen but hold a contrary opinion of Mr. “H”. People say that “H” has a fine wife but that he is a regular would-be outlaw, that he carries  a gun with him continually, and that his boy is as tough as he is. Taking everything into consideration,  Opr. is firmly of the opinion that Mr. “H” is the brains of a pretty bad gang here and everything would indicate that this gang did the Christensen burnings.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Operative was anxious to get closer to that “H” gang but made no headway until he hit upon a certain plan. It had been reported to him that Mr. “H” had been circulating the rumor that Opr. was a German spy. The general talk was that it was very necessary to be on the lookout for spies, for it would be easy for anyone to go up in the mountains  and put poison in the creeks which would in turn poison all the stock and people. Following his new plan, in a conspiracy with the Uinta County officials, Opr. #209 had himself arrested as a suspected spy and was taken into custody by Deputy Sheriff L. D. Christensen. The Bridger Valley Enterprize carried the news under the heading  “Arrested as a German Spy Suspect” and it read thus: “On complaint of Mayor C. G. Youngberg  of Lyman District Attorney Matthews authorized the  arrest of R. L. Davis as a possible German spy. Davis entered the Bridger Valley a few weeks ago as a trapper, but his actions and pro-German statements made Lyman and Mountain View residents suspect him of being an undesirable character. Sunday night the County officers went to Davis’ cabin and searched it but aside from finding five revolvers of the best make and 1500 rounds of ammunition, no incriminating evidence was found. He was arrested on Monday morning and taken as a prisoner to Evanston and turned over to the  Federal authorities for further investigation, which may result in his being interned for the duration of the war at one of the prison camps.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of course Opr. was soon released and went right away to Mountain View, telling all he met there what a “dirty deal” he had been dealt by Christensen and the people of Lyman. His plan <span id="page-614"></span> worked beautifully, for soon most of the “H” gang warmed up to him and even went so far as to invite him to pull his traps in the Lyman and Smith Fork areas and put them around the “H” herds, which he did. Although Mr. “H” himself was very wary, his son soon accepted Opr. as a close associate and soon these two were spending much time together at the sheep camp where the younger “H” seemed to be “hiding out”. Here Opr., from time to time, was able to observe at close hand many little things that led him to believe that the right gang was suspected. For example, there was the time that he accidently ran across the “H” son and his camp tender skating up the canal to opposite the Christensen place, and when he asked them why, they laughed and said they were going to trap muskrats there - “the big kind!” Opr. figured if he hung around there it would just be a matter of time until conclusive evidence could be secured or until some other crimes were attempted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then there were the inflamatory statements that the “H” son made, such as: “If I ever shoot at Christensen at fifty yards it won’t be through his coat but through his body… If Christensen ever does find out who burned his place, I’m going to him with two six-shooters and hold one on him  while I hit him on the head with the other, and if he moves I will plug-him… Besides, Christensen comes out every few days with a new story, sometimes  accusing the cattlemen, then me, then somebody else… .  They haven’t got proof that I done the burning and cannot convict me of it. If they arrest me they had better convict me, for if they don’t Dad will break Christensen”. The “H” son also said from time to time that he believed L. D. Christensen set the fires himself and he told various  stories about where he was the nights of the burnings but none of them jibed. He also said that his father was waiting until some of the homesteaders round about got starved out or disgusted with  home-steading and then he’d buy them out cheap.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In his report at the end of February, Opr. #209 included these statements: “… The people around Lyman have made sore open remarks to the effect that if the guilty parties are arrested <span id="page-615"></span> they should be lynched; and Opr. is of the opinion that all of this is not idle talk and for that reason suggests that proper care be taken in making arrests. Opr. is also of the,opinion that if the arrests are made, the younger ‘H’ will break down under some rapid questioning.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Mar. 5th, after some careful arranging, Mr. “H”, his son, his camp tender and Opr. #209 were arrested and taken by train from Carter to Evanston where they were lodged in the county jail. The next day Opr. was released and went on with his work, while the other three were kept until the 10th and then let out on bail. Mr. “H” said at the time that he didn’t think the authorities had anything definite enough on him to be a serious threat, but let them try to convict him he had plenty of money to protect himself with. But he was careful enough to watch his Ps and Qs for awhile, for he knew his every move was being watched somehow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So the Christensen case stood while the investigation went on into April and May. And though the general feeling towards the “H” gang seemed to be getting worse all the time, new  conflicting rumors appeared that seemed to point in another direction. For example, it now seemed that the case might be bigger than ever and the  work of a Mr. “K” and a Mr. “M” and others of their associates who, it was whispered, had planned to get Mr. “H” in bad and in this way force him to sell out to Mr. “K”. Thus, if they could get Mr. “H” and his crowd out of the country they would then finish Christensen and his relatives by fire and force them out also. Then the range would be open for them all the way to Lyman, and if Mr. “K” bought out the “H” home ranch it would make a good pen ground for their cattle and in that way there would be nothing to prevent them ranging where they would, with pens on either end for feeding. It sounded plausible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A criminal lawyer came out from Salt Lake City and took testimony after testimony under oath, with the assistance of Operative #209. But as has been told in a former chapter, the case never came to trial, the investigator was dismissed and the affair finally dropped. Perhaps none were more <span id="page-616"></span> relieved to have this episode in their lives die a natural death at last than the Christensens.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis was elected Uinta County Sheriff beginning with the election of Nov. 1918, for four two-year terms. He moved his family of ten into the “sheriff’s house” in Evanston, Wyoming. He failed to serve his fourth term as county sheriff however, as he was appointed Wyoming State Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Gov. Nellie Taylor Ross, first woman governor in the United States in the early part of 1925. So he moved his family to Cheyenne, Wyoming, which was the State Capitol, and had his office suite in the capitol building there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christensen family lived in Cheyenne for two years and then returned to live in a nice home in Evanston, Wyoming and Louis continued to serve in law enforcement on a city level. He served in law enforcement in Wyoming at some level or another for nearly thirty years. He was a valuable man in that field. Many criminals crossed his path during those years. His daughter Rose, telling of this, writes: “‘Louis was a big man’ his Bishop said of Dad, ‘with a heart to match’, and I agree. Bishop Rawlins also said of father, ‘There was no one more persistent in tracking down and bringing criminals to justice; yet no one kinder to those he had captured’; and with this I also agree.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Oil was being found in the area about this time and Louis decided he would look for oil on his ranch. A rig was set up and men started to drill on the place. His son Weldon tells of an incident that happened during the drilling: “I guess one of the most exciting things that ever happened to me was the time the big steam boiler blew up on our ranch six miles east of Lyman. Some oil people were drilling for oil on our place. This particular day some drillers were trying to pull some casing or pipe out of the hole they were drilling. After trying and trying, without success, they decided to dynamite it out by sending a homemade bomb on the end of a cable a thousand or so feet down into the hole in hopes of breaking the casing in two and loosing the pipe. The cable was attached to the end of the steam boiler. Several tries were made to</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-617"></span> pull the pipe up with this method, sending down the bombs and then trying another pull on the casing with the rig and steam machine. The bombs were lit on top of the ground and then some of the men had to hold the pipe very steady with pipe wrenches while others screwed the top on the bomb to make it water-tight. There were eight sticks of dynamite in each of these bombs, and as each one would hit the bottom and go off it would send up water and cable into the air for many feet. During this dangerous work the drillers were trying to get more steam out of the old boiler so it could pull harder, although it already showed 180 lbs. on the guage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dad and I, who had been watching this operation, decided to go down to the lower ranch to get a small load of hay. The drillers were still trying for more steam when we returned. We tied our team up near the barn and walked over to the steam boiler to try and get our hands and feet warm, as it was mid-winter and terribly cold. Dad went into the little ‘doghouse’ first, took off his overboots and put his feet up to warm them. He was sitting on a couple of barrels of new oil that were parked in front of the boiler. He called to me, ‘Come on in - it’s nice and warm in here’. I don’t know why, but I had stopped just outside. the ‘doghouse’ door and when Dad called to me, all of a sudden I had a very clear warning or impression that we were to get out of there fast. I yelled back to Dad, ‘Come back out and let’s go quick!’ He looked at me a second and said, ‘OK son, let’s go then’. He didn’t even put his  shoes back on - just picked them up, came out and walked quickly with me to the oil rig in his  stocking feet. As we entered the rig-house the driller laughed at him and asked him why the  such-and-such he was running around in his stocking feet. Dad answered that he believed in ‘hunches’ and when he had seen the look on my face as I  yelled at him to get out of the ‘doghouse’, he had a hunch he better do as lasked. Well, just then my brother Rex and the two other drillers came into the rig-house from outside the rigs, making it so that all six of us were then in the rig-house which was built of planks and heavy tin. It was a <span id="page-618"></span> good thing that we were all in there because just then the steam boiler blew up, completely destroying  the ‘doghouse’, partially blowing out the walls of the offside of the rig-house and shooting steam and hot water in all directions. The tin part of the rig-house had protected us from the steam and hot water and from most of the explosion,  and later we were able to crawl out of the break in the rig-house on the lumber side. I have never forgotten the feeling that came as a warning to me that day and we all knew at the time that we had been protected by a heavenly power far beyond our understanding.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaFaun writes; “Father spent so much money drilling unsuccessfully for oil on his 882 acre ranch that he lost the ranch and also his pretentious home in Lyman. He and the family were forced to move to a modest place in another part of Lyman, which mother tried to make more pleasant by surrounding it with beautiful shrubs and flowers.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon their eight children all married and left home, or left home and married, as the case happened to be, and Louis and Florence were left to live modestly in their little home in Lyman. Of the eight, only Weldon chose to spend his married years in Lyman and eventually built a home for his family next door to his parents. The others came home quite often and were always welcomed with open arms, and Louis and Florence went to visit their out-of-town children on occasions,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Florence passed away in Ruth, Nevada, 24 Nov. 1952. She was brought back to Lyman for burial. Left alone, Louis lived by himself in Lyman, with Weldon and his wife next door to sort of look after him when he was there. But he was very lonely and restless and his eyes were giving him trouble, due to a diabetic condition. He was forced to use a cane when he went places, to be more sure of his step. He began to travel quite a bit each month and LaFaun tells of this: “The last few years of father’s life he traveled almost  continually, first to California to see Rose, then to Nevada to see Alice and Marjorie, then to Salt Lake City to see me, and then on to Nampa, Idaho to see Dale and Ruby, as long as Dale was alive. <span id="page-619"></span> Then he would go back to Lyman to pay current bills, then he’d start the travel routine again. I used to drive him from Salt Lake home to Lyman about every other week and clean his house through for him. I always drove up to Lyman and back on Saturdays as I had to be back to Salt Lake for Sunday  church commitments and back to work on Monday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On Saturday, the last of January 1959, I drove father home to Lyman. When we entered the house the bathroom floor was partially torn up, a strange tie was on the buffet and the quilts I always used to make a bed on the davenport were gone. Father looked in the closet and said his gun was gone too. I was upset and worried. Many convicts  had threatened his life over the years. I begged him to come back home with me but he refused, saying he had to pay current utility bills on Monday. Monday night I phoned him from Salt Lake to see if he was alright, as I was so worried for fear someone had been in his house who meant trouble. But father said he was Ok.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weldon writes: - “Dad had been one of the best sheriffs Evanston or Lyman ever had and his record in Evanston proved it. He destroyed more stills during those bootlegging days than any other law enforcement agent. (We have pictures of stills being destroyed by him.) But you know, there were people calling him up on the phone during his last days. His phone would ring and when he’d answer ‘Hello’ there would be no answer. I know this to be a fact as I was at his house and close to the phone on two separate occasions when calls came. I have no idea how many calls of this kind Dad had, but it was evident that someone was trying  to frighten or confuse him. We wondered if it was some of the people he had arrested over the years who had threatened at the time to ‘get him’ or ‘to get even’. It was a constant worry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One night Beth, my wife, and I saw the shadow of someone walking between Dad’s house and ours. We could see Dad through his lighted window walking around inside his house and there was the outline of someone walking between our house and his lighted window. Beth and I took out <span id="page-620"></span> after this shadow - but it got away through the lilac bushes and over the fence before we could get to it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On Feb. 5, 1959, Dad visited with me at my house, as he often did when he was home in Lyman. He seemed the same as usual - very relaxed and calm. He talked to me for a couple of hours then I guess, while I cleaned my day’s gathering of eggs. He told me at this time that he had dreamed about mother, his earnestness showing in his face. He seemed a little embarrassed to tell of something so close to his heart. He said that in this dream, or whatever it was, it seemed as though mother was standing in front of him, her feet not touching the floor. He said her being there didn’t seem like a dream but a reality and he was so happy to see her that he began crying a little and then said to her: ‘Hello Sweetheart’. She answered, ‘Hello Lou - I’m  going to bring you a present in a little while dear’. He said, ‘Oh darling, all I want is you!’ At this mother smiled a little and then just faded away. ‘I don’t know what she meant’, said Dad then, ‘but it surely seemed good to see her.’ Then he looked over at me and said he hoped he hadn’t worried or embarrassed me by telling me of this and I told him I was glad he had. Dad then said, ‘It’s time you fed your chickens for night isn’t it?’ I looked up at the clock - it was 3:30 p.m. ‘Yes, I guess I’d better feed them and then go up and get Beth from work’, I said, and then we both left the house, he going towards his house and I out to the coops to feed the chickens. ‘Well, I’ll see you later dear’ he said and I answered, ‘Ok, and I’ll see you’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next morning, Feb, 6, 1959, I had been to work at the school house (driving bus) and had also taken Beth there to her work. I usually gathered my eggs three times a day to cut down on breakage, so I went out to the coop to gather eggs. As I walked across the floor to the far end of the coop I spotted an egg on the floor. I had stooped over to pick it up when the strangest feeling of foreboding came over me - like the time the boiler blew up on the ranch. I don’t know how long I stood there puzzled, knowing something was wrong somewhere, when suddenly I walked out of the coop <span id="page-621"></span> without finishing gathering the eggs, set my bucket down and went straight over to Dad’s house. I knocked but there was no answer so I stepped inside  and called to Dad - but there was still no answer. I went hastily to his bedroom. It was dark there as the blinds were down as usual. I turned on the light and froze stiff. There was my father on his bed - dead. He had been shot and a gun was in his own hand. Finally I gathered my stunned senses together and looked the situation over very carefully without moving from the spot. I started to cry and then got out of there and went to find Beth and then ask some people to call the sheriff at Evanston and also the coroner. They put it down as a suicide but I myself will never believe that it was. I can’t prove anything but I just know that it wasn’t, without a doubt.” After appropriate and beautiful funeral services, Louis was buried beside his beloved wife in the Lyman Cemetery, 9 Feb. 1959.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their daughter Alice wrote: - “I have had the grandest father, mother, sisters and brothers on earth - just a marvelous home life with them.” And their daughter Rose concludes this history by writing: - “From my sentimental, loving Dad I think I might have inherited my love for music. Always I shall remember his rich, deep voice reflecting his moods - to awaken us in the  mornings - to entertain us while he sat and chorded  his own accompaniment - to rock me to sleep until I was so tall he’d turn sideways to get me through the door while I pretended to be asleep.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He had a fine sense of humor and keen perception  with his love of people. We used to have wonderful discussions on countless subjects and were great friends. He had the air of sweet dignity and old-fashioned courtliness that is seldom seen today. Wherever I’ve gone, someone has remembered him and gone out of their way to help me because of it. I rented a room in Santa Monica, Calif. at one time from an old woman who, I found out later, was from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and who said Dad had captured the murderer of her grocer-husband - she couldn’t do enough for me after she found out who I was. This is typical of <span id="page-622"></span> what I mean.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In spite of his size, my Dad never was ashamed to show and speak of his love for his family. I have many letters I treasure from him in which he speaks of his great love and pride in us all. He was a wonderfully kind and loving  father, with a heart that couldn’t say ‘no’ to anyone in need. My girls called him ‘Big Grandpa’ and were surprised to find that he also knelt to pray; I guess they thought only we smaller people needed the guidance of a higher power.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sarah Florence Mellor (Christensen), wife of Louis “D” Christensen, was born 4 July 1879 in Dover, a very small pioneer Mormon community a short distance west of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah, but no longer in existence. She was the daughter of James Mellor Jr. and Charlotte Elizabeth Dack (Mellor) early Utah Mormon pioneers of English extraction. The Mellor family soon moved from Dover to Fayette and became prominent members of that Mormon community.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Florence attended the public schools available at the time in Fayette, and it is doubtful if she  obtained any more formal schooling. But she became well taught in the school of life, for before she was fourteen her mother died and her father, being a polygamist, went to live with his other wife, leaving young Florence in charge of four younger brothers and sisters and with only the minimum of help from him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Florence soon learned the arts of running a pioneer home with all the intricacies of rug making, soap making, butter making, bread making, candle making, etc. If she often learned the hard way, being without the instruction of her precious mother, yet she learned and became a good cook, a competent  seamstress and a fine homemaker. She learned to be frugal and “make ends meet” - there were no other dependable ways of survival in those early days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Florence was a beautiful girl, rather small of stature, with wavy dark brown hair and big brown <span id="page-623"></span> eyes. She was gentle, kind and loving by  nature - sympathetic and understanding. She was quiet and soft-spoken and she had almost unending patience. She was very religious, with an abundance of faith, hope and charity that helped mold her into an outstanding  wife and mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She was courted and won by Louis Christensen,  a large, curly-headed handsome fellow of Danish parentage who lived in northwest Gunnison along the main road that then ran from Gunnison to Fayette, about six miles distance. The wedding date was set. Florence and her younger sister made her wedding dress of white “china silk”. Florence saved this dress and later used the material to make a “christening robe” for her first daughter, Florence LaFaun. The marriage of Florence and Louis took place in the beautiful Manti Temple, Wed. 6 Mar. 1901. A lovely wedding reception was held for them by the parents of Louis, Laurs and Else K. Christensen, in their home in Gunnison that same evening.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis came to make his home in her childhood home in Fayette, but within three months he was called to serve a mission for the church in Colorado, leaving Florence in rather poor health as we have learned. Her condition worsened and though her mother-in-law, Else K., who was a doctor and nurse, did all she could to assist her, it was thought wise to have Louis called home to be with her and help in her care, and to be on hand for the birth of their first child, LaFaun, born 12 Dec. 1901 in the old Mellor home in Fayette.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Fayette Florence and Louis and child moved to the Wasden home across the road south of Laurs and Else’s in Gunnison, where two other children were born to them, both boys, Lucien and Rex. Else was always on hand to help deliver the new babies and to care for them and the mother. Florence must have felt lost without her kind and efficient mother-in-law nearby when they moved west a mile or so onto a ranch while Rex was still a baby.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis was away a lot with the sheep and Rex was sickly and hemorrhaged easily and often. <span id="page-624"></span> LaFaun tells that at such times her mother would almost despair, alone in the poorly equipped farm house the ranch afforded, with only the three little ones and no neighbors or help within a mile or more. She would do all that she knew how to do to help the child and then gather the two older children to her and kneel beside the baby’s bed and pray earnestly for help from the Heavenly Father. LaFaun says she will never forget those prayers for help, and feels sure that her mother pulled little Rex through with faith and prayers. She can still hear the lullaby her mother sang to him as she sat and rocked and rocked and rocked him in her arms to comfort and soothe him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another little boy was born to Florence and Louis and they named him Spencer. But they were not permitted to raise this little one and he passed away within five weeks, 6 May 1908. They then moved back to Gunnison into Louis’ childhood home, which his parents vacated in preparation for a trip back to Denmark. In this comfortable rock house three more babies were born, two boys and a girl.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though Louis was gone with the sheep a great deal, life in the rock house was more pleasant, the church and school were nearby and the older children  were getting to be some help. Then Louis took up homestead land near Lyman, Wyoming and decided to move the family there. So bag and baggage they all bid Gunnison farewell and took the train for Wyoming, 27 Mar. 1916, together with Louis’ sister Elsie C. Bartholomew and her five children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Life on the frontiers of Wyoming was not an easy one, especially while living on and developing the ranch to meet homesteading requirements. The first two and a half years were especially difficult ones, since unknown but unscrupulous persons who coveted the range they were taking up tried to run them off their property by burning down their ranch home twice and devious other ways - leaving them in a state of constant upset.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Louis was elected county sheriff and they moved into Evanston, Wyoming and later when he was appointed State Commissioner of Law Enforcement and they lived in Cheyenne, things <span id="page-625"></span> were a little easier. Two more daughters had been added to the family however, making eight living children in all to call Florence mother. When reverses came, sometime after returning to Lyman to live and the family were forced to seek more modest quarters, Florence’s flower garden and shrubs brightened their surroundings and their lives and even drew the attention of many flower lovers in the area. LaFaun writes: - “Mother’s  flowers and gardens proved attractive to many people and particularly to a number from the extension division of the University of Wyoming, as flowers, fruits and shrubs that it was supposedly not possible to grow in Wyoming were grown in her well kept yard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“She was always an outstanding mother and homemaker. Besides raising her four brothers and sisters she raised eight children of her own and buried one. Her wise budgeting of expenses kept the family on an even keel for many, many years.” Though blessed with many talents she made that of homemaking and motherhood her greatest goal in life and it was indeed her glory.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Florence was in rather poor health the last few years of her life. When at last it was too difficult for her to take care of herself, or for Louis to either, she went to be with some of her married daughters, a few months with Rose in Santa Monica, Calif., and then with Marjorie in Ruth, Nevada. It was while in Ruth that she passed away, 24 Nov. 1952.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Gleaned from her funeral card is the  following: - “In memory of Sarah Florence Christensen, born July 4th 1879, Dover, Utah; passed away November 31, 1952, Ruth, Nevada. The time and place of services - Mon. Nov. 24, 1952, 2 p.m. Lyman Grade School auditorium. Services conducted  by Bishop Merrill B. Asay. Final Resting Place - Lyman Cemetery. Arrangements by  Gilbert Bills Mortuary.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Her daughter Rose wrote: - “I hope that I have inherited some of my mother’s outstanding qualities - her spiritual strength and courage; her love for the Gospel and the church, for her children <span id="page-626"></span> and family, for flowers and animals. She was kind and sweet to everyone. She spent two months with us before her death and never did she complain about the crippling, painful arthritis she had and the discomfort of the edema which was to take her life. Instead of taking the pain pill the doctor had given her, each night she would ask me to lift the venetian blind on the door so she could see the flowers outside. They were so beautiful to her that they made her forget her pain. She especially enjoyed the moonlit nights. She was one of those ‘green thumbers’ who could grow anything, and her own yard had always been a showplace for the town. Her mother had died when she was not much more than twelve and her life had been a hard one, but she was never bitter. Her faith and love helped us all. She was always a real friend to me and we enjoyed so many hours together as long as she lived.”</p>
