  <h2 class="calibre9" id="ada-peterson">Ada Peterson</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(26) Ada Peterson (6) was born 13 Jan. 1906 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Her brother Byron remembers her as very athletic as a girl and how she could ride horses bareback as good as most boys. He remembers she was the catcher on the school baseball team. She was a sister after his own heart and a good substitute for a brother, of which he had none. They were great pals!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ada writes of herself:— “I attended grade school, high school and Seminary in Gunnison. I graduated from high school in 1926, having failed to graduate with my own class of ‘25 due to mother’s illness. During these years I taught in Primary and was Sunday School organist in Gunnison Ward with Clyde C. Edmunds as chorister. I sang in the Gunnison Ward choir under E. L. Swalberg. I sang duets with Emily Knighton at church functions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Gunnison Ward was divided I served as Sunday School Secretary in the new Hamilton Ward for some years. I belonged to a double mixed quartet under Charles E. Ferrie and we were in great demand for church and civic affairs. In High School I belonged to the Glee Club, sang in the opera and sang the lead in a double mixed quartet in competition with other schools. We always had a high rating. Our music teacher was our beloved ElRay Christiansen, now assistant to the Twelve Apostles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After I graduated from High School I worked for the Gunnison Telluride Power Co. as steno-bookkeeper and stock clerk. It was here I met Linden H. Johnson who was manager. We were married 29 June 1928 in the Manti Temple. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-791" title="791"></span> became stepmother to his two children, Francis Dale and Helen Ramona, ages 8 and 5. (Linden Hyrum Johnson was born 15 Sep. 1895 in Huntington, Emery, Utah to Swen Hyrum and Matilda Wilhamina Nelson Johnson).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved to Delta, Utah, May of 1930 where Lin established the Delta branch of the Telluride Power Co. Here I worked in a greater capacity, training new girls and continuing as steno, etc. We lived in Delta twenty-five years and during these years I worked and raised my family. Lin’s and my two children, Ada Bonita and Larry Lynn, were both born in Delta. Dale and Ramona both attended BYU until World War II came and they volunteered - Dale in the Naval Air and Mona as a WAVE.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Lin advanced to Supt. of the Delta Division of Telluride Power Co., I assumed more responsibility as hostess, working on the entertainment committees. Also I was active in church and civic affairs. I attended the Delta 2nd Ward where I was Sunday School Secretary, taught in Sunday School, Primary, MIA, and was a Relief Society visiting teacher. I sang with the ‘Singing Mothers’ under Ladd Cropper and belonged to the Ward choir. I sang as a soloist at funerals. Aside from church activities I was secretary for the American Legion Auxilliary for ten years, for which I was awarded a silver necklace with the American Legion emblem on it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Lin and I belonged to the Fidelity Club, a social organization in which we made many lifelong friends. It was composed of a distinguished group of doctors, lawyers, our Stake president, Seminary teacher, principal of Delta High School, Delta’s Mayor and fine people from all walks of life, sixteen couples of fun-loving people, each with a purpose in life. I entertained many times in our home where I learned to be a hostess. At first I didn’t feel capable of this because I was ten years younger than most and lacked the maturity and experience. My excuse up until we built our new home was always that our place wasn’t large enough. However, when lovely Romania Bird said, ‘Ada dear, where there is heart room there is house room’. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-792" title="792"></span> needed no more assurance - our new home became a center of festivities, I could seat thirty-six people at card tables and we had many lovely parties. Bonita celebrated her fourteenth birthday there before leaving for California to study dance at Hollywood Professional School (‘53-‘56) which one hundred of her classmates attended. In 1948 the Fidelity Club celebrated its 25th anniversary in our home with fifty guests in attendance. There were many happy times during our stay in Delta.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In October of 1955 I left Delta for California to take on a new role as a guest home operator. I called my place ‘Ada’s Guest Home, a home away from home’. One year later Lin and Larry followed, after having sold our beautiful home and furnishings in Delta. The home at 440 South Oxford in Los Angeles was our home for seven years. It was a two-story mansion. An apartment sized kitchen, dining room, bedroom and bath were our personal quarters adjacent to the main home of a kitchen and pantry, beautiful dining area, living room, and a winding oak staircase leading to five king-size bedrooms for our guests, along with two bedrooms and a maid’s room downstairs. There was a separate building of room and bath with picturesque windows, which became Bonita’s music studio.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was while living here that I received my license for six ambulatory guests and with the help of my maid Dessie, a colored woman from the south, achieved an A-1 rating my first year, which I have continued to receive. I have always set a beautiful table for three meals a day with good food. I have cared for both men and women, although most of my guests have been women. At 440 So. Oxford I cared for motion picture people until they built the motion picture country home. Each one had a story to tell. When they came to my home they stopped using tobacco and drinking became a thing of the past for them. Those were very happy and interesting days for all of us. The Lord was good to me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When we sold that home to a builder we moved across the street to 431 So. Oxford, where we are now. We watched them tear down a home we loved, along with a redwood tree for which Mary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-793" title="793"></span> Pickford at one time had offered $150.00 but had been refused by the previous owner. At 431 Oxford I still have my guests and a cook and housekeeper. At present my youngest guest is 75 and my eldest 93. My cook has been with me seven years. She is from Tennessee and her name is Thelma Joyce. She is a real dear. Bonita too has worked with me these last years, and because her disposition is much like mine, the guests have all loved her as well. Her singing and playing of the piano have been appreciated by them also. Her health is now the best she has ever known, since an early back injury caused her years of pain and illness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When our guests demanded more personal care we bought or rented three different homes, one in North Hollywood, where Bonita and Larry enjoyed the swimming pool, and two in Encino, Calif., about twenty minutes drive from our place in Los Angeles. The family home at present is at 409 So. Oxford Ave., where Bonita, who is now married and has a baby daughter, lives along with Lin and me. Our son Larry and family live in Orem, Utah, where he serves as assistant cashier at Orem State Bank, after having graduated from Hollywood High School with high honors and also from Seminary there and later attending BYU in Provo, where he met his lovely wife.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Lin operated a Standard service station here for ten years, for which he was awarded a bronze plaque. He retired in Aug. 1968 and has recently undergone two separate operations at the Veterans’ Hospital, Wilshire and Sawtelle blvd., one for a hernia and one for hemorrhoids. He was released Mar. 15 and is now feeling fine and grateful to have this over with. The Elders were there and administered each time. He has been my painter, plumber and all-around handy man over these last years. What would I have done without him?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We are members of Wilshire Ward, where Lin is a High Priest and very active. Even though I can’t attend regularly, I’m there in spirit and keep up my tithes and offerings, as the Lord has blessed me financially. When I needed guests he has provided. I have not had a sick day in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-794" title="794"></span> thirteen years of my business. For this I am grateful and humble. I always have a prayer in my heart for strength to meet my obligations, and they are many when you care for ten old people on an average every day three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Oh my, I could write a book on the beautiful people I’ve served through these years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In closing I’d like to copy the words on a thank you note from the daughter of an LDS lady I once cared for:- ‘Dear Sister Johnson, It has been an inspiring experience to know you and I appreciate all you have done for mother. It is thrilling to know that the spirit you carry is the one we shall all share in the celestial kingdom and our associations will continue there. It was God’s blessing that we were led to you and may we enjoy always the sweet spirit that is expressed in your home. Sincerely, Cecilia Jensen.’”</p>
