  <p class="calibre1">(10) Christian LeRoy Christensen (1) was born 9 Jan, 1901 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. This was on a Tuesday. Roy, as he was most often called, was the fourth child and second son of the family. He was of a sweet and gentle nature like his mother Caroline, round faced, blonde and inclined to be rather plump as a child, He was baptized a member of the L.D.S. church three days after his eighth birthday, 12 Jan, 1909, in the Manti Temple, undoubtedly being taken there for the occasion by his grandmother, Else K. Christensen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roy started school in Gunnison the fall of 1907. Those were the days when Beginner’s Grade preceded First Grade in most school districts. His family moved to Salt Lake City the summer of 1910, following the death of two of his sisters, Elora, older, and Orilla just younger than he. Here he started Third Grade in the Roosevelt grade school about a mile from their lovely home on 27th South 9th East, which his father had purchased from his brother Andrew. Roy attended school at Roosevelt through eighth grade and that was the end of his formal schooling. But he continued to read a lot, for he loved books.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From 1910 on most of the summers of his youth were spent on the Weber Ranch in northeastern Utah, along with others of his family. After his schooling was over, however, he began alternating with his older brother Elmer at some sheep camp owned by the Bennion Livestock Company, of which his father was part owner and <span id="page-700"></span> general manager, or taking care of his father’s land on The Oasis, not far from Lyman, Wyoming. It was here on The Oasis that he spent the summer and fall of 1917, along with his sister Pearl, and where they became involved in the unforeseen and heartbreaking circumstances of their beloved Father’s accident and death. Details of this have been related earlier in this book.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roy says that following his Father’s death Uncle Lou Christensen bought their property there on The Oasis and paid for it as soon as he could. He himself went back to Salt Lake City with his mother and his younger brothers and sister. He was then nearing seventeen but too young to serve in World War I, then in progress. He became his mother’s mainstay, working around as he could until 1922 when he went to Nevada with his older sister Pearl and her husband Peter Jensen, and worked in the mines in Eureka, Nevada for six months. Then he went to McGill, Nevada and worked until 1929, at which time he returned to Salt Lake City to be near his mother. Being unable to find work in Salt Lake to his liking, he returned to McGill and has worked there ever since.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not all heros are in uniform and it will surely be to Roy’s eternal credit that he took care of his mother to the best of his ability throughout all those years, as long as she lived. He shared his monthly checks with her and did all else he could for her happiness. His younger brother Farrald says they just couldn’t have gotten along in the home then without the help Roy gave them. Roy may still have blamed himself for his father’s untimely death, though circumstances entirely absolved him, but a less sensitive and less dedicated soul would have wearied of the long grind and gone his own way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roy married a widow, Luella Ernstsen Bennett, in Ely, Nevada 23 Dec. 1938, just two and a half years before his mother’s death. He was within two and a half weeks of his thirty-eighth birthday at the time and she was within a week of her twenty-eighth. Luella writes of him: - “I met Roy in McGill when I first came here in January of 1930, being a small town everyone <span id="page-701"></span> knew everyone. My first husband and I lived in McGill from soon after our marriage in 1929 until he died, except for two years in Fillmore, Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had three sons, five, seven and nine, when Roy and I were married. He has been a good husband and a wonderful father. He deserves much credit. My boys love him very much and remember no other father, since their own father died when they were pretty young. Our own son, Christian LaVell, was born in McGill the early part of 1940.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We are pretty proud of our boys, they have given us little trouble. The oldest is a heavy-duty mechanic in Salt Lake City; the second is a sales manager in Salt Lake; the third has graduated from medical school at the University of Utah and is now doing his intern; and Chris, as we call our youngest, is now working in electronics in Richland, Washington. We have four lovely daughters-in-law and many beautiful grandchildren. Roy himself works for the Kennecott Company here in McGill as a pipefitter. He hopes to retire when he is sixty-eight (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We own our own home in McGill, a duplex, live in one side and rent the other. We both enjoy good health except for a little arthritis. Roy used to enjoy fishing and hunting but doesn’t do much of that any more, since he gets short winded when he walks very far. He enjoys working in the yard and flowers. We don’t do much traveling as we try to avoid traffic and big crowds. We have made several trips to Los Angeles and San Diego, several to Reno, Carson City, Virginia City, and to Piermont Lake in Nevada. We have also visited Yellowstone Park, Capitol Reef in southern Utah, and Lake Tahoe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Like Roy’s, my father’s parents were emigrants from Denmark who came to Zion for the Gospel. My father, Ove Ernstsen, also born in Denmark, is still living at 86 and has his own home in Salt Lake City. His father lived to be 90. There were eleven children in our family, nine girls and two boys. Nine are still living. I myself was born 30 Dec. 1910 in Loa, Utah and moved to Salt Lake when I was fourteen. I attended Granite High School there but quit in my third year and <span id="page-702"></span> went to work, I met and married my first husband there in 1929, I have worked off and on for years in cafes in McGill and Ely as a cook, but haven’t the past year or so due to arthritis. I enjoy sewing very much and make all my granddaughters’ dresses, I am 5 ft. 3 inches high, weigh 123 lbs. and have brown hair and eyes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roy is 5 ft. 8 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. He has light hair and hazel eyes. Though his education was limited he has read and studied a lot and is a very intelligent man, He has many friends and apparently no enemies. He doesn’t have much time for hobbies at present but enjoys our color TV and card parties at the Elks Lodge twice a month. Since we have so many friends in McGill and Ely, we hope to continue to make our home here after his retirement and plan a few trips by plane. We want to visit my sister in Connecticut and many of the ghost towns in Nevada.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roy has not adopted the three Bennett boys, sons of his wife and her first husband, Clarence LeRoy Bennett - Merlyn LeRoy, Ernest Eugene and Derral Duane, who are all married. But they are very close to him as he is to them and their families. He and Luella Ernsten have but the one son of their own: -</p>
