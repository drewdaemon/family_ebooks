  <p class="calibre1">(59) Tresia Clark (9} was born 28 May 1922 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Her birth took place on her uncle Albert Christensen’s ranch a mile or so west of town in the small farmhouse there, since her father was then serving as foreman on the ranch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia writes about herself:- “A few months after my birth in Gunnison our family moved to Goshen, Utah to live. It was here I started school when I became of age. In early spring of my second year of school we moved to Santaquin, Utah where Father had bought a lot of the southwest corner of a block there and at first we rented a house on the southeast corner of that same block until Dad had enough of our house finished on our new lot to move in. Here we only had lanterns to see by at nights for some weeks and I remember how wonderful it seemed when we got electricity into the house. I also remember spending hours and hours moving rocks from the ground before Dad could plant our garden. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I finished the ninth grade of school in Santaquin and then started high school in Payson, traveling back and forth by school bus. But I dropped out of school before Christmas of that year. I remember Uncle Albert Christensen took me over to his home in Orem during the Christmas vacation and talked to me about how important an education was. At the time I half promised to return to school the beginning of the new year an but I never did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On Easter Sunday, the next spring, my oldest sister, Vera, was married (1938). I was <span id="page-926"></span> with a group of young friends in a car when we had a terrible accident. A drunk, driving another car, ran into us. My sister Alta was among those in the back seat but was not seriously injured, as some of the others of us were. I was sitting in the front seat and was badly injured and not expected to live for about a week. My face was cut almost from ear to ear and other damage. I was unconscious for quite a period. When I first saw my father, after regaining consciousness, I told him that I was concerned that he and Mother had not been to the Temple to be sealed for eternity. This seemed to have been constantly on my mind after the accident. I recalled Mother worrying about my sisters Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she and Dad got around to having us children sealed to them. I exacted a promise from Dad at that time that he would prepare to have his and Mother’s temple work done before my eighteenth birthday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My parents did prepare themselves and were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in Manti and have their temple work done and us younger children sealed to them the very day before my eighteenth birthday, 27 Mar. 1940. I know how happy they will be when all of their children are  sealed to them and we can all look forward to being together in the world where they have gone. They made many sacrifices for us; the least we can do  now for them is to prepare ourselves by righteous living to join them as a family in the eternity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1940 I started a course under Margaret. P. Maw at the Provo School of Beauty Culture and graduated from there 15 Dec. 1941. I worked for a year as a beautician in Fillmore, Utah and then for a time in Helper, Utah. I also did the same kind of work in Murray, Utah after my marriage. I later went to Salt Lake City and worked in a war plant (radio tube plant).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was while working in Salt Lake City that I met my future husband, Max Andrew Rosenlund (b. 20 Mar. 1926 in Fairview, Utah to Paul Andrew and Annie Darthea Peterson Rosenlund).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Max and I first met in February of 1945 and were married the following October 23rd in <span id="page-927"></span> Evanston, Wyoming, where my parents had been married, We lived in Murray, Utah for a number of years and then bought our present home at 6871 Springbrook Way in Salt Lake City. We have had two sons and three daughters and are so grateful for each of them. We also had my sister Alta’s son Terry in our home for several years until he went into the service. Max and I went through the Salt Lake Temple and had our five children sealed to us, 10 Dec. 1960.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I started working at the Mode O’Day factory in 1944 and am working there at the present time. I have worked off and on all during my married life. My husband Max and our eldest son, Wayne, and I have gone into the part-time business of upholstering  and we are doing quite well. We recently built the booths for the Oakridge Country Club. Max built the booths, Wayne did the upholstering and I did the sewing. It was a beautiful job, if I do say so, and we have had a number of calls from other interested parties and have a couple of jobs to bid on now. My favorite hobby, besides my family and the church, is sewing. At present we are  repainting and refurnishing our home and I have been making new bedroom drapes and also new ones for the kitchen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have been a Sunday School teacher for the past eight or nine years. We now live in the  Butler 5th Ward, Butler Stake. I am veryanxious to get started on my genealogy. I don’t know the first thing about this work but I’m determined to learn. Our oldest daughter Karen attended BYU at Provo this past school year and took classes in this subject. She too is interested in genealogy and perhaps together we can do something about our own. My main desire in life is to stay close to the church, live by its teachings, and raise | righteous children.”</p>
