  <p class="calibre1">(48) Alice Fern Christensen (7) was born 14 Apr. 1914 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. She lacked less than a month from turning two years old when she moved with her parents to a ranch near Lyman, Wyoming. She attended grade and high school at Lyman, Evanston and Cheyenne, Wyoming, graduating from Lyman High School the spring of 1931.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alice became an accomplished singer and pianist. At one time she and her sister Marjorie sang over the radio on their own program listed as “Alice &amp; Marj”. She has played and sung in night clubs and with bands. She herself writes of this:- “I have worked at playing the piano in town bands, night clubs, at style shows, luncheons, and for Rotarians, Elks, Jaycees, etc. I also worked at typing, my main job being with the Federal Civil Service at the Sacramento Signal Depot (procedure section) where in one year and two months I achieved my goal by obtaining an Outstanding Efficiency award as well at a Sustained Superior award, which is considered quite an achievement in Federal Civil Service.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 3 Nov. 1941, in Las Vegas, Nevada, I was married to McNeil Frandsen (b. 23 Sep. 1915 in Elsinore, Utah to Alma F. and Petrea Nielson Frandsen). We had a very happy marriage but after twenty years and four months as man and wife he died of cancer at Reno, Nevada, 10 Mar. 1962, after having suffered with this terrible disease for one year and two months. He was buried 13 Mar. 1962 in Reno. After his death my former boss at the Signal Depot in Sacramento, Robert G. Farrell, made three different trips to Reno to try and get me to go back there to work, but I didn’t.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I began playing dinner hour music at the Nevada Hotel in Ely, Nevada, and that is where I met my second husband, Joseph Robert Burns, who was a cook and chef in Elko. We were married in Elko 16 Jan. 1964. Later we moved to Tonapah, Nevada where he did the same kind of work and I played the piano at the ‘Tonapah Club’ there two nights a week. I want you to know that I have had the grandest mother, father, sisters and brothers on earth - just a marvelous home life in my youth.” <span id="page-881"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alice and Joseph Burns were finally divorced and she moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. She is at present working at the University of Utah Printing Department doing studies computing. She has no descendants.</p>
