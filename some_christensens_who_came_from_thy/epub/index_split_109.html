  <h2 class="calibre9" id="george-fern-clark">George Fern Clark</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(63) George Fern Clark (9) was born 21 Nov. 1924 in Goshen, Utah, Utah, the first son in the family after four daughters. When he was nearly five and a half his father bought a lot in Santaquin and moved the family there. It was here that he attended grade school and Junior High. He then went to Payson to High School but only went a year and a half, quitting about a half year before graduation in order to work, since he felt in great need of money for the extra things boys need and desire, there being very little for those things at home..</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George joined the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) which was activated during the depression years. During the two years he was thus employed he worked at seven different camps in Utah, including the Cedar Breaks and Zion Park areas. Then he got a job as a night porter in Walgren Drug in Sait Lake City and then with the Bamberger Railroad helping to remove ties from Center Street in Provo. The urges of youth to see more of the world began working on him at this point, as they did upon one of his boy friends, and the two of them took off for Nevada to find work and ended up in Red House, where they worked in a smelter until they had enough money to go on in the Model A Ford they were driving. The two went then to Reno, Nevada for a little lark and here they “went broke” and had to work a month and a half to make enough money to go on to California. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-951" title="951"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">They toured Hollywood in their old Ford and other points of interest in the Los Angeles area, and then foolishly spent their last cent at a carnival and were broke again. They got a job in an orchard picking oranges. They worked one morning and were “doing great” when the foreman came along and found that their speed was due to the fact that they were picking oranges like they picked apples, and oranges would soon spoil under those conditions. They were taught to “cut” the stem of the orange from the tree instead of pulling the fruit off, which they then proceeded to do, but found this method so slow and tedious that they quit at the end of two hours of this latter. Anyway, they had decided to hit for home. They made enough on the orange-picking, however, to enable them to fill up with gas and sandwiches for the homeward journey. But in Scipio in southern Utah they ran out of gas and food and “hocked” their wrist watches, alarm clock and a spare tire to get enough of the needed supplies to get back to Santaquin.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then George went into the mines with his father and worked in the Tintic Standard and North Lily mines near Dividend, Utah, where they mined zinc and silver. He had worked here for about a year and a half when World War II involved the U.S.A. and the call came for fighting men. George wanted to “join up” first thing and planned to get into the air force, in spite of his mother’s pleading and weeping. But then he discovered that he was frozen to his job in the mines. This was a blow!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All his friends were joining up and as George went to the mines each day he felt resentful and like a regular traitor or “scab”. No one could convince him that he was being patriotic by staying in the mines. This was a period of frustration for him. He was determined to get into the armed services somehow and at last he hit upon a plan. He simply stayed home from his work in the mines for about six weeks and it worked - he was drafted. He was nearing his nineteenth birthday in November of 1943 when he left for the war.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George got into the Air Force all right but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-952" title="952"></span> not as a pilot. Had he known what was ahead of him he would have surely ceased his clambering to be in the armed services and stayed home in his safer place in the mines. His boot training took place at Buckley Field near Denver, Colorado; his gunnery training of three months was had at an Air Force center near Las Vegas, Nevada; his flight training was given at an Air Force Base in Dyersburg, Tennessee and it was here that he was assigned to the 92nd Bombing crew of nine in the 8th U. S. Air Force Division. From then on this crew stayed together and went from Tennessee by train to Kearney, Nebraska and from thence to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, which was their port of embarkation. They sailed on the troop transport U.S.S. Wendell L. Wilkie and disembarked at a port in Scotland and went from there to an air base in England where they arrived about June 1944.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was assigned as “waist gunner” on their bomber and took up his position in the center part of that plane when bombing missions were flown. Each member of the crew carried with him, besides his other equipment and parachute, a small kit encased in plastic, containing a knife, some first aid supplies and the equivalent of about fifty dollars in currency of the country over which they were to fly. They were strictly schooled in the tactics they should use in case they found themselves shot down over enemy territory. The money might be useful in buying their way out of some situations. The bombers usually left England before daybreak on their missions, with death and destruction flying with them not only for their targets and victims but just possibly for their crews as well, Yes, this was war!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bomber crew 92nd started seeking its targets in July that year. It flew nine successful missions over Germany during the next less than two months. About 4:00 a.m. on 13 Sep. 1944 it started out from England on its tenth mission, which was to be Nuremberg, Germany, the place where trials were later held for Nazis accused of war crimes, The nine members of the crew were in good spirits and anticipating another successful bombing mission, But just short of their target, enemy fire caught <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-953" title="953"></span> them and the plane’s one engine was shot out. Then the Nazis’ big guns found the other engine and that was destroyed also. A signal immediately came from the bomber’s radio to prepare for a crash landing. This signal was easily heard by the crew above the noise of the bomber, since each member wore earphones tuned in for just such purposes. To prepare for a crash landing meant to remove one’s earphones, go to the small radio room and lie down on the floor bracing one’s feet against the walls of the room to lessen the jar of a rough landing - and await the outcome.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the crew of the ill-fated bomber heard the warning signal, four of them complied immediately by removing their earphones and going to the radio room. But George felt there was still a little time left to stay at his gunner’s post and apparently so did four of the others and they were fortunate to be able to hear the change of orders to “bail out”, as fire broke out in the plane and spread rapidly, trapping those in the radio room. It was with difficulty that George made it to a door and, opening it, adjusted his parachute and jumped. The other four started to follow but only the first two of them made it before the whole plane burst into flames. George saw their parachutes open following their jumps but they were later reported to have been straightway killed by the enemy when they came to land near a little German town. Others of the crew must have burned with the bomber, for none of them were ever heard of again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ground fire followed George as his parachute drifted earthward. Intense pain gripped both his legs as some shrapnel found its mark. He felt lucky to land on a smail hill amid some bushes, but when he untangied himself and tried to stand, he could not. His right leg, swollen and bleeding from a jagged gash, was so sore and stiffened he had no use of it. Following earlier well-learned instructions he hurridly dug a hole and buried his parachute so that its presence should not give away his place of hiding. He tried to cover the tracks, then he crawled painfully farther up the hill into the deeper brush, He did what he could for his wounded legs, which was little, keeping a close <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-954" title="954"></span> eye and ear open to the surroundings. He felt sure the foe would hunt for him. By then it was mid-morning and he felt weak from loss of blood and perhaps lack of food. He had not eaten since shortly after midnight. He tried to relax and await the unknown fate which surely would befall him. He thought of home and family - and of his girl friend waiting back in the “valleys of the mountains”. Was there any likely chance he’d live to see any of them again?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was nearing noon of that September day when he heard voices in the distance - gutteral German voices giving out many ejaculations he could not understand. Fear seized him for a moment; people were on his trail! The voices came closer and closer - then he could see human forms through the bushes. The voice of one, sterner and more vehement than the others, seemed to be in charge. George held his breath momentarily and tried not to move a muscle. Suddenly he was poked right in the ribs by a searching cane and he knew his time was up. He crawled painfully out of hiding to face about twenty German soldiers supervised by a German Major.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was immediately made to understand that he must empty his pockets, which he did, placing some things on one side and some on another. The currency in its plastic cover was placed on the side opposite the Major, who failed to see it. It was scooped up right away by one of the soldiers in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way but who later gave the prisoner a hidden wink and smile when he failed to report his “take” to the Major. George felt that he had perhaps made a friend of a sort, and this proved to be so later.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The German soldiers administered first aid to his wounded legs and bandaged the right one which was more sorely afflicted. Then half dragging and carrying their prisoner they placed him into a waiting truck and headed toward town some distance away. Enroute they drove through a large prune orchard, and as George tried to stand with the rest to fill his pockets with the ripened fruit, he was shoved down into the bottom of the truck again. He was very hungry! Soon the “friendly” soldier nudged <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-955" title="955"></span> up to him, however, and slyly slipped him a few prunes from his own pocket. George found that some Germans could be human after all. Other small, inconspicuous favors were given the prisoner by his newly found friend before they were separated.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George eventually found himself in northern Germany at Stalogluft Camp No. 4, about thirty miles from the Baltic Sea. Here some 10,000 prisoners were interned by the Germans, approximately 7,000 Americans and 3,000 English and Australians. There were five compounds with twenty barracks each. Most were Air Force personnel, Commissioned and Non-commissioned officers, George was one of the latter. Russian prisoners of war were forced to wait on these prisoners and do the “dirty work”. George felt he couldn’t complain of the treatment - aside from the food and sanitary conditions which were terrible! He went from 160 to 120 lbs. in weight.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the compound where George was imprisoned someone had an excellent radio which was disassembled in daytimes and reassembled at nights, thus keeping it hidden from the German guards. In this manner they kept track of the progress of the war and knew that its ending was drawing nearer and nearer. They learned that the Russians were gaining ground on Germany’s northern borders and so were not at all surprised when, in February 1945, the prisoners were marched out of Stalagluft Camp No. 4, under heavy guard, and were started marching over Germany in an effort to escape the Russians as they fought their way into the country. For some two months, mostly in the cold of winter, these half starved and weary men were literally herded back and forth over Germany, covering some 600 miles on foot during that period. The first few days of this forced walking the Germans tried to keep the some 10,000 prisoners together but soon found that it was safer and more practical to divide them into smaller units.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finally, the war nearly ended and according to terms of the peace, which making was then in process, the unit of about 1500 American prisoners, in which George found himself, crossed over the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-956" title="956"></span> river Elbe to Halle, Germany and joined the American troops who had fought their way in to that point. There was great rejoicing among the Americans but the German guards who had accompanied them were taken prisoners by the Yankee conquerors. What a thrill it was for George, along with the rest of his fellow comrades, to get cleaned up and receive new clothing and uniforms. His right leg had never healed and had given him quite a bit of trouble, especially on the recent marches. This was soon taken care of by experts. For the first time in more than seven months word was relayed to his loved ones that he was no longer “missing in action” but safe and compratively well. He must have often wondered during those seemingly endless months why he alone, of all his bomber crew, had been allowed to live. And we too ask this question. We do not know the answer. But knowing that with the gift of life comes the responsibility of service, we can only surmise that he yet has greater missions to accomplish and greater services to render.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George and the liberated American prisoners in his group were soon flown to Camp “Lucky Strike” in France and from there, as soon as troop transports became available, were shipped to the good old U.S.A. His ship docked in Virginia, where he took the train to Fort Douglas, Utah. Here he was granted a sixty day furlough. Having been liberated on 26 Apr. 1945, he was able to arrive home the forepart of July. What a homecoming! He was married 10 Aug, 1945 at her hometown Nephi, Utah, to his sweetheart Blanch Yates (b. 6 Oct. 1926 in Nephi to Herbert Moroni and Della Louise Willis Yates). He was going on twenty-one and she was going on nineteen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George was granted a twenty day extension to his furlough so it was not until about the latter part of September that he went back into the service and then he took his new bride with him. They went to Long Beach, California where four large hotels had been taken over by the Air Force. They were treated like kings while here and it cost the service men nothing, except for their wives’ meals, those who brought their wives along. This was indeed a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-957" title="957"></span> royal honeymoon for George and Blanche and it only ended when they were returned to Kearns, Utah to await his discharge, which took place 21 Nov. 1945.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The couple returned to Santaquin, Utah and lived with his parents for about six months while George scouted around for work, which was not too plentiful during that post-war period. Finally he went to work in Provo for a “parts” store and worked for them until 1954, two years in the store and six years as an outside salesman. Then he went to work for Central Utah Motor Company of Provo as manager of parts and service until 1960, when they went out of business. He returned to work for Town Supply Co. again until 1962 when he got a job with Morris Motors where he has remained until the present (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He and Blanche moved down by the LDS Hospital in Provo and bought a home there. Blanche, who had studied beauty culture, has a beauty shop in their home. For recreation George joined a bowling league but greatly enjoys the out-of-doors while camping, fishing or hunting. Blanche often joins him in these activities. She says George takes her on his outdoor trips to “do the cooking” but she enjoys them. They have a daughter and a son. Last fall Blanche went back to Maryland to be present at the birth of their first grandchild.</p>
