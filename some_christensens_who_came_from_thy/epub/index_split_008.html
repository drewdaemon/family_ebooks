  <p class="calibre1">In the eighth century something formidable began to stir in the north countries - the curtain was going up on that dynamic drama, the “Age of <span id="page-13"></span> the Vikings”, Bursting upon the scene almost like spontaneous combustion, raiders in tall-masted “long ships” shoved off from the coasts of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, their aim not so much war as plunder. The concurrent scenes enacted by these barbarians (let’s face it) were backed by no con- certed plan and no strategic political aims. Every- thing just erupted in some overwhelming fashion. “Suddenly the Swedes, in a current of marauding vigor, struck southward through Russian rivers to Constantinople”. Dano-Norwegians sailed from Norway to the Mediterranean and harried the shores of this inland sea. Norwegian buccaneers; in a far-ranging impulse, sailed to Ireland, Iceland, and presently across the Atlantic to Greenland, with Leif Ericksson, son of Eric the Red, and on to the American continent (long before Columbus), which they called “Vinland”, meaning Wineland. Danish Vikings rowed along the coasts and up the rivers of France and England and, leaping ashore without warning, plundered and burned villages, farms, estates and convents, taking off again before word could get around. Like destruc- tive tornadoes these Vikings swept in all directions, bearing terror and death, and none could stay them. “From the rage of the Norsemen deliver us, O Lord” was the prayer that rose up from far and near.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What the word “Viking” really means nobody knows; probably the “men from the fjords”, since Vik in Danish (Vig in Norwegian) means a little fjord. Danes and Norwegians often joined in their raids, it was difficult to distinguish between them. The Viking Age is said to have generally begun with the attack on Lindisfarne, on the northeast coast of England, 8 June 793. “This was by no means the first raid on a French or English coast, but on this occasion the plunderers’ attack was on a famous English convent, Episcopal residence and well known seat of learning. Its holy inmates were killed or dragged off as slaves by these barbarians”. The report sped down through western Europe and everybody was shocked and horrified - but this was only a start! In 835 the Viking storm broke with all its fury; whole fleets, of sometimes 300-400 vessels at a time, launched wholesale attacks, <span id="page-14"></span> taking spoils and prisoners. These Vikings seemed to be completely fearless and without pity, sacri- ficing their prisoners to their Nordic gods or selling them as slaves. War was their chief occu- pation and slaves their chief trade during those convulsive decades.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the most renowned Vikings of all times was Ragnar Lodbrok, or “Hairy Breeches”, born in Norway but a member of the ruling family of Denmark. This hero sailed up the Seine in 845, with 120 ships, ravaging Paris and the country on both sides of the river. The French King Charles, who challenged him, was forced to take refuge in a convent. Charles finally bought him off with 7,000 lbs. of silver (“Danegeld”) and Ragnar sailed home. Next this Viking turned against England’s Northumbria, where he was finally captured by the King there and cast into a snake pit to die amid a coiling mass of loathsome adders. Ragnar had four sons, and as he drew his last breath he muttered this potent threat: “The little pigs would grunt now if they knew how it fares with the old boar”. The old Norse legend tells how his sons received the news: “Ironside gripped his spear shaft so hard that the print of his fingers remained stamped upon it. Hvitserk was playing chess but he clenched his fingers upon his pawn so tightly that the blood started from under his nails. Siguard Snake-eye was trimming his nails with a knife and kept on paring until he cut into the bone; but the fourth son was the one who counted. Ivar-the- Boneless demanded to know the precise details of his father’s death and his face became red, blue and pale by turns and his skin appeared puffed up by anger”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ivar was a warrior of command and guile and he sought bloody revenge. He was the mastermind behind the Scandinavian invasion of England in 866-67. His powerful Danish Sea army brought a near end to the Kingdom of Northumbria and a horrible death to her king; destroying her dwellings, churches, and monasteries with fire and sword and with them masterpieces of Angelican art and the culture of Bede, Alcium and Caedmon. Nothing was left but roofless walls. Northumbria never</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-15"></span> again acquired any sign of her former greatness, But Ivar’s army didn’t stop there - it marched on, taking East Anglia and into Mercia. “The Vikings, with their brightly painted shields and banners, their finery and golden bracelets, made the Saxons seem modest by comparison. As they slowly approached their foes they clashed their shields and weapons and raised long, repeated war cries as their missiles began to fly”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Other Viking armies returned again and again. No one knew when or where they would-strike; the English kings and their armies could not be everywhere at once. Then the Danes began staying. longer each year and soon they brought their families and began taking over the land. During that century the Danish Vikings literally streamed into England, until the whole areas of northern and eastern England and the Midlands became one large Peasant community called “Danelagh”. The raids and the settling kept up until more than a fourth of England’s inhabitants were Danes - or descended from them, The threat to England became deadly Earnest.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Other Vikings went to France and their chiefs became rulers of sizable areas of Flanders. In fact, they were on French coasts every single year and the French king’s only resort was to buy them off with “Danegeld” - but they always returned. In desperation, in 911, the king granted a Danish Chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French), Normandy as a fief on condition that he would protect France from other Viking invasions. He promised but took it lightly and Danes continued to raid and settle as he did. Rolf retained Normandy and his grandson became the Duke of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror, who crossed the channel and took over England in 1066.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The real soul of the Vikings lay in the,“long ships”, The Scandinavian peoples had succeeded in creating a craft that for its day was undoubtedly the finest in Europe. Every detail was the result of thousands of years spent on the sea. Models of Such ships have been dug up almost intact, the most famous in Gokstad, Norway in 1880. “It is 76 ft. 6 inches from stem to stern; 17 ft. 9 inches <span id="page-16"></span> amidship; clinker built of solid oak planks fastened with tree-nails and iron bolts and caulked with cord of plaited animal hair; with sixteen oars per side, varying in length between 17 and 19 ft. and beautifully shaped with the mast 40 ft. high. It could carry a smaller boat or ‘dinghy’, a crew of fifty, and if necessary another thirty warriors or captives, in all weathers, and could ride out the fiercest storms of the Atlantic Ocean. Such were the vessels which in many different sizes bore the Vikings to the plunder of the civilized world, to the assault of Constantinople, the siege of Paris, the foundation of Dublin, Ireland, as well as many parts of England and the discovery of America”. Their pictures rise before us vivid and bright: their finely carved dragon-shaped prows; their high curving sterns; their long rows of shields, black and yellow, alternately ranging along their sides - the gleam of steel, the scent of murder. Yet these super instruments of sea power would have been useless without the men who handled them; all were volunteer leaders of marked ability and as good at the helms or oars as they were with their swords. We are told that men between 16-60 were chosen but none without atrial of ability and strength.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And then one came who was able to halt the on-rushing might of these overwhelming Danish Vikings, or at least to temper it. Had it not been so all England would have been put under the yoke of these plundering settlers. That one was Alfred, a Saxon king called “The Great”, partly because of his ability to challenge these warriors and sometimes win. All through the years of his reign King Alfred’s armies and those of the Danish Vikings waged deadly war, with little to show on either side much of the time but scars and corpses. Though it was more than a century after his death before the Age of the Vikings came to a close, yet he showed that they could be stopped and pointed the way whereby his descendants took up the successful challenge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sir Winston Churchill, in his chapter on the Vikings, found in his “History of the English Speaking Peoples” (Vol. 1) - from which much of this <span id="page-17"></span> material on the Vikings has been gleaned - writes: “When we reflect upon the brutal vices of these saltwater bandits, pirates as shameful as any whom the sea has borne, or recoil from their villainous destruction and cruel deeds, we must also remember the discipline, the fortitude, the comradeship and martial virtues which made them, at this period, beyond all challenge, the most formidable and daring race in the world… From Yorkshire to Norfolk this sturdy, upstanding stock took root and thus the bloodstream of these vigor- ous individualists, proud and successful men of the sword, mingled henceforward in the English race, a vivifying, potent, lasting and resurgent quality”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is no denying the terror let loose by the Vikings in western Europe and elsewhere. Thousands of people were killed or forced into slavery. Thousands of widows all over Europe had reason to curse the Vikings of Scandinavia. But naturally these bloodthirsty expeditions claimed thousands of Danish lives too, either slain or drowned; and despite the fact that these dead had nobody to blame but themselves, the events as seen from Denmark’s side on the homefront were often dismal enough. And there were widows in Denmark too, standing along the beaches every autumn, staring vainly out to sea as ships returned home - or did not return. Many tombstones were raised in Denmark for Danes who never returned with their ships. Kipling caught the picture in his “Harp Song of the Dane Women”:</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">“What is a woman that you forsake her and the hearth-fire and the home-acre to go with the old grey widow-maker?”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark’s adventure of a thousand years ago may appear as a brief, confused episode to the descendants of that country called the British Isles; peopled by ancient Britons, invaded by Celts, then conquered and occupied by the Romans for 400 years, then invaded and conquered by Angles and Saxons, then by Danish Vikings, and finally by Norman Knights under William the Conqueror, their origin is so tangled that they can scarcely be blamed if they are not excited <span id="page-18"></span> about where they came from and how. Yet on the other hand, Danes and their descendants represent one of the few peoples in Europe that have never suffered from large-scale invasions or population transfers. They can really claim, for the most part, to be descendants of the Danes of the Stone Age. They can point with pride to the ancient Vikings, knowing full well that generation after generation their Danish ancestors have called Jutland and her islands home! They know they are of the blood of Vikings and that the romantic days of the “long ships” were perhaps among their progenitors’ brightest. Perhaps Danes dream of their great - grandsires “Anders the Ploughman” and “Christian Red Whiskers” standing at the prows of high masted ships or rowing at them, streaking toward Normandy or the British Isles. Or do they think of their many, many great-grandmothers, “Karen Lauritzdatter” and “Maren Christiansdatter” standing on Jutland’s beaches as days begin to chill, gazing out hopefully for signs of sails? Cannot we too meditate and dream of these, since we are of the blood of Vikings? Is it not necessary to know who one really is?</p>
