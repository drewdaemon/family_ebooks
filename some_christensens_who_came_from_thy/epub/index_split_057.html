  <h2 class="calibre9" id="virginia-christensen">Virginia Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(ll) Virginia Christensen (4) It is recorded that I was born 6 Sept. 1901 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the day United States President William McKinley was assassinated. Aunt Elsie Bartholomew often told me what a scrawny, homely baby I was and how sorry Father felt for Mother, her having gone through so much for such a poor specimen, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-703" title="703"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">When I was a small girl Mother often told me about the visit of a wandering gypsy to our home while I was yet a babe. When she proudly showed her first-born off to the visitor, the old woman offered to tell my fortune, and the words she said were - “When they’re pretty when they’re little they’ll be ugly when they’re big and vice versa - this child will be a beautiful woman!” Whether this pronouncement ever really took place or not I have no way of knowing, yet I believed the story then with all my heart and it remained in my memory and helped to buoy me up during my ugly duckling years. As a woman, however, my mirror has never reflected “a beauty” and I have had to be satisfied with the thought that “beauty is as beauty does”. Some have said that I resemble my Danish grandmother Else in looks, though not in stature. Be that as it may I was not fortunate enough to inherit lovely auburn tresses like hers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When I reflect on my childhood I remember it as being a wonderful time of learning, achieving, and being appreciated and loved. Our big new house into which we moved when I was nine was the envy of my friends. My sister Elaine and I were also envied by them because of the time our talented mother took with us in teaching us singing, dramatics and such, and because of the numerous opportunities we had to “show off” because of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How I loved school! I could hardly wait for each autumn when the school bell started ringing. I attended school at Manti from “Beginners Grade” into High School - from the red brick schoolhouse to the white brick schoolhouse on the same block. The day before my eighth grade graduation I sprained my right thumb playing volleyball at school and was forced to attend the graduation exercises with my black-and-blue thumb all bandaged up. The hurt to my pride was worse than the hurt to my digit, and needless to say I accepted my diploma with my left hand. A little over a year after that graduation my darling mother passed away and childhood for me came to an end too. Life seemed much more serious after that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following my two years at Manti High, Father <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-704" title="704"></span> sent Elaine and me to attend B. Y. High at Provo. He found a nice elderly couple there, the Oscar Hydes, with whom we could room and board, and instructed them to treat us like their own daughters. This they faithfully tried to do and threw in plenty of advice in the bargain. But when they started calling us and our dates in for family prayers at nine o’clock in the evenings, indicating that it was time for us to retire, it was a little hard to take.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father’s last words as he left us that autumn at the Hydes’ in Provo had been, “Virginia, you are the oldest and I shall hold you responsible not only for your own conduct but for Elaine’s as well.” Now at that time I was a worrier and dear fun-loving sister Elaine took advantage of her new found freedom, which managed to keep me pretty worried. She had a gay time trying her wings while I hardly dared venture beyond Hydes and school. She became well acquainted with most everyone while I walked my prim little way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This was the winter of the great influenza epidemic in Utah (1918/19) and Provo was not spared. Prof. Clair Reid, our music teacher, had Elaine and me join with six others of his vocal students to form a double mixed quartet and sing at funeral after funeral in the Provo cemetery, no inside services being allowed then. We stood on planks thrown over the muddy, snowy ground and blended our voices in the hymns while Prof. Reid pumped away at an old organ, which stood in a small truck beside us, and played our accompaniment. One short funeral service followed another and we moved around from place to place as coffin after coffin was lowered into the frozen earth and sobbing mourners stood around. So many died that winter. Day after day we sang and shivered and were awed by the sadness of it all. Neither Elaine nor I took the flu that year, although others of our roommates at Hydes came down with it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The following winter when we returned to Provo to school, some of Elaine’s many friends said, “We see you have brought your younger sister with you this year.” Indeed! Though I was smaller of course I was older and more advanced in school and had also been there the year before. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-705" title="705"></span> I was determined to worry less and have more fun that year and it proved to be a challenging, wonderful one for me, both educationally and socially. I was chosen to serve as High School Studentbody vice-president. I took part in several plays under the new college dramatic coach, Dr. T. Earl Pardoe. I sang in choruses, vocal ensembles, and did some soprano solo work. I also met a young man for the first time, by the name of Daniel Keeler, although we had been students together the year before. His home was just a block from the Hydes where I lived again that year. We began dating.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I graduated from B.Y. High the spring of 1920, while Elaine took the college preparatory course of three years high school only, so that we could enter as freshmen together at the University the next fall, which we did. That too was a wonderful school year for me. I was elected vice-president of the freshman class. Elaine and I took private vocal from the new voice teacher, Prof. Florence Jepperson (later Dr. Florence J. Madsen). Again I took part in dramas, choruses, etc., and had a lead in the college opera. I was a member of the ladies trio that was chosen to represent BYU at the Utah State Fair that year. Elaine and I began singing duets together and with Prof. Jepperson as our coach and often our accompanist and we were soon in much demand for school, church and community functions. For the third straight year we lived at Oscar and Stella Hydes’. Again I dated Daniel Keeler, star basketball and football player and trackman.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Second year college was also great and again dramatic and musical activities took much of my time and attention. I was also assistant editor of the college literary magazine that year. Elaine and I, together with five of our very special girl friends, organized one of the first, if not the first, social clubs at BYU. At first we called ourselves the “Seven Sisters” which was later changed to the more sophisticated O. S. Trovata. I was active in Mask Club and for this group presented a dramatic reading of the three-act play “Merely Mary Ann”. One of the most exciting experiences of that year, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-706" title="706"></span> however, was when I returned to my hometown of Manti and sang as guest lead in the high school operetta “Chimes of Normandy” under the direction of one of my early music teachers, Ellis E. Johnson, who was a pillar of musical strength in Manti for nearly half a century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Summers at home in Manti were busy times. There was always plenty of work to do even after Father married “Aunt Myrtle” in June 1920 and brought her home to mother us. I had many friends and “our crowd” had lots of good times together. Among other summer activities I usually took piano lessons from Prof. Lavoir Jensen but my fingers were too short to really achieve in that field.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most of the summer of 1922 I spent at Starr Ranch keeping house for the farm hands in the “south home”. Among the group who had to put up with my cooking were my brother Sherman, Uncle Joe Snow, and the foreman of the ranch, Mr. Christopherson, whose wife had gone away to have a baby. My friend, Daniel Keeler, was in Canada that summer and I corresponded with him. Each afternoon I saddled a horse and rode a mile or so to the little village of Mona to mail the letters I had written and pick up any there for me. I often bought crochet thread at the one small joint store and post office that place afforded. I spent the evenings working on my trousseau, for by then I was contemplating marriage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Back to Provo and B. Y. U. that September I was plunged headlong into my busiest school year ever. I was nominated as a candidate for Studentbody vice-president. The campaign was a hot one and I lost to Alice Ludlow, now the wife of present president of B. Y. U., Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson. My disappointment was soon smothered in a maze of other activities. The very day of the election I got word that my essay had been chosen as one of the best in the Heber J. Grant oratorical contest preliminaries. I later gave my paper, “Obedience to Law”, as an oration in the contest and won first place, for which I received an autographed book and congratulations from the President of the church, Heber J. Grant. It was only the second year for the Grant oratorical contest which is still <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-707" title="707"></span> held yearly at B. Y. U.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I took my “teacher training” teaching a college class in harmony, since I planned to graduate at the end of two terms of summer school the following summer. I had kept my grades high and taken the maximum load, in spite of all the extracurricular activities in which I had engaged. These extra activities continued throughout that school year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Daniel M. Keeler, most always called “Dan”, came down to Manti on Christmas Eve and gave me a diamond. We were married during the holidays, 3 Jan. 1923, in the Salt Lake Temple. We had no reception - this was a difficult time financially for Father and Aunt Myrtle who, bless their hearts, did the best for us they could. Father gave me $100.00 and Aunt Myrtle gave us three or four new pieced quilts she had just made for the family, and sewed lingerie for me during the holidays, working night and day at it although she was expecting her second child. My “hope chest” was the old family trunk that had been my mother’s and which I still have as a “costume trunk”. My Uncle Warren and Kate Snow of Salt Lake City gave us a wedding supper at their home and we stayed at the Hotel Utah overnight for our honeymoon, returning to Provo the next evening and school the following Monday morning as Mr. and Mrs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The extra activities continued as before. One of the most enjoyable activities of my college career was taking a lead in Victor Herbert’s comic opera “The Red Mill”, May 14, 1923. My husband Dan also took a comic lead in that production, which was mostly a dramatic part in which he could “fake” the singing. I continued on to summer school for the first term of six weeks but was forced to drop out for the second term with only a few more credit hours to go towards my graduation. Elaine dropped out for the following winter and taught in Manti, in hopes that we could both return to college after my baby (Daniel) was born and graduate together. But it was twenty-one years before I returned to B.Y.U. as a student.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the interim Dan was forced to quit school and go to work, and we moved to Carbon county, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-708" title="708"></span> Utah, living first in Price where he sold cars for his brother-in-law’s agency; then in Helper where he operated a service station, and finally to the mining camp of Latuda where he eventually went into the coal mine there. It was by then the time of the great depression and jobs were scarce. Our second child, Jennie, was born in my folks’ lovely home in Manti just a short time before they turned it over to their creditors and moved to Provo and later Orem. Our third child, Colleen, was born in Helper. Our fourth child, Ellen, was born at my folks’ home in Orem, and our fifth child, Phillip, was born in Standardville, Utah, our first hospital-born baby.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Church activity and service were important to us. I taught in the Primary in Price. In Helper I was a Relief Society visiting teacher for the first and only time and then was called to be president of the Primary. One of the interesting experiences during this service was the Primary operetta “Rose Dream” we put on in a local theatre in connection with the picture show. I directed and staged this production, my first counselor took charge of costumes and scenery, and my second counselor accompanied on the piano. The operetta was given to a packed house just ten days before our daughter Colleen was born.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Latuda we attended Standardville Branch a mile or so away - walking to and fro most of the time. In Relief Society I served in almost every capacity except that of president, also directing a number of special activities, including a “kitchenette band” to raise money for our Relief Society library project. I put on one-act plays. I taught a class in Sunday School. My most satisfying church service there, however, was being president of the Y. L. M. I. A. for more than three years. I also directed the music and drama most of the time, since we seldom could find anyone else who would do it in that very small branch. During this time the ladies’ chorus which I organized and directed won the Stake contest, the District,and was chosen to go to Salt Lake City to participate in the All Church Chorus in the Tabernacle for M. I. A. June conference, where it sang under <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-709" title="709"></span> the direction of the guest conductor Noble Cain, nationally known composer and musician.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ours was rather an odd looking chorus made up of both young singers and some who were older. There were two old maid school teachers from Nebraska who were Methodists, a tall thin one and a short plump one, and a very young new convert straight from England among the fourteen singers we had mustered. This young convert said to me once, walking home from practice, “Can one be baptized over again? You know there is hardly anything I haven’t tried!” Our accompanist was the wife of the Principal of Latuda Junior High and she was a good one. Our winning number was “O Divine Redeemer”. All my efforts, prayers and spent time were more than rewarded when Brother Robinson of the M. I. A. General Board stood up in the Tabernacle at one of the general conference meetings to evaluate the M. I. A. arts program and said, among other things, “Out of the smoke, dust, grime and desolation of a coal camp has come one of the most divine ladies choruses I have ever heard!” I knew he meant our chorus and my eyes filled with tears as I trembled with emotion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was while living in Latuda that I first became seriously interested in genealogy, encouraged by my husband’s lovely parents, Joseph B. and Martha Alice Fairbanks Keeler, who were both experienced genealogists. I began to search the records for my progenitors, going occasionally to the Genealogical Library in Salt Lake City, then a rather humble institution in comparison with today’s world-famous organization. Dan and I both served on the Branch and then the Stake genealogical committees. Then he was called to serve as a counselor in the Branch presidency and later as Standardville Branch President, serving as such for a number of years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I taught vocal music in the Latuda Junior High School one year and was “drafted” to teach the same at Carbon High School and Carbon Junior College in Price the spring quarter of 1942, when their music instructor, Ferris Edgley, was drafted into the service. I rode back and forth on the school <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-710" title="710"></span> bus, leaving Ellen and Phillip in the care of some close neighbors and distant relatives, the Moffitts. Colleen was in Jr. High at Helper and Dan and Jennie attending Carbon High School, so they rode the bus with me. Our son Dan graduated that spring. I prepared the music for the Baccalaureate and Commencement services - it was a real challenge. A few years before I had been invited to join a Price community ladies chorus which twice each year joined the city’s male chorus in a public concert. I was one of the leading soloists in their presentation of Handel’s Messiah at Christmastime two different years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Being concerned with the cultural disadvantages of raising our children in a mining camp we did all we could to combat this. Colleen took violin lessons, Jennie studied the cello and Dan Jr. the bass fiddle, as well as the mellaphone. We organized a string quartet for a short time, with me playing the piano. We had a family chorus but lacked a tenor. Jennie and two of her little friends were organized into a girls trio which we called “The Three Little Maids.” They sang often at school and church. They won first place in the Elks talent contest in Price one year and Colleen won second on her violin. I accompanied both. We sought the outstanding musical program on our radio. The children especially enjoyed the “All Girl Orchestra.” Dan Jr. was in both the Jr. High and High School bands. We encouraged him and attended all his programs. We sang at our work around the house, in unison or harmony. I can recommend singing together as a bridge to the “generation gap” in the family. We seldom had disciplinary problems with our children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the spring of 1943 we moved back to Provo. There were few houses for sale in the vicinity of B.Y.U. where we wished to settle, at a price that we could afford. We finally found an old two-story one at 362 North 400 East. We bought it and moved in on election day in Nov. 1944. We have been remodeling and fixing it up ever since and are still at it. Dan has done so much work on it, carrying out many of my ideas for beauty and his for comfort. We have always worked well together <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-711" title="711"></span> as a team. One of the children once said, “There is hardly anything that Mother can’t ‘make up’ or Daddy can’t ‘make’”, referring at the time to an M.I.A. roadshow I had concocted that needed as a backdrop a giant rising moon in action. Dan made the moon and it was so realistic that old Ward members still talk about it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As soon as we were comfortably settled in Provo I went back to college at B.Y.U. Both campuses were within easy walking distance of our home. The requirements for graduation had increased since I was a student there twenty-one years before - the classes were “stiffer”. I changed my major from drama to music and took as many classes each quarter for the next year, including summer, to secure enough credits for graduation. The graduation committee voted in my favor and I understood later that the members had included the excellent singing of my older daughters whom I had trained as one of my musical assets. I graduated in June 1945 with honors. It was a dream come true!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our church service did not diminish in Provo, Dan became a counselor in the Ward Sunday School Superintendency, a member of the Stake Seventies Quorum Presidency for many years, and finally President of the High Priests group in the Ward. I served on the Relief Society Stake Board as chorister and directed the Stake “Singing Mothers”. I assisted with and sang in the Relief Society Singing Mothers Centennial Chorus that presented a concert in the Salt Lake Tabernacle in 1947 under the direction of Florence J. Madsen. I directed choruses, plays and roadshows for the ward M.I.A. and served as Y.L.M.I.A. president, first in the Fifth Ward, Provo Stake and then, when that Ward was divided, in the Eighth Ward of East Provo Stake for well over three years, or until my health broke. I then served as editor of the Eighth Ward paper for a year-and-a-half.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime, besides engaging in some club and civic work, I trained and accompanied our two daughters, Jennie and Colleen, in vocal duet work and they became much in demand for programs, not only locally but throughout the county. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-712" title="712"></span> I organized and directed a group of seven of our youngest daughter Ellen’s little friends in a singing group we named “The Singing Sallies”. They too were called upon to sing at church, school and community functions without number. These were only a very few of the activities, both musical and otherwise, engaged in by members of our family. Indeed we were a busy family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dan worked for Geneva Steel near Provo for well over twenty years. He was active in politics and served as Republican district chairman for sixteen years and as a delegate to the State Republican Convention every election year during that period. He has always been a great sports fan and has followed the activities of the B. Y. U. football and basketball teams with enthusiasm over these past twenty-five years. He loves to garden and raises lovely flowers, potting his numerous geranium plants each winter in a make-shift nursery in the basement. Together we raise beautiful house plants, including African violets. Dan loves to travel and he has taken numerous trips with our eldest son, Dan, into the southern and eastern “wonderlands” of Utah on filming excursions for educational TV, in which the younger Dan is engaged. The older Dan and I have driven by car to visit our married children in New York, New Jersey, California and Arizona. We recently flew for a two weeks visit to a daughter’s family in Cleveland, Ohio and visited early church points of interest while there. In these later years I have sometimes longed to travel to distant lands, especially Denmark, should my health permit. But so far I have had to be content mostly with being an “arm chair traveler,” where that is concerned,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since retiring two years ago from Geneva Steel Dan has been serving as Eighth Ward clerk, from which position he has recently been released. Presently the two of us are working hard together on both of our genealogies with some success. He goes often to the Salt Lake Temple and Genealogical Society. He has had excellent health over the years with the exception of a heart attack which he suffered five years ago and from which he has made remarkable recovery. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-713" title="713"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the other hand my physical health has been rather poor for the past dozen years as I suffer from rhumatoid arthritis. Severe surgery for cancer eight years ago brought me to the realization that I might not have too many more years to live; that I still had important work to do and should be getting at it in dead earnest! But just what was the most important work for me to engage in during my “bonus” years? Genealogy was my first answer. Then recalling a blessing I had been given a few weeks after my marriage by my husband’s father, who was then Patriarch of Provo Stake, I began to puzzle over these statements in it: “You have many gifts of the spirit and natural endowments…. You have the gift and power of language - the ability to express your thoughts by word of mouth and by writing. Cultivate this gift and God will bless you, for your words will fly as on the wings of morning to the delight and benefit of many people; thus returning to you after many days like bread cast upon the waters.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I had never thought of myself as being much of a writer since my freshman English class in composition at B.Y.U., where Elaine got straight A’s and I was lucky to come off with C’s; the only C’s I ever received in college as I recall. I had always considered Mother, Elaine and Sherman as the writers of our particular Christensen family - and still do. Yet here in this blessing was an indication that I could write and should improve the talent. Why not combine genealogy and writing?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1962 I published a history and genealogy of some of my mother’s people, the Van Burens. I did it as a missionary project to try and have a hand in turning the hearts of my dear relatives towards their fathers. It was not planned to be a financial success - and was not. But, like bread cast upon the waters, much joy and satisfaction has come to me through this endeavor - and the end is not yet in sight. I had long had a desire to write my Grandmother Christensen’s history so I turned to that. My Christensen book will be the result. Already the happiness I have gained through the interest, kindnesses and willing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-714" title="714"></span>assistance of my many wonderful Christensen cousins and their descendants in this project has made it more than worth while. I feel that the descendants of Laurs and Else K. Christensen have grown closer together in spirit and understanding. What more could I ask? I couldn’t have done either of these books without the unselfish help of my fine husband - he has gone along with me every step of the way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dan and I continue to find happiness and satisfaction in the programs of the church. We marvel at its growth and fulfillment of prophecy. The Gospel of the Master is still our guide and inspiration. Yet abundant joy comes to us from association with our five outstanding children and twenty-six lovely grandchildren and we cannot help but feel that they are perhaps our greatest assets in this life. We have complete confidence that these cherished family relationships will continue beyond mortality and will weather all else that may stand between earth life and the eternities - forever. How else could there be Heaven there for us?</p>
