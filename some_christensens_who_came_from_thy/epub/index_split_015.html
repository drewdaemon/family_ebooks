  <h2 class="calibre9" id="bested-1862-1865">BESTED … 1862-1865</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">It so happened that the late autumn of 1862 found Else enrolling in the Folk High School at Bested (sometimes written as Bedsted), one of the larger places in Thisted Amt, though not a big one as cities go. Though it was only four or so miles due south of Nørhaa, across Ovesø and down, one had to travel there around the lake some twelve miles east past Snedstrup, then turning south at Stagstrup on southwest past several small farm villages to the town of Hassing, and from there still a bit farther west, Anders took her in the wagon, for she had so many things, and gave her the fee for her registration. She was to live at the school with the other students and assist in the cooking, cleaning, or anything else required of her, for this was the custom then at those schools. Though she hoped to spend Yule vacation at home, there were tears when Else bid her father goodbye - how she would miss him! She had brought along her little identification book with the official seal upon it; ‘twas the first time she had found occasion to use it since receiving it soon after her confirmation. She was really an adult now, away on her own at boarding school in a city of some size, with her very own roommates. But afterall she was soon sixteen - many Danish girls were married by that age.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Folk High Schools of Denmark had been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-89" title="89"></span> first organized the year 1844 by the Lutheran Bishop N.F.S. Grundtvig, spiritual revivalist of the Danish people. There were only a few of these schools to begin with but their popularity had grown until they were becoming nation-wide. (Later on practically all young people in the rural areas, who could afford it, attended for additional post-school education, and these old high schools are still in existence in Denmark and have recently enjoyed a revival of their popularity all over the Kingdom.) This movement brought about a tremendous, enthusiastic elevation of the intellectual standards, even in Else’s time. There were still few enough of these schools in the year 1862, and fewer still, in far northern Jutland. The city of Bested was fortunate to have one. Here Else found gay young women learning to spin, weave and sew; others simply improving their general knowledge; and still others, like herself, hoping to specialize in education, literature, history, etc., in order to qualify as teachers in the various Parish schools. Young men too, and even older ones, were there learning more of practical farming and, when farm work was slack, they too studied literature, biography, etc. So here in Bested was one of these peasant “schools of life”, and Else Kathrine Andersen was one of the fortunate ones to be learning there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But she could scarcely wait for the Christmas vacation. Never had she been so long away from those she loved. The day before Christmas Eve, since the weather was mild for winter, Far came to bring her home for the celebrations. “What are we having for the Yule feast - roast goose?” There were so many questions to be asked and answered on both sides as father and daughter rode along towards Nørhaa. Did Karen have a suitor yet? “Nej.” “Was Stine looking well to her studies for her confirmation next spring?” “Ja,”—but she has been sick and missed some.” Then it was Anders’ turn for the questions. “Have you seen ought of those ‘Mormon Dippers’ there in Bested?” (This was something that had been worrying him.) “Nej.” But Else had heard from her roommates that some were holding meetings near by. Then Far changed the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-90" title="90"></span> subject: “Are there nice young men at the High School then?” “Ja, ja,” she said, blushing some, “But for these I have no concern!” Her father clucked his tongue and shook his head. “Nej, nej, are our daughters now to be all spinsters?” Then he smiled from the corner of his eye and winked at her,“There’s plenty time yet”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Welcome, welcome” was Mette’s greeting as she hugged her second daughter to her, There was such excitement at her homecoming! What a warm, friendly, merry household was here. This turned out to be the gayest Yuletide of all. The girls could scarcely get through one mess of dishes and turn around till another group of company came. Many relatives and all Else’s old friends called in, seeming happy to bid her welcome home again, if only for Yule. She was a favorite with young and old for she was not as shy as the generous, warmhearted Karen or yet as the sweet, courageous Stine, Little Marie was more outgoing and conversant, like her, but somewhat flighty. Else’s happiest hours of all were the quieter ones, there with her family all about her. How she loved them! One had to get away Sometimes to view ones blessings in a clearer light. Surely she had lived as rich a youth as was granted only a few!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">As Else listened to the preaching of the famous Bishop Grundtvig, when he came to talk to them there at the school in Bested that mid-winter, her blood was stirred with an urgency to achieve, He talked of faith but said that work too was important. Danish youths must improve their minds and skills if they were to save the future of Denmark. Praying was important and necessary, but not enough. Other lecturers came to the school occasionally and sometimes the older male students stood up and told of their experiences. The Pastor or Priest of the Parish church there at Bested was often there to preach. One time he chided the younger students for not attending the services in the church and urged them to attend, lest their souls should be lost. Else was guilty, as were most of the others; the services were so dull it was scarcely worth their time to go. There were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-91" title="91"></span> many Danes, even old ones, who never stepped inside the churches except for special occasions such as baptisms, weddings, funerals and burials, and of course, confirmations. Since the new constitution some twelve years before, baptism in the Lutheran church was no longer compulsory - but children must be washed of their sins before death! To be legally married one had to go to the Priest and one couldn’t dream of having his loved ones buried elsewhere than in the churchyard. All Danish boys and girls, wanted to be confirmed, this too was important; yes, these things most Danes attended to, otherwise they let the church just stand ther. (In Denmark, even at the present time, the average attendance at the Lutheran Church is less than 2% of its membership; yet 90% of the people come to obtain their confirma- tions.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One morning, a few Sabbaths after the Priest’s scolding, Else and some of her roommates attended the meeting at his church. There were a number of the other young students there also, for the Priest’s talk had roused them. Now this “holy man” took good advantage of his young, captive audience that morning to unleash a torrential, verbal blast against the intrusion of some of the “devil’s advocates” into their peaceful Parish. He urged his listeners to “go forward, armed with righteousness and break up the gatherings of these vile blasphemers who dared to call themselves ‘Saints’. Drive them from our midst and let these ‘godless Mormons’ know that there is no place for them here among Christians!” Then the Priest read from a recent København newspaper what the press there had to say of them and it was bad indeed. Else thought she had never heard such rantings and goings-on from any pulpit before, even against the “evil one” himself. A group of young men gathered around the Priest afterwards, but Else and her friends hurried back to the high school, talking excitedly together. One of the older girls whom they respected put in a good word for the accused Mormons; saying these had every right to worship as they chose, the new constitution guaranteed them that. Though public meetings had been banned for them in some places <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-92" title="92"></span> heretofore, it was not so in Bested; the Mormons had bothered few here. It was no longer American preachers only who led these people, for many good Danes were now among them. Else had seen some of these and they were not evil looking or speaking, but fine appearing, upright young men. Besides, one could not always believe what the Priests said for they could not agree but fought among themselves as to what was right or what was wrong to preach. The older girl begged the others to say naught, at school or elsewhere, of her remarks and swore them to secrecy - there was no need to stir things up. But there was plenty of talk at the school the next day about “those Mormons” regardless. It seemed that some rough fellows had broken into their meeting place there on the outskirts of Bested the night before and attacked their two preachers. These were mocked and beaten and their coats torn from their backs. It was a good thing that the police finally came to stop it or all the congregation of them would have gotten the same treatment; ‘twas doubtful that any Mormon trash would ever come back there to pray and preach. Some of the attacking mob had been jailed overnight and then released, but others got away. It was suspicioned that some of the latter might have been young students from the High School and there was talk of an investigation, but no one thought in the least that there would be one, nor was there. “Indeed?” Else looked at the young men she had seen with the Priest at the church last morning and held her tongue, but her thoughts said it for her, “Is this then so Christian?”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Winter slid into spring, then all the north came blooming into summer and Else had good news when she returned home then. They were pleased with her at the school and said if she would return there the following winter term they would be happy to recommend her to the children’s school in Bested for a position the following year. Far and Mor were well pleased at the word and proud too. They had many fine dreams they had dreamed for their children. But too, Else had some things perplexing her in her heart, of which she dared not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-93" title="93"></span> speak. But these were soon mostly forgotten in the joy of being home again with her beloved family. All were there this summer except Christen, who had gone in the army. He was a roamer anyway and seldom at Nørhaa of late, for he had taken up with rough men. Karen was still working in the embroidery shop there and Stine was fully confirmed now, though she was not at all well. She had an asthmatic condition but was better some in summers and so courageous and patient withal. Northwest Jutland was bad for asthma sufferers and there were plenty of them there. Mads, eighteen now, might have to go in the army too, if there was any unrest in the country; but now he was helping Far on the farm and with the cattle, and things had gone well with those. Marie, bless her heart, would soon have her eleventh festival, they would all celebrate it with her; she was the only summer-born member of the entire family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else rode with her father again and there was talk over the fences of “those awful Mormons - thousands of them there were now in the country”; but there was greater talk of Holstein and Slesvig this summer in Nørhaa. Everyone was sick of that question - it was time the government did something about it! She discussed this problem with her father but of the things that trembled hardest on her lips she dared not speak. She sat near her mother, as Mette fetched the butter churn from the closet and then bore in some pans of milk and skimmed them, and while she churned they talked of many things, did other tasks like spinning or weaving or sewing carpet rags. There was always something to put ones hands to. She too could do these things now and cook well too and help with the milking; but for fine sewing she cared little. Mette did most of the talking and gave much advice, when they were together; Else wished she could speak to her of what was in her heart. She walked and talked and sat and sang with her sisters and Mads, and they even practiced dancing together, like they did at the school, and gymnastics. Would they ever be so carefree again? And so the summer flew away and it was harvest time and the threshers came; they no longer had to thresh their grain with flails in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-94" title="94"></span> barn, as before, but they still gathered the fresh straw for bed tickings and to place under the newly woven carpet, Soon it was time to leave for school again and Else had not yet opened her heart fully to anyone at home.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The constant headache was the Slesvig question. The German Confederation (of which Holstein was a member) was constantly interfering with Denmark’s relationship with her two southern provinces, Slesvig and Holstein, This problem had been supposedly settled more than ten years before, by international treaty, but the Germans wouldn’t let things alone and kept trying to draw Slesvig into the Confederation too, in order to take both the provinces away from Denmark’s rule eventually. There was constant trouble down there and finally the Danish government’s patience was exhausted. It was decided to settle the question once and for all, radically, by incorporating Slesvig definitely into Denmark as a State instead of a Province. This was a dangerous step, for it meant that Denmark would be breaking the peace treaty that had been honored for some more than 400 years, since the time the Danish King, Christian I, proclaimed that Slesvig and Holstein should be “forever undivided”. Naturally the government realized this situation was a serious one but, in spite of it, an act to this effect was passed by the Danish parliament Friday evening 13 Nov. 1863. It needed only the King’s signature to make it into law. Two days later, Sunday 15 Nov., King Frederick VII died at Glucksburg Castle, before having had time to sign the act.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Everyone realized the situation was acute and there was talk in every city and village. “When the news reached København by telegram on Sunday evening, all theatres stopped their performances, guns on the coastal fortresses thundered out a mourning salute for the last King of the old Royal House, and tens of thousands of people filled the streets leading in towards Christianborg Palace, where the Prime Minister, Hall, with the traditional cry of,“The King is dead, long live the King !” proclaimed Prince <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-95" title="95"></span> Christian of Glucksburg, Christian IX, King of Denmark”; according to the provisions for the succession agreed upon by international treaty at London, England 8 May 1852. The new King was faced with the immediate problem and it took him three days to decide to sign this act, known as the “November Constitution”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But there was no dilly-dallying down in Germany; here the effect was immediate and Denmark was presented with a carefully calculated ultimatum right away demanding that the new act be repealed. Opinions in the country were sharply divided; the government resigned in anger and a mew one was formed, The regular Danish army, stationed in Holstein, was withdrawn from there back to the southern border of Slesvig, to demonstrate that Denmark had no intention of retaining Holstein any longer - Germany could have the trouble maker! But the act was not repealed and the Danes’ army took upits position at Danevirke, the 1,000 year old border defense embankment on Slesvig’s south border. The troops were requested to hold this position until spring. Danes usually only fought in summers and had no idea there would be much doing before that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Preparedness simply wasn’t one of the Danes’ strong points, especially where war was concerned. One sometimes had the feeling that the Danish outlook had never developed beyond the idea that, in time of war, one took his rusty battle axe down from the wall or went to try and find it in the woodshed where it had been serving a useful purpose, and sharpened it on a grindstone. It was difficult to make these people realize, in peacetime, that newer forms of war required materials and preparations which could not be produced when the enemy suddenly appeared in your paddock. The Danes were too tied up with everyday life and too busy enjoying it, and blessed with too great a sense of humor to be eternally on guard,</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Christmas that year in Nørhaa was hardly noticed by the majority, except that people met in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-96" title="96"></span> the church on Holy days and sang hymns about the “Fatherland” under silent bells, and prayed for peace and the safety of their soldiers. So many of the young men from the town and surrounding villages were in the army now for it had been built up, in case. Christen was down at Danevirke. Mads wanted to go, but Mor clung on to him and wept; he was not the age yet until spring; perhaps there would be no war or it would be over before then and he would “draw a pass”. But Mette was not all tears; in truth she was rather excited about a family of old acquaintances of hers who had recently moved to Nørhaa. A good family, of the better class, trades-people and of the nobility too, way back — besides, they had a marriageable son! He was a little older and well-traveled, and had not long since returned from København. (Mor had it from the neighbors that he was “looking” and would fain have himself a wife from Nørhaa. She was anxious that he should meet her daughters and had invited his family to tea at mid-Yule.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else would have spared herself and gone elsewhere when Mor’s old friends came; she was not in the marriage market and had no mind to be stared at, up and down, by any wife-hunter! But Mor kept her eye on her the live long day. Luckily the talked-of-son didn’t come with his parents to tea, but Else was stared at nevertheless, and asked many questions by the visitors, as was her sister Karen, who blushed and stammered some at each; and Else knew they questioned Mor too, on the side. All the rest of Yuletide her mother kept buttering-up the not-so-young man in her presence, at every opportunity, till she grew sick of his very name, could she remember it. On the twelfth day of Yuletide however, the son himself called, unexpectedly, to pay his respects to the family and ask their pardon for not coming before. Else tried to withdraw but was not quick enough; she hoped he would set his eyes on Karen, for she was so willing for a suitor. She could tell Mads liked him right away. He turned out to be well educated, by his conversation, and witty and pleasant too. True, he was a bachelor, but not as old as some, and he was rather good looking, in the Danish way, and taller than Mads and taller than her too. Mette <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-97" title="97"></span> fussed over their visitor, smiling all the time, and you could see right away that she had her heart set on something. As the visit drew to a close, Else thought that she could like this fellow, but when he pressed her hand in goodbye she knew she could indeed! But whether she threw her shoe over her left shoulder that Twelfth Night or dreamed of anyone, only she herself knew—likely she dreamed of war.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Then it was no longer just a rumor but became known for sure that Otto von Bismark, who had just become Prussia’s Minister of State, had readied his newly built-up army, joined forces with Austria, and was preparing to back up the Holsteiners and march against the Danes’ army at Danekirke, winter or not. He wanted war, and the chance to try out his new troops and impress the Prussian King and the Prussian people themselves and show just what this new army of his was worth. The excitement in Denmark became so great at the thought that one could imagine hearing swords clashing in the sky! But that was only the beginning, for when it was announced that the Holsteiners had freed a thousand convicts to march against Jutland, everybody eligible there joined up. Suddenly men and boys were marching on every road and Mads was with them; Mette had no longer been able to restrain him. People came running on every road too, to tell the latest news, and hurried to the towns and stood around on the squares while the bands played under flying flags, In every house girls picked lint, not knowing for what purpose exactly, except that it had something to do with the firing of guns. Farm hands helped make cartridges at the school houses and practiced shooting, day after day, and the most ordinary peasants spoke passionately of dying willingly for Denmark, shaking their shovels and pitchforks and calling back and forth over their fields. Yes, war was all drums and flags and passion at first, but after that came the killing!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To Danish minds “Danevirke” was a myth surrounded by historical romanticism; for actually the embankment was useless. In most places it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-98" title="98"></span> had long since collapsed or been washed away. Originally, only the eastern boundary had required defending, for the country to the west was all bog and marshland. But now it had dried up considerably, and furthermore the meadows and marshes froze over and thereby became as firm as the rest of the land. Here then at Danevirke were gathered 40,000 Danish men, hoping to hold a front some 60 miles long, if and when the enemy attacked. General de Meza, who had the full confidence of his troops and the reputation of being fearless, was a “cool commander”. He spent his time at his headquarters setting French sonnets to music or designing ivory handles for his broom. He was meticulously careful about his health and fussed endlessly over his uniform and his white gloves, even though war was at his very tent door and the enemy was taking its position near by to prove it! One morning, after taking his regular ride around his defense lines he wrote in his diary,“I was shot at! I do not understand what they think they are doing.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Feb. lst, 1864, the combined Austro-Prussian army of 60,000 crossed the Holstein border and marched northward. It would have been impossible for General de Meza’s outnumbered forces to hold Danevirke against them, and he knew it. He called a retreat of his troops and in the middle of the night of Feb. 5th, the whole Danish army crept stealthily away toward the north, over iced-up roads and with a fierce snow storm blowing full in the faces of its endless, trudging columns. After hours and hours of weary marching the Danes set up their new defenses at Dybboel Hill, where there was a chain of ten rather small earthworks. Their enemy had noticed nothing till next morning, but then immediately took up the pursuit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout all Denmark the news of the Danes’ withdrawal from Danevirke, their ancient defense line, glamorized by tradition, gave the Danish subjects a jolt and the shock was almost more than they could bear. A great howl went up, and the people wept and wrung their hands and mourned as they had not done for generations. The government, fearful of the blame, hurridly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-99" title="99"></span> made a scapegoat of General de Meza and had him dismissed, (Some said he was a traitor!) This was an unpopular political move, grievously unjust and gravely unwise; but that was not all. The fact began to sink in that Denmark’s present allies, England, Russia, Norway and Sweden, had no intention of coming to her aid, as the Danes had fully expected them to do, but simply stood by and let her go-it-alone against ambitious, war-thirsty Austria and Prussia (who within a few decades were to consolidate into the powerful German Empire).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As these forces gathered against the greatly outnumbered Danish troops, they were also better trained and better equipped with infinitely superior arms, having breech-loading rifles capable of firing off a dozen or more rounds for every one fired by the Danes’ old muzzle loaders, as well as being much more accurate and far-shooting. Their artillery too was far superior, which was to prove catastrophic for the Danish positions at Dybboel. The Germans dug themselves into zig-zag trenches a few hundred yards from the hill, across a wide fjord, and kept firing away until they had completely destroyed the earthworks there. But still the Danish clung to it, week after week, while day after day their soldiers marched up the highway and relieved each other in the shattered redoubts, or lay encamped on the muddy winter fields, and let themselves be shot at.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Else Kathrine sat in her room at the High School in Bested, with her Bible before her. Mads’ letter lay there too where she had dropped it. “The news from the front is not good”, he had written, “all this marching, marching in the mud and snow, with nothing but hardtack and three shillings a day. The soldiers all set up in front to be shot at while the officers ride safe behind”, He had made light of it but she knew it must be frightful in all that cold and shooting. Christen, he had said, was among those missing at Dybboel Hill. (She had wept silently at this, for she was fond of her half brother in spite of his rough ways, and her heart ached for Mette too — he was her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-100" title="100"></span> first-born.) Mads said he had seen their visitor of last Twelfth-Day, the tradesman’s son, during the retreat from Danevirke, and he had asked about her. (So he was in it also!) So far, Mads himself was unscathed, but only heaven knew how long that would be so, for hundreds were wounded and dead already. (She had prayed nightly for Mads’ safety, and the rest.) Her thoughts ran back and forth continually. How frightened she had been recently, the nights of Feb. 13th and 14th to be exact, when that terrible wind visited Jutland, blowing down houses and uprooting trees everywhere in a wild fury, as if heaven itself was in on it! The very schoolhouse had seemed to rock to and fro like a drunken man, and she had wondered then if the great judgment was about to come upon them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else drew a sheet of paper from between the pages of her Bible, as she sat, and casting her eyes furtively here and there to make certain she was unobserved, unfolded it and read what was printed for the dozenth time or more: “A Voice of Warning! The day is at hand when kingdoms, governments, thrones, are falling; plagues, pestilence, famine are walking abroad; whirlwinds, earthquakes, wars, proclaim the truth of prophecy…” It was foolish to chance being caught with such writings - she must tuck the Mormon tract back into the Holy Book again. As she reached for the Bible to do so, a certain line of type, where it lay open, held her gaze: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kingdom and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come…” Ja, Ja, this was the very passage of scripture Elder Hansen had referred to at their last meeting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were only girl students at the High School now and they spent most of their time doing war work, inquiring after their fathers, brothers or sweethearts at the front, or discussing excitedly all the news and rumors which came their way. Their young voices shook with emotion when they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-101" title="101"></span> talked of the foe shooting its way up into North Jutland. Should these Germans gain a great victory in the end Little Denmark might even be obliterated, or at least divided up between the German states and other powers. Ja, Jutland would go to Germany, for was it not well known that “what the German Eagle got its claws into it never relinquished”? There was much said among them also about a hired maid at the school, who had been sharply dismissed recently from her position there, although she had no place else to go to earn a living. It was whispered that she had been “taken in by those Mormons” and was even planning to be “døbt” in their church. A pity it was and a disgrace for all her kindred! The whole affair was supposed to have been kept under cover, of course, lest the school officials be accused of over-leniency. Then there was talk of what the Priest had said when he had come to the High School the past week and delivered a scathing discourse on the evils and perils of joining-up with “that sorry lot of blasphemous sinners!” Then everybody there had been as fired up and in arms against ‘those Mormons”as they were against “those Germans” and still were: — well almost everybody there, that was. How little most of them knew after all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were no L. D. S. cottage meetings being held then in Bested for the Danish Elders who had been there conducting them had emigrated to Zion Land quickly, when the war looked imminent, or had been forced into the army. Elder Lars Hansen was among the latter; Else supposed he too had been fighting at Dybboel with the rest. She had first met him at a Mormon meeting early the past spring, where she had gone, at the invitation of her last year’s roommate, to see and hear the Mormons for herself. Her whole way of believing had been changed from that time on as she had marveled at each new gospel message given. This winter she had been present at many more Mormon meetings and her heart and soul burned with the truthfulness of the things she had heard. Her great desire was that her precious family should also hear and believe these wonderful new doctrines. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-102" title="102"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">At sea, the Danish fleet remained superior, as usual, and kept the German ships from coming in to help, but the German troops needed no help from anybody. They took Dybboel Hill from the Danes, who had hung onto it desperately for eight weeks against the great odds, A terrific bombardment, 18 Apr, 1864, drove out the last of the brave defenders, who pushed north to Fredericia, last remaining fortress in Jutland, and from thence evacuated the peninsula and scattered to the various islands, leaving the whole of it in the hands of the Germans, who by now outnumbered the Danish soldiers by perhaps ten to one. The Danes had lost upwards of 5,000 dead, wounded or prisoners, while the enemy’s losses were set at about 1,200. The victors soon took possession of both North and South Jutland and oppressed the people by collecting one war tax after another in rapid succession, though they never crossed over to the Islands. They won what they were after, for the discouraged Danes gave up at last, and the Peace Treaty, 1 Aug. 1864, gave the Austro-Prussian Germans all of Holstein, Laurenburg, and almost all of Slesvig (Schleswig). The final terms were not ratified until 30 Oct., at which time Denmark was required to give back all the German warships her navy had captured, besides. So for a time the hated enemy reighned supreme in North and South Jutland, and forced the Danish officials to collect their taxes. Peace being finally restored, the hostile armies vacated, having nearly ruined the land by heavy taxations and general depression of business, which was the unavoidable consequence of the war.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime the reduced family of farmer Anders C. Christensen went about its own business as much as possible and and attempted to right itself after the upset to the country, and carry on in Nørhaa. There were no male helpers at home, or to hire, so Anders sought the aid of his daughters. Else, having returned from High School and being the most skilled at outdoor things, worked side-by-side with her father, planting, milking, and even shearing the sheep they kept for their own use. She could shear as sheep or drive a team as well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-103" title="103"></span> as any man. She was now of slightly more than medium stature, strong, straight and well-proportioned; a capable, gifted young woman from the Vikings way back in a straight line, and from the nobles too, on her mother’s father’s side. Next winter she would be a full fledged teacher and work with children in a school in Bested.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But there was one thought foremost in the mind of Else Kathrine Andersen as she worked and planned ahead. One day she said to her father, — “Are you never afraid of the day when you must stand before God’s judgment?” Looking sideways at her he answered, “‘Twill be time enough when the old bell tolls for me!” She had hoped to engage him in serious conversation about the life hereafter but never could seem to. He was not a religious man. Mette too was hard to approach on these matters, for her mind was so well occupied with material things, besides being intent on keeping a home of refinement befitting descendants of noblemen; also, it seemed, there was that never ending question of husbands for her daughters. So many country girls never had proper chances to marry and now so many young Danishmen were losing their lives in the war.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the beginning of August the Danish soldiers began trickling home. One happy day Mads returned to Nørhaa and he was well and whole; it was not like this with all who were mustered out. There was joy in the household of Anders and Mette then, and they put out flags to show it! Else threw her arms around her brother in embrace and exclaimed, “We must thank the gracious Lord for sending you back safely to us.” But Mads laughed, “Nej, it is those Germans we should thank for being such poor shots.” Then Mette chipped in, — “Ja, we are all such weak people, and since we can do nothing for ourselves all is spoiled for us; everything must be given us from above by the Great God Father.” “But we are not puppets”, Else had cried, “to be moved around by strings. Ja, we are weak but we can be strong — so much in the end depends on us ourselves, Don’t you see that God expects us to strive and sacrifice for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-104" title="104"></span> his blessings; to work out our own salvations and earn our own places in his: kingdom?” She was sobbing then, but with the rest there was silence, and each one looked at her in some strange way. Presently Far shook his head; “It is the bitterness of this war and the future of our kingdom that worries us all and makes us think strange thoughts. Our Else has been working too hard, but now that Mads has come it will be eased for her.” And that was the end of that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen didn’t come then; perhaps he was a prisoner, since there had been no word of him among the thousands dead and wounded. It was the prisoners who would come last. Word had it that the tradesman’s son had returned home and nothing would do but that Mette should send Mads over there right away to invite him and his family to a celebration for the return of their sons. Else seemed to forget all her worries about Christen in the possibilities of it. It is probable that the invited family came, but that their son came and came again and again was surely so; for Rudolph, the tradesman’s son, had set his heart and mind on Else Andersen when first he saw her. (We shall call him Rudolph, for lack of a better name having been told us.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those were happy days for Else then, in spite of the battling of her thoughts. It was more often Rudolph now who sat with her on the bench by the cottage door, listening to the nightingales cry, or walked hand in hand with her in the fragrant autumn evenings, as they talked and came to know each other better. He listened attentively to her when she spoke of her new-found wisdom, which was more than her family seemed to do, to any good purpose. But she dared not tell him yet half of what she was thinking. He agreed with her on many subjects, but on religious matters he was most often silent, although once he said, following some comment of hers, “Strange as it may seem, here on the earth there are numbers of religious groups with different philosophies, many of which think that they alone are God’s true disciples. But the center of them all is Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, and he, with his Almighty grace, will <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-105" title="105"></span> have us all gathered home to himself when that great harvest day comes.” What could she say to that? Elder Hansen would have known the answer right away!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Else asked Mads what he really thought of her admirer he replied, “Ja, he’s good enough for some girls but not good enough for you.” A typical brother-answer, but she knew Mads liked him. Mor plied her with questions about him night and day; it was easy to see which way the wind blew with her. Her dear sisters, Karen and Stine, not fortunate enough yet to have suitors of their own, volunteered eagerly to do sewing for her brides-chest; while twelve year old Marie, happy and gay, was always hanging on Rudolph in her flighty way, whenever the chance came, showing off. Far said little about him in her presence, but looked on with seeming approval, though she knew the time would surely come when he would feel obliged to speak to her sweetheart and ask him of his intentions with his second daughter. Else began to spend more and more time in Rudolph’s company and regard his opinions more highly also; but just how, when or where she first fell in love with him only she herself could divulge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Customs have differed in various lands and the marriage custom is no exception. In Denmark, an engagement was considered fully as binding as a wedding. A hopeful couple’s intentions were supposed to be announced by the Priest from the church pulpit for three successive Sundays, and each of the parties involved were expected to be present on all three occasions. Then, to bind the engagement bargain, the groom-to-be would give the bride-to-be a gold band for her finger, at which time it was considered that henceforth the maid belonged to him and they could begin living together if they so chose — and most chose. The wedding itself, whether it followed soon or later, as a matter of choice or convenience, was more or less a formality after that, with a merry festival thrown in of course.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before the late autumn had waned, Else and her sweetheart were betrothed, but whether she <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-106" title="106"></span> consented to the Parish Priest having a part in it we have strong doubts. However, be that as it may, their plans were made. Rudolph would begin raising a cottage for her, while she returned to Bested to teach young children reading, writing and Bible stories, for the Bible was used as a text then in many Danish schools. Come spring again she would return home to prepare for her wedding, but she wished to have a try at teaching for which she had prepared so diligently. She hoped to be a good teacher — and after that, a good wife. But there was another hope which she dared not voice but for which she prayed silently with all her heart, night and day. Oh that her people and her love might be guided to a knowledge of the true and everlasting gospel; this was the import of her prayers. She knew this was a large request — but miracles were happening in Denmark every day, and Else believed in miracles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The families on both sides were well pleased with the engagement, but Mette herself was overjoyed and proud at the prospects of getting so fine a son-in-law — Ja, and from the nobility too, way back! She planned a bright wedding festival for spring; it would be her first opportunity. With difficulty she turned her thoughts to other, more mundane, things. Helping Else get prepared and off for teaching took attention, as did sewing and fixing for Stine who would leave home for the first time to enroll in Thisted City Folk High School. Next year she would take her apprenticeship in a lace making establishment, for that was what she desired. Karen was still working in the embroidery shop, and now Marie put up a fuss to go to work also. She wanted no more of school for she planned to be a housemaid or a cook, and Mor could teach her that. Most Danish peasant girls started working at twelve, she said, to help out. It took some doing to get her back to the schoolhouse, but Mette was set on “deres børn” getting as much education as possible, Far was doing well now with his rents and his daughters needn’t go to find employment so young. Besides the farm and cottage, he owned an extra building or two in town, did “householder” Anders, Then Christen had come back from the war and he was gloomy, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-107" title="107"></span> quickly upset, and he coughed a lot; anyone could see he was not quite well, inside or out. Work was scarce and wages low and he had not yet established himself. Besides, he was a bachelor still and this worried Mette considerably. He was restless and gone from there a lot, days at a time, and none of them knew for what. It might be wise if he, and all of them together, were to attend the revival soon to be held at the church there in Nørhaa, since the great Lutheran Bishop, N.F.S. Grundtvig himself, would be present. The Bishop was traveling all about the kingdom, lecturing at churches and high schools, trying to rally the Danish people from the discouragement, bitterness and lethargy caused by the war and the loss of so much of their land; for now they were the smallest in Europe.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Else lived again at the Folk High School, where she took a few classes and listened to lectures by old men, as she could; but her daytime hours were mostly spent in teaching at another school in the city. She had freedom to go and come, for which she was thankful, as it gave her opportunities to attend meetings without unpleasant explanations. The Elders had returned to Bested too, following disruptions, and cottage meetings had been resumed there. It was not yet considered safe again to hold public meetings in Jutland, because of a new flare-up of mobbings and violence, kindled by the aftermath and frustrations of a lost war. Danish youths, many with nothing much to do but roam the streets at nights, seemed to make a serious sport of persecuting and heckling the Saints. The police now mostly ignored this situation, or blinked at it, but the Danish Priests were still very much in on the “urging” of it, for they saw their congregations dwindling because of this new religion, which thousands of Danes all over the kingdom had joined during the past fourteen years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elder Lars Hansen was back again, with a new companion. Else had such confidence in him for he had taught her the gospel first of all. No Danish Priest had ever touched her soul as he had, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-108" title="108"></span> not even the great Grundtvig. She had been a most ardent investigator before, but now she had come to believe in the Restored Church with all her being. The Elders had told her she was fully ready to be baptised and had urged her to do so, yet she hesitated; there was something of which she must be assured first. Was it not possible, if she waited awhile, that she and her loved ones might be all “døbt” in together? The Elders’ advice to her had been, — “Ja, but don’t wait too long; the devil himself has many tricks for the wavering!” But they encouraged her to continue to be faithful and prayerful, but in the meantime to use all her powers to bring her people to an understanding of the truth, Perhaps she herself was to be God’s instrument in this, if it was his will that they be led to the light.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else considered their words, but she had little faith in herself where her loved ones were concerned. Hers was not what one could call a religious family. True, they spoke of God often and most freely, as did many Danes; but their hearts seemed somewhat turned from him and set on other things. It was as if they but parroted the Priest, though they seldom attended his masses, except when necessity took them there, and on Holy Days of Yule, for excitement. But Rudolph now — she had strange and far-off feelings about him, and stranger dreams; precious little she knew about her lover after all. Her letters home were many and full of affection, as well as of all the carefully worded new religious ideas she dared to putin them. The answers back, however, were far from satisfying; mayhaps they thought her just a ranting child. Rudolph wrote only of love and his impatience for their marriage, and of course about the cottage he was building. Her family too avoided any religious discussions, but wrote of home things and the local gossip, although they were as friendly as always and usually ended every letter with, “A thousand loving greetings from us all!” Else felt she was getting no place with them about the things nearest her heart — no place at all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yuletide came in such a hurry that year — long <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-109" title="109"></span> before she was ready for it. There was plenty of snow, though not too much cold, so that Rudolph could come for her in his sleigh, with bells a-jingling, to bring her home. Her heart gave a leap to be near him, but there was a feeling of restraint also. It was like black and white. It was the same when she came to the cottage too; she wanted to be gay, yet she was sad. It was all so confusing, for her emotions kept fighting themselves back and forth the live-long time. She noted no change in the others. This should have been her brightest Yule. Her betrothed was most often there, attentive and possessive, and she liked it — yet she liked it not. Mette had gone to such great pains with the cooking. The Yule gifts for her brides-chest were elegant and many: - newly made quilts, freshly downed pillows, embroidered cases, sheets and underthings - the chest was now she had to sit on it to shut it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Strangely, the talk then was much about religion and of how the famous Grundtvig had said this-and-that and such-and-such. Had Else heard him? Yes she had, several times. Well? She smiled and passed it off; had she told them her thoughts they’d have scarce agreed. Every discussion eventually got back to “those Mormons!” They talked of recent mobbings and Far said, “‘Tis not good to run with mobs - let the devil take care of his own.” Christen did not agree: - “The devil could do with a little help there”, he said. He was most vicious in his attack on the “Saints” as he denounced them in no uncertain terms, Poor fellow, thought Else, the war had left him mixed up indeed. Then Mads, always trying to make peace, said it was people’s right to worship as they pleased, under the new constitution; then his eyes twinkled, “But perhaps these Mormons have some good in them after all!” My what a howl went up as everybody got into the discussing. Else almost swallowed her tongue holding back the words which were fighting to come out of her. As the heated tirade against the “Saints” ran on it took turns that she dared not try to check, though her cheeks burned with indignation as she listened, eyes cast down. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-110" title="110"></span> There was no use. She feit the tower of words she had built up so high and long to say, crumble and fall about her in a useless heap - and her great hope toppled with it! So she sat silent, as if condemned, but forced a smile to cover up her heartbreak. It was the Great Almighty himself then who would have to produce the miracle with them, if miracle there was to be, for Else knew now full well that she herself could not.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Life moved along into the new year and the weather held good, for a time. Letters went back and forth as before, but the days and miles seemed farther apart for Else K. She wrote no more to her loved ones of religion however, but of school and family affairs inthe main. She asked about the house Rudolph was building — were the rafters raised yet? She spoke of everyday things, but rarely did she mention her coming wedding. From Mor she inquired of Far, the girls, Mads, and had Christen found himself work yet - or perhaps a wife? How were all their kinsfolk - Tante Inger, Onkel Peter and the cousins, and those north in Jannerup and Hundborg, and the rest? “Ja, Ja” Mor had replied; everyone was well and mostly happy and she herself was busy, busy! Her sister Dorthe and husband Anders Simonsen and family, and her brother Jens Hvid of Svindborg, had all sent greetings and said to tell her “hello”; they were all coming sure for the wedding. Even Bedstemoder Karen’s sister, great aunt Maren of Hundborg, hoped she lived till then, though she was feeble. “And receive the most loving greetings from all of us here at home” she had ended, Else supposed she had told everyone, had Mette, but she herself had shut her mind on her wedding; she had far more pressing things to use it for.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those were weeks of anxiety and indecision then; never had she felt so lost and alone. People all around, chattering here and there, seemed so free from care — was she then the only distressed one? Her mind was like a great swing of good and evil going back and forth so fast it almost took her breath away. Else thought sometimes that it was with her as it was with the old Danish saying, — “The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-111" title="111"></span> good things I intend to do I do not, but the evil I didn’t intend to do, I do.” [Romans 7:19] She wanted to do the right thing, but how was one to know always? One thing she did know for sure — she wanted to be baptised more than anything! But what of her family? It would be impossible for her to face them, after. She couldn’t simply walk out of their lives and never come back, could she? Then she recalled the maid at the school — she had almost forgotten those at the High School. What would they do? She had heard that men lost their jobs and that their children were mistreated at school because of joining the Mormons. (Perhaps it was she herself she was thinking of more than her family, as girls her age were apt to do.) She remembered some lines she had learned from Shakespeare’s “Hamlet Prince of Denmark”: — “There is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough hew them though we may.” What were her ends to be - her destiny? The Elders had said so many threw away their destinies for lack of courage. “Ja, we are all weak, but we can be stronga!” She heard herself saying those words, as she had said them to her mother, months ago. So her thinking and her days and nights worried on, tormenting her until she felt at times that she could hardly hold on to their endings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then it was announced by the brethren that a special baptismal service was to be held the latter part of the month and President Søren Jensen of the Aalborg District was to visit Bested for that occasion. Several investigators from there and the surrounding villages were ready to be baptised, and of course “the Lord is depending on Sister Else to be ready too.” Sometimes God’s ways are so mysterious it is hard for one to understand them; but again sometimes they are so plain to those who are sincerely seeking. At that moment all Else Katherine’s old, accumulated worries flew away, for a time, and she was at peace. “Why of course” - if the messengers of the Lord said he was depending on her she would certainly be baptised! No doubt she felt then somewhat as Nephi, that great character from the Book of Mormon, had felt when he said, “I will go and do the things which the Lord has commanded, for I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-112" title="112"></span> know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Public meetings then in Denmark were protected, under the constitution—if they were orderly. The authorities were supposed to be notified a week in advance if any were planned. So the Elders went to the police in Bested, telling them they had engaged a hall for the evening of January 25th, where they would hold a meeting for members, investigators and any of the interested public who cared to attend, with President Søren Jensen as the speaker. The baptismal service would be held earlier that day, but they did not mention that detail to the authorities. They located a sheltered bend in a lazy river meandering northwest through the edge of the city, then turning in a big loop, picking its way southwest again towards Ørum Sound, into which it finally emptied. The weather was cold and streams were frozen over, but Jutlandic winters were ever like this; one could not always choose summer to be baptised.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just before dusk crept down and closed the gates of day, the late afternoon of Wednesday January 25th, 1865, the ice was broken through in the place they had decided on and the baptisms began, followed by the confirmations. There were only a few present but Else Kathrine Andersen was among them, It is strange how warm cold can seem sometimes, especially when one is heated from within by the spirit, Else, clothed all in white, as were the others, hardly shivered at all in the icy water as Elder Lars Hansen “døbte” her, or right after that either as Elder Søren Jensen confirmed the baptism assisted by Elder Hansen and conferred on her the Holy Ghost. Then it was over for her and she knew she would never be alone again, if she kept faithful. She was a Latter-day Saint - a Mormon - and she felt wonderful—so full of peace and contentment! The wet ones changed into dry clothes behind the quilts others held up, brought for that purpose, and then bundled in heavy coats, boots, warm shawls for the women <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-113" title="113"></span> and caps for the men, they all walked together a mile or so through snowy lanes to the meeting hall, close to the outskirts of the city. Others were present there when they arrived, but they were few in numbers and mostly women.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They sang a hymn and someone opened with prayer and then, following the Sacrament, names of the newly baptised members were announced and each stood up. Elder Hansen was in charge and introduced the speaker, Elder Søren Jensen, President of the Aalborg District, “an obedient and faithful servant of the Lord and a great missionary” he called him. Elder Jensen smiled, stood up and, opening his Book of Mormon, started reading from Alma 5:37-40: ‘O ye workers of iniquity: Ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world” (he skipped around some) — “if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye of his fold; and now, who can deny this?” — “For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then, of a sudden, there was such commotion and clamoring outside it was as if the war had broken loose again — shouting, swearing, and pounding of things; nothing could be heard above the din of it! Elder Jensen held up his hand to stay the congregation, who would have jumped from their seats. A rock came crashing through a window, then another. The door at the back of the worshipers was flung open and lights from torches leaped at the ceiling behind. Were they to be baptised in fire now? thought Else. Now they were frozen to their seats with fright. Stones began to fly, someone pounded as if to knock the hall to pieces, and all the time the yelling and cursing went on! Else thought suddenly of the young male students at the school and their threats she had heard so recently; could they have followed her? She clutched her shawl more closely about her face; — dared she look behind? Windows were being smashed again and it sounded as if everything loose back there was being hacked up and flung out into the gutter. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-114" title="114"></span> devil himself was loose in Bested that night! There was deep silence for a tenth of a minute; terrible, stiffening silence. Then a voice close in back of Else thundered out a horrible oath. She knew that voice! Quickly she turned — and gazed straight into the face of Christen! She cried out his name, then weeping came on her. It had all happened so fast. At the cry of her voice, the havocking mobbers hesitated, then turned and rushed from the hall as suddenly as they had come, Christen in the lead, and dissolved into the night, taking their torches with them; while Elder Jensen still stood there at the speakers’ table, like a Danish statue, his hand raised as if in benediction. Who could have dreamed that a miracle would happen that night?</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">In the last part of January, a terrifically hard winter had set in, with snowstorms and frigid temperatures in all the Scandinavian countries, “freezing the Baltic and the Belts, breaking off all steamboat communications, as well as stopping the railroad trains for several days. This made the sending of mails and traveling not only inconvenient but very irregular, on account of the great depths of the ice and snow.” In Thisted Amt, where there were no trains then, public coaches were delayed or stopped entirely for a period; children were kept home from school; church meetings were discontinued temporarily; farmers were hard pressed for the safety of their livestock; and all people who could manage it stayed indoors till the worst subsided. It was most unusual, even for Denmark; hardly anyone had ever remembered so bitter a winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the stagecoach, bound for Nørhaa, jolted along the snow-clogged road at the pace of a snail, Else reviewed the events of the past two weeks, Her busy mind kept throwing itself back to unpleasant happenings, those she cared least to recall: — that dreadful night of January 25th; the uproar at the High School a few days later; her dismissal from her teaching position, when the “Lensman” had shouted at her some vile accusation, which burned her cheeks even now as she remembered it; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-115" title="115"></span> the trudging through the piles of wet snow with her little identification book which needed to be stamped against her leaving, and the impudent questions of the police at the time; her hurried packing right after, and the utter loneliness she had felt at having all her bridges burned around her in Bested.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was no one else in the north-going coach for her to speak to, except the old coachman, who was busy with his pipe and his own thinking, as well as with the oft-stumbling horses ahead. Else pulled her coat and shawl more snugly to her in the drafty vehicle, settled the robes closer around her legs and placed her booted feet more firmly on the heated stones again. Nothing could keep out the chill of this Jutlandic winter, she thought, and surely only desperate people like herself would be traveling in it. Though exhausted, she couldn’t sleep, for the choppy movement of the coach kept throwing her back and forth; and besides, her feelings were all mixed up inside her. She feared the worst at N&amp;slash;rhaa, for she had received no letters from there since her baptism, even from Rudolph; though she had thought she would faint with expectation, What had Christen told them, if anything?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else was going home now to ease her mind, one way or another — but supposing she were unwelcome there? Her lips quivered at the thought. She had given up her hopes of the family joining the Restored Church, there was too much bitterness in them against it. Neither would Rudolph join, she felt now, for he was narrow-minded like the rest; nor did she suppose he would hold her to their wedding bargain, once he knew, for he was proud too, like her mother. She was surprised at being able to banish him from her future so lightly, but marriage now held little charm for her, especially with a non-member. At first she had considered emigrating, if worst came at home, but this took lots of money, she had heard, and she had little enough, having been unable to collect the last due her at the school because of leaving her position “on such short notice and for such bad reason”, the authorities there had said. How quickly she had grown from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-116" title="116"></span> girlhood to womanhood in the past few months.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else ate her cold lunch as she rode along, and turned her mind back again to Bested and her last few days there. In her anxiety at losing her position and all, she had sought out Elder Hansen for comfort and advice. He had taken her to the humble cottage of some friendly converts, where she had found lodging, till she knew what next to do. They had talked then of her problems, for she had needed to talk to someone with sympathy and understanding, more than anything. She had spoken of her uncertainty of things at home, her present unhappiness with her marriage bargain, and even of emigration - but her lack of money for it. She wanted to do the right and wisest thing, she had stated, but above all she wished to do the things her Heavenly Father desired of her, no matter how difficult or sad, though the thoughts of grieving her family and being forced to separate from them in harshness, if so ‘twas proved, would be hard indeed for her to bear. Other employment she must have, and soon; she was willing to work at anything, she confessed, but where in this terrible weather would one go to find something?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The good and kind Elder had listened patiently all the while, as she had talked herself through in a constant flow of words interspersed with tears; then had drawn something from his pocket and shown it to her. She herself had received no letters lately, but Elder Hansen had; and one in particular in which he thought she might be interested. It was from an old friend of his whom he hadn’t seen since the war, Elder Lars Christian Myrup. He and his missionary companion were then laboring in the most southern part of Thisted Amt, at the village of Kobberø, near the water. Here they were- teaching a fine family of investigators, a well-to-do farmer and his sickly wife, together with six children, three of them very young daughters who were in much need of a governess, their last one having left in haste when they let the Mormon missionaries into their home. The Elder said he had a great desire to help those good people find someone for their little girls, particularly since he found himself in the awkward position of being <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-117" title="117"></span> the “mischief-maker”, having been one of the Mormons they let in, It would be the greatest and most friendly favor, he had written, should Elder Hansen find someone responsible in his area who could qualify. An intelligent, personable, capable Mormon sister would be most desirable, since this would not only solve his immediate problem but might also be the means of hastening the baptisms of these family members. He was especially set on these baptisms, Elder Myrup had confided, since he had his eyes on the eldest daughter. Then he added a P.S. — “The farmer can afford to pay well but the applicant must be able to furnish proper references, of course. “Of course!” — Else remembered how her hopes had tumbled at this last, but up until then she had been listening with mounting eagerness to the letter recital. She had thought, Who now would give “proper” references to a runaway Mormon convert? Most of her few pleasant memories lately had been thus sprinkled with bitterness, like black pepper. Elder Hansen had spoken then, as if in answer to her thinking, — “I will vouch for you myself, Sister Andersen, if you desire the position; and I promise you, in full faith, that you shall obtain it, if this be so!” Then, since she was silent, considering, he continued, “Who can say but that if you are frugal and diligent you may be able to emigrate in the spring? Elder Jensen, myself and others of my family from Jutland, are leaving for Zion in early May on a ship the church has secured. There is much chance of employment in the valley of the mountains and I have friends there who would help you.” All of a sudden she had blurted out, before she could stop the words, — “Are you a bachelor then?” And Elder Hansen had smiled and answered, “Nej - I have a sweet wife and new-born son in Aalborg. I haven’t seen the wee one yet but they say he favors me.” After a pause, and rather raspy then, as if her throat were dry, she had gotten out the words, — “I will take the position - and be most thankful for it - but first I must go home to Nørhaa and bid goodbye.” Elder Hansen himself had bid goodbye then, after having promised to write his friend Lars in Kobberø and make all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-118" title="118"></span> arrangements for the position for her, and let her have word of it in Nørhaa as soon as a letter came back. He had taken the address of her parents to reassure her, Else herself had stayed on a few more days at the humble cottage and then boarded the first available stagecoach going north. She remembered again, as the horses tugged and strained at the coach in the deep snow under the fitful prodding of the coachman’s whip, the lines she loved from “Hamlet”, — “There is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough hew them though we may.” What will be will be, she thought. She had done the best she knew - what came now was up to heaven. But it would be so good to be home again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was past dark when they arrived at her parents’ cottage. There was no one standing at the door to greet her for she was not expected. The coachman’s sharp commands to the flagging animals, the flash of swinging lanterns, and the grinding of coach wheels to a stop, however, brought a pull-back of a curtain at the front window and then a loud calling inside — “Far, Mor, it is Else!” Then the door was flung wide and Karen was there on the stoop in one and the same breath nearly. At the same moment giggling Marie flew out from the kitchen, and there were kisses all around as her sisters helped her carry in her valises and boxes. Her father stood up smiling from his chair, putting his pipe away, reaching out as she ran to him and almost smothered him in her embrace. “Else, my Else”, he almost sang it; “to think you should have come back to us on your eighteenth festival!” She had forgotten her own birthday. “February 9th, eighteen years ago,” Far continued; “how well I remember - it was almost such a night as this when you first came to us. We were expecting someone then - a boy I had hoped”, and he winked at her in the old way. Then all was well here afterall, Else thought; but where was her mother? She went then and stooped to plant a kiss on the pale cheek of the ailing Stine, for she was sitting by the fire, propped up in a big chair, smelling of mustard plasters and other remedies for her old complaint. She’d been brought from the school at Thisted, she said, for the damp and cold had set her breathing queezily again. Else <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-119" title="119"></span> seated herself by the fire then and her father insisted on pulling off her boots and shoes and chaffing her feet, as he used to when she was a little girl — but there was still no sign of Mor. Karen poured a cup of coffee and brought it steaming to her where she sat, and just then Mads stomped in from outside, clearing his boots and shaking his great coat and, in his surprise, would have taken her in a bear-hug, coffee and all, had she not saved herself. Christen was the only one absent now, they said. Else was glad for that, but kept worrying about her mother, for it was so unlike Mette to stay out of things. She wanted to ask about her but something held her tongue; perhaps she feared to shatter the sweet contentment of those moments.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then they put her to the table with Danish soup and dumplings, ladled out piping hot from the kettle; the rest had eaten, they said. Else thought she would founder — no one could make soup and dumplings like her mother! Having thought of her again she needs must ask then, “Is Mor ill?” Karen leaned to her quickly and whispered, — “She has been so distraught about you since she heard, but she will see now that it isn’t true and feel well again.” So, thought Else, her premonitions were not unfounded. Then her father cleared his throat and added quietly, “There have been some rather ugly rumors here about you, daughter, and Mor has taken them rather badly. She is a proud woman, as you are aware, and has had many high hopes for you. Go in to your mother dear and tell her all is right with you.” “But of what am I accused then?” Else asked, sparring for time and words in which to tell them the worst, though she had rehearsed this moment and the words a hundred times over in her mind. She longed to be spared the ordeal till morning at least, for she was so weary. But Mads said, looking straight at her, “Christen says you meet and pray with Mormons, for he has seen you at it! I fear he has said the same all over Nørhaa and elsewhere, by now.” Then Rudolph knew also, she thought quickly; but yet she hesitated. Still, what had she hoped to face here afterall but this? At last she said, rising, “I will go in and speak to Mor.” But of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-120" title="120"></span> sudden Mette stood in the doorway of her bedchamber, disheveled, with eyes red from weeping. “I will save you the bother,” she said in as cold a voice as Else had ever had from her. “Tell us,” she half commanded, “we are all here but Christen; tell us - Can you deny these things that have brought us all down to disgrace in our homeland?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was no other way out then for Else, so she turned and faced her family squarely, almost as if at bay, expecting the worst, and told them in as gentle a manner as she could: — “Ja, Christen did not lie; all he said is true - and more. I am a Mormon now. I was baptized the very day of the night he saw me, I have been dismissed from my position at the school too, because of it, so have come home to you. Is there else you would have me go in this weather? Is there anything wicked in believing a better way or living a better life?” Her voice quivered to a halt then; she had been surprised at her own courage but more still that they all stayed to listen, even Mette; although she started speaking again the minute Else had ceased. “What of Rudolph then - have you no feelings for his pride? Do you expect to hold him to his wedding bargain?” Else sensed a faint flicker of hope in her mother’s voice at that last question, but answered, “Nej — I could not put him to such great test of his love. Though I still regard him fondly as ever, I could never marry a non-Mormon now; so I shall pray him to free me from the bargain.” Then she took the gold band Rudolph had given her from her finger and laid it gently on the table by her, asking Mads if he would take it to him and beg him to come there to the cottage that she might ask his forgiveness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this Mette flung herself back into her bedchamber and onto her pillow, with noisy weeping and wailing. Then Stine was seized with such a coughing and wheezing spell that both Karen and Else rushed to her and moved her arms up and down and pounded lightly on her back, until she was relieved; and then Karen helped her to her room to bed. Marie would have stayed there with her ears wide, had not Far sent her to her bed also. Without a word, Mads had picked up the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-121" title="121"></span> ring and readied himself for outdoors again, looking less than happy about it though. Soon only Else and Anders were left standing there by the fire and Else turned and threw her arms about her father, sobbing, “Far, I love you!” But Anders put her gently off and sank into a chair, head in hands. She hurried then and knelt down by him, for she still had much to say; yet when he turned his face to her at last, the words stuck in her mouth at the sight of his unhappiness; and it was he who spoke first then, but it seemed painful for him for his voice shook with emotion, “Else”, he said, “Your whole life we have tried to do nothing but good for you. I remember when you were a tot, how you rode on my shoulder and hung on my hair till it hurt, but the pulling-hurt was sheer joy because I loved you so much! Ever since then you have been hanging onto my heart-strings and pulling at them, as have all the rest of my offspring, but your clasp has seemed firmest and strongest, somehow. Now this terrible thing has come on us and it seems as if those strings must snap in two. Why didn’t someone warn us that our child was in danger?” He paused for a moment, then went on: “True, you are a woman now, but to your mother and me you are still just a child grown dearer. Can’t you give up this foolish nonsense daughter and be one with us again?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Else considered thoughtfully for awhile and at last spoke, — “Would you have me deny the great truths the Lord himself has planted in my heart? Would you have me throw away a glorious salvation?” He cut her off sharply then — “Salvation, salvation” he almost shouted. “All those rantings and goings-on about salvation. I should have had my wits about, last summer, before it was too late! Do you think the ‘All Father’ is pleased that you have humiliated us before our townsmen, friends, kinsfolk and the very Priest himself? Is he pleased that you should put your mother to her sickbed with grief? Why would so great a one give us such a wonderful daughter and then take her away thus? Nej, nej, Else; ‘tis the very devil himself has done this to you - and to us! They are of the devil, those Mormons, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-122" title="122"></span> it is better that you were dead than be one of them, No other Mormon shall ever set foot in this cottage, I vow it!” Karen, who had returned to her sewing place meantime, could no longer pretend not to be listening, so quietly plunging her needle in and out, and spoke to her wrought-up father, — “You can’t mean what you are saying, Far dear; surely all is not so bad and Else will come to her senses by and by.” Then she turned to her sister in kindness, — “You may sleep with me in my bed as you used to.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Silence grew heavy in the room as all three sat where they were for a time. Then Anders blew his nose furiously, stood up, put more wood on the waning fire, and went into his bedchamber without another word or back glance. Karen too got up, saying she would warm the bed first, and taking Else’s night valise from the corner went into her bedroom. Else still sat there on the floor, utterly dejected, hoping Mads would come soon. It was too late now to expect Rudolph. Likely he would come tomorrow. She doubted that she could sleep for she was sure her thoughts would never lie down and be quiet after all that had been said to her, though there was a numbness about her as if she herself were past thinking and feeling. Finally Mads returned and came and sat in the chair by her. He was gentler than she had expected and she broke down and cried some. He patted her arm as it lay on the chair’s arm, and told her the outcome of his errand. “Ja, just a liquid promise that ran off so quickly”, Rudolph had said as he took the ring back gladly enough, “A bargain I am well pleased to be rid of, with one who prefers ‘Mormon Elders’ to my company. Else need not worry about forgiveness or more about me either, as I’ll be off in the next coach for København again. The Danish girls are prettier there!” This flippancy in Else’s former suitor had put her brother on the defense in her behalf, although they both knew the unkind words spoken were only slapbacks f or hurt feelings or injured pride - who could tell which?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Else told Mads how their father had spoken to her, and wept again in the process. She said she could not bear to stay there much longer in the face of it and Mor’s unhappiness too. She <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-123" title="123"></span> would only wait now until she had a letter from the Mormon Elder in Bested, assuring her of her new position. If that didn’t arrive — well, she just couldn’t bear to think of what then would become ofher. “Nej,” she answered at his questioning, she could never give up the new church and its teachings, even if it meant giving up her beloved family, which she now feared might be required of her. She prayed for them all constantly, she told him, that they also might be converted to the truth and come to the same understanding that had brought her such joy and hope for the future. Go from Nørhaa she must though, one way or another. She had faith that the Heavenly Father would direct her in the path she should take. Mads shied from the religious side of things but told Else that if she needed money he had some saved from his war pay which she was most welcome to. She shed a few more tears at his thoughtfulness. Then he told her something he had never spoken of before at home; how he had fought side by side with a Mormon Elder in the war and was beholden to him for saving his life at Dybboel Hill, “All on our side were brothers in that war,” he said, and Else answered, “All are brothers and sisters every day, everywhere, for are we not all God’s children?” So they sat there softly talking, as friendly as ever they had been. Not until the sound of sobbing had long been overcome by snoring in their parents’ bedchamber had they said goodnight and retired.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the surface the following few days and night passed somewhat as usual in the cottage, with things never again getting completely out of hand as they had that first night of Else’s homecoming. Here was a family of no ordinary peasant upbringing and its members generally knew how to behave and did it, all except Christen that is. Else was treated with courtesy, for the most part, and her needs were well taken care of. But there was an underlying strain between Else and her parents, neither of them caring nor daring to speak more to her of what was between them, or she to them, lest the tension explode again into bitterness as before. Mette had ceased her weeping, in the main, but ignored or avoided her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-124" title="124"></span> daughter; engaging herself instead with sundry things in her bedchamber when she was not cooking some of the things Else relished most, in the kitchen, as if to remind her what she would be missing once she left there again. If the two did meet, at meals and the like, the older woman was silent with high head and evasive eyes; though truly there was a certain dignity in the way she put it over. Only once in those days did she forget herself and speak impulsively before she could check it. “Any natural mother would try to keep her child from walking into a fire” she said, as if in self defense, And Else thought, “So, it is burning she fears for me now!” But once started her mother had gone on passionately: “Do you realize what you have done to yourself? Anyone who leaves the State Church is not able to marry legally or have their children christened or their dead buried. Have you thought of that? Do you realize what you have done to us besides?” As she stopped for breath, Else put in sincerely, — “Forgive me Mor; I love you dearly, in spite of our differences and would give anything to be able to heal your sorrow.” Instead of offering the embrace Else ached for then, her mother had flung herself into her bedchamber again and thrown back over her shoulder the words, “You should have thought of that when you gave your family up to run with Mormons!” Nothing short of her leaving would satisfy Mor now, Else thought; then an idea had filtered through her unhappy mind:—It was not her mother’s heart but her pride that was shattered; not only her plans but her love too, that had been forced aside. How her mother seemed to have changed towards her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Change had come over her father too. A Danishman is king in his own household, and so it had always been with Anders, in spite of a “husfru” like Mette. His own children adored him, for he had been a splendid father. Else had never known him to rule with anything but love and gentleness before. This man who mostly now sat so glum and brooding, when not busy outdoors with his livestock, was a stranger to her. There was no merry twinkle in his eye, no sharpness of wit and humor, no enthusiasm for her accomplishments, no fond<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-125" title="125"></span> embraces. Yet he had not been unkind to her since that first night nor had he spoken ought of scorn or blame, or avoided her. But their infrequent conversations now were small talk, unimportant, impersonal; for in those days after her eighteenth birthday, Far never again spoke to her of deep-down things he felt sincerely or the matters she longed so desperately to hear about—understanding—forgiveness—love! She sensed behind the words that remained unsaid, the little things he might have said and didn’t, the firm unbending of his will—like a stone. Still she herself felt little change in her love and respect for Far, or Mor either; it was deep hurt she felt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The frost held on outside, and inside the cottage as well, as far as Else and her parents were concerned at least. But there were some pleasant hours for her, mixed in with the gloom, whenever the undercurrent of unhappiness was lulled awhile in the company of Mads and her sisters. There seemed little change in their friendship for her, although the girls were more restrained. Mads was like an anchor in a storm and she clung to the security of his concern for her and cherished each few moments they had been able to be alone together. Karen had helped her clean and mend her clothes and select the ones most useful to her should she go to be a governess. Else wondered if it were less for the pleasure of being of service or more for the chance of reindoctrinating her into her former faith, that she helped; for Karen was by far the most devout Lutheran of them all. Especially when they were together in bed at nights would she say things, such as, — “Just believe and live as you choose Else, but be a Lutheran, not a Mormon.” It was as simple as that to the sweet Karen, for she seemed unable to grasp the difference between faiths. Stine now, like Mads, had been as loving as ever. Else had spent much of her time talking to this ailing sister and tending to her. “You have more of a way of making me comfortable and less ill than the others have,” Stine had said, when she rubbed her; “Such wonderful hands to ease pain!” Marie was still home all day for it was yet too cold and snowy for school. She had hung on Else <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-126" title="126"></span> a lot and seemed to think she was something to be viewed with wide eyes now, “Are you really truly a Mormon?” This question her thirteen year old sister had asked many times over in those seven days; for now a week had passed since Else came home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else had prayed constantly and fervently in her heart that the letter would come from Bested soon, bringing her relief from the fix she was in. She could not bear to stay on and grieve her parents longer, nor could she go without a place to go. Day after day she had watched for the mailcoach in vain. None had come to the cottage, whether on errands or to call or visit, although word must have gotten around that she was home. Even Christen hadn’t come, and for this she thanked heaven. It couldn’t all be blamed on the weather. Else couldn’t help but suspect somehow, in the face of it all, that besides Christen, the neighbors, her kinsfolk, and even her dearest friends and girlhood companions, were speaking evil of her now, It was strange too, but she imagined that the likenesses of her very ancestors, in their old frames on the walls, were looking down on her sternly. In other days, long gone by, she was sure they had smiled when she chanced to look up at them. Yes, Else was in a fix all right and only heaven knew the end of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But on the eighth day the horn of the mailcoach came blowing at the cottage door. Marie ran out quickly and came back bearing a letter for Else. It was from Elder Hansen in Bested and held wonderful news. The well-to-do farmer in Kobberø, Christen Christensen by name (the same as their half brother’s) had sent the price of her coach fare, plus a request that the young lady come at the earliest moment, since they were in much need of her there. Then it must needs be that Else should ascertain the leaving time of the very next stagecoach and make arrangements to travel south on it, as well as go to the police in Nørhaa for the signing of her little book. Mads accompanied her, lest she come to some harm in the town through which she must walk. After that came the packing, she could manage nothing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-127" title="127"></span> but the necessary things. There were all the things in her brides-chest to consider, all the treasures her mother had saved up from her babyhood and put in. She went to it by herself and opened it, almost reverently, to have a last look. She had room for none of those lovely things; she would come back for them sometime. Yet nestled on top was a small wooden box Rudolph had carved and given her. In it were her amber things, beads, ear-drops, brooch - and the Dagmar Cross from her other confirmation. Ja, she would take those to remember by, they would take so little space in her valise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By pre-arrangement, the coach came by for Else next day at noon. She went at once to the door of her mother’s bedchamber to say farewell, but it was shut fast. There was no answer when she called “Goodbye, Mor” through the wood, though she stood there hoping for a moment. The rest all came outside to see her leave, even her father. Mads put in her valise and boxes and the lunch Karen had prepared, plus a little jug of hot coffee and some warmed rocks for her feet. She kissed each one goodby, one by one, and embraced them fondly, even her father, though she had only slight response from him in return. But then he said quietly, as if to her ears alone, “If you ever reconsider and change your mind daughter, you will be welcomed back.” Those were his last words to her, for then he went inside fast and closed the door, as if afraid of himself; but Else’s heart was cheered some. As she boarded the coach then and sat down, turning to wave farewell to the others, she saw her mother’s face at the front window, looking. That was the last she ever saw of her.</p>
