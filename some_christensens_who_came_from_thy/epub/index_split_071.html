  <h2 class="calibre9" id="sheldon-bartholomew-christensen">Sheldon Bartholomew Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(25) Sheldon Bartholomew Christensen (2) as he himself explains, “Was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Nov. 27, 1905, on Seventh East and about Wilmington Ave., in a small dwelling with outside plumbing. Sixty-three years later I am still living in Salt Lake City, Utah, now on Melodie Ann Way in a large house with inside plumbing and a mortgage duly amortized.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In these brief words Sheldon B. spans the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-782" title="782"></span> greater part of a lifetime of activity, service and success. But there is more, much more to be told. By tracing the goings and comings of his family we can form a skeleton of his early life and by the writings of his brothers and sisters can put a little flesh upon the bones and a bit of blood into the veins. However, he alone can add the spirit, the character and the personality to his story.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe:— England, Denmark, Germany, France - all beckoned his family when Sheldon was going on five, with the winter of 1910/11 being spent mostly in Germany. His sister Edythe tells that with their return to Utah, he could speak only in German. Can you imagine him trying to explain to his Grandmother Bartholomew, of English origin, his desire for some bread and jam?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Provo, Utah - was where he started school and where his family lived in three different homes in the three years it spent there; Rexburg, Idaho - was again the family’s home for three years, with winters spent in school and summers at various garden and farm assignments, since Sheldon’s parents were well agreed on the disciplinary value of work, and where he received a patriarchal blessing, along with others of the children; LaVerkin, Utah - residence of his family for a year, 1917/18, and where he again attended public school. His sister Edythe tells about living in LaVerkin, “As summer arrived in earnest with its dry, hot heat, we were settled in a four-roomed log hut situated on the rise of a hill which looked down upon the murky Virgin River. It was pretty desolate, Lizards scuttled over the sandy soil among the sage and greasewood. To the west rose the remnants of an orchard of almond, fig and pomegranate trees… The log hut was furnished with only makeshift hand constructed pieces. Comfort facilities were a distance from the place and our refrigerator was the usual ‘Dixie cooler’. Our main duty outside of the home was to take turns ‘watching’ the springs where there was a bath house of sorts to which travelers or townspeople came now and then to bathe in the healing, sulphurous waters, and for which privilege we collected a fee and gave aid and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-783" title="783"></span> service, We moved into a brick house nearer town in time for school.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hinckley, Utah - this became the abode of the Christensen family for the next year. Wendell tells of the long, hard trip Sheldon and he made in hauling the family effects by team and wagon to their new home, which Edythe describes as follows: “A two story white brick structure became our home in Hinckley. It was on the out-skirts of town, the usual mile or so from school, and stood on a small farm, the outlook of which was rather bleak since the land was of a dry alkaline quality. Sugar beets grew in spotted acres but alfalfa and especially its seed proved to be the main crop of income. The older boys, Wendell and Sheldon, were teenagers and, under the supervision of mother, trying to farm the unfruitful acres mostly alone and craving a bit of fun on their own, I’m sure.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The younger brother Luther was not aware that life was anything but fun at Hinckley for there were animals there. He tells one incident: “It was customary to turn hay over when it got wet and my brother Sheldon was sent to do this. The hay was full of little field mice and sometimes we would find a rabbit. Sheldon took a gun for this purpose, One day I went along and as Sheldon turned the hay he saw a rabbit. Quickly he grabbed the shotgun and put a shell in - but the rabbit got away. I had been snapping the empty gun at the mice previously and as Sheldon put the gun down I picked it up to continue my game and almost got his toe with the shell.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sheldon makes this comment: “I cannot share anyone’s view that there was bleakness at Hinckley, LaVerkin, or any other place we lived. To me they were all wonderful areas. Each had its own peculiar charm. Really, the only bleaknesses I have experienced in life have been my own delinquencies and vagrancies. True, I didn’t invent stupidity but often I have brought it into exquisite focus.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Star Ranch, north of Nephi, Utah provided a home for Sheldon’s family for the next several &lt;span id=“page-784” summers. Though the older children were expected to work hard with the crops, cattle and other chores, yet it was somewhat of a paradise for them nevertheless, as each was given his own riding pony. The beautiful setting amid lake, lush meadows with wild flowers, nearby canyons and mountains, offered spots for recreation during happy leisure hours. Edythe writes, “We were by ourselves and our entertainment was had with each other, picnics, rides together up the draws of nearby canyons, etc. These were busy, beautiful summers. We always attended church when possible. I recall the first time father drove our family to the LDS Sunday School at Mona. The structure where it met was an early rock model of pioneer vintage. There was but one hall; the few class divisions were made by drawing curtains. As our car stopped in front for us to alight we noticed the door and windows being filled with curious spectators. Flushed and a little embarrassed we managed to walk the long path and into the sanctity of the building.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Provo, Utah - again became their home during those winters of 1919-1922 in order that the children might attend school. Edythe was in college and the older boys in high school. An epidemic of influenza hit the city and Edythe writes of this, “The first seige of the flu struck while we were at Hinckley but our family had escaped. But at Provo the winter of 1920, one after another of us took to couch or bed except father, who had gone back to Star Ranch. Even mother and the baby became ill. The grade schools closed down. We were only one family of the majority so afflicted and it was impossible to obtain a nurse. Our overworked family doctor was only able to call a few times. Many died but our group was spared to slowly recover.” Luther has many happy memories of those Provo days - bringing the Christmas tree down by sleigh from the mountains; skiing on barrel stave skis from the top of the chicken coop; gathering watercress in early spring from nearby pasture brooks and selling it in bunches.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Salt Lake City, in a house on the bend of the Jordan River, was the family’s next home. Financial reverses had struck at its roots and all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-785" title="785"></span> those who could were forced to find work outside the home to help out. Edythe was called to interrupt her studies in Boston and came home and found immediate employment. Wendell and Sheldon went to work. It was somewhat of a discouraging time for all - but they went ahead bravely. Sheldon writes something of those days:— “When Wendell and I pursued our first employment opportunities there was one situation that should be documented. Rather interestingly, one of Father’s visionary projects, which was associated with some reproachable promoters, landed Wendell and me on a job at Santa Fe Springs, Calif. in the heat of a new oilfield boom. We were assigned to a small, half-baked (literally) experimental oil refinery. Our wages were largely deferred, so we lived for months in the corner of a machine shop and subsisted on rice, canned milk, sugar and unclaimed Valencia oranges from half dead trees abandoned to ruthless overkill of machines and spray of crude oil. We were merely roustabouts or flunkies. At best it was dirty work and we were far from best. Little did we know we were making history in industry,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The refinery technique was dubbed the ‘Wade Process’. The objective was to force through a nozzle low grade crude oil into coils within a high temperature kiln, which coil encompassed iron shavings to serve as catalists. There was a piping system from the hot coils into a condensation tower so that the initial volatile product was practically usable gasoline. In other words, we were actually cracking the heavier complex hydrocarbon compounds into lighter fuel through the employment of heat, pressure, etc… . Oddiy enough, this spot in Santa Fe Springs was a historic place. Crude as our plant looked, it was still the first oil cracking plant in the world. From this small beginning all of the major oil companies received franchises for cracking plants around the globe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It is with pride and satisfaction that Wendell and I look back, knowing we contributed considerably to the development of a process so important to transportation throughout the world. Nor would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-786" title="786"></span> we have been there except for father’s procuring the job for us. After four months the process rights were sold. We got our pay but lost our jobs.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pulling together has lifted many a load, and so it was with the A. B. Christensen family. It was soon able to move to more desirable quarters in Salt Lake City, at 1876 South Main Street. This was to become an eventful site in the lives of the children. It was in the Farmer’s Ward and there was a wonderful group of young people affiliated there, including Nancy Howells and Mary Pratt, who later became the wives of Wendell and Sheldon respectively. It was from this home and Ward that both the boys left for missions to Germany, Wendell in 1925 and Sheldon in 1926. Since the family finances were still at rather low ebb, the boys were helped mostly by profits from their mother’s sewing. It turned out that Wendell had the privilege of being Sheldon’s first District President in the mission field. With their former experience in Germany as children, the language was no problem for either of them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sheldon returned home in June 1929. On 16 Sep. that same year, in the Salt Lake Temple, he was married to Mary Urie Pratt (b. 10 Aug. 1907 in Farmington, Utah to Mathoni Wood and Agnes Urie Pratt.) They became the parents of four sons and have sent three of them on foreign missions for the church, one to Denmark, once the home of the Christensen’s ancient Viking progenitors, one to Uruguay and one to the French Mission from which he has just returned (1969). Mary is serving as a member of the General Board of the YWMIA, while Sheldon himself has served in bishoprics, on Stake missions, and in various other church assignments over the years, both in California and Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He has been successful in business. First he worked for years as an independent insurance broker, dealing largely with estate planning, deferred insurance plans, pensions, profit sharing, and life insurance as applied to corporations, estates and businesses, Eleven years ago (1958) he went into the securities business and organized a broker dealership which was qualified <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-787" title="787"></span> with the Securities Exchange Commission, National Association of Securities Dealers. He eventually turned over this business to his son Neal and a partner, who are operating it very successfully. For the past four years Sheldon worked independently in securities. Again last November he qualified as a broker dealer in the securities business.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His work has taken him into California, Idaho, Nevada and Utah where he has worked on some very large accounts. He works directly with businessmen at “face value” basis rather than on a referral basis. This actually requires a great deal of courage and skill on his part but he has been rewarded with much success. He usually goes in “cold turkey” as the expression goes, but comes out with warm friendships and contracts. He often takes “long shots in the dark”, such as the time he sent a strange businessman a check for $100.00 along with a message that if the receiver would give him enough of his time to allow him to explain how he could save him thousands of dollars in his business, and was not convinced, he could keep the check. Sheldon received an appointment, a good sized contract, and his check back. This kind of selling not only takes courage but also imagination and creative ability as well as a convincing way with words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some years ago Sheldon took some time off to study creative writing as an added tool in his business. He applied his skill in writing “Life Line”, a sales presentation of which 50,000 printed copies were sold; and in a series of eight articles titled “You and Your Estate” which were published in the Deseret News 1948/49. But his creative writing has not been confined to business matters only, by any means. He has published a novelette, “The Bequest” and a short story in Look Magazine’s “My Favorite War Story” series. He tells of this:— “While attending the Maren Elwood school of writing in downtown Hollywood during World War Il, a poem was received from a sea captain who lost his ship, depicting unusual bravery of a crew member. The poem was offered for sale to class members. Being an opportunist I bought it for $3.00, rewrote it in story form and submitted the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-788" title="788"></span> same to Mr. Gunther, west coast editor of Look Magazine. The story was duly purchased and published. I still have the original poem.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sheldon’s face really lights up, however, when he discusses his present creation, a full length novel “Promise Me” a story of “Licit Love”. Incidental to the story is a full length tale of a conversion, a subtle by-product of the main plot. He has been dreaming of and working on this novel for some years and at present it is totally outlined and with six chapters (10,000 words) completed. He explains, “In addition to keeping kept-up with family, church, business, ever current reading as well as some television, I am in the throes of a major literary undertaking which began a few years ago and will likely extend through a number of future anniversaries before publication. Herewith I feel my undivided, feeble efforts will be best employed. I’ve given up hunting, fishing, and I don’t play golf. I love to walk and when I walk alone my mind is completely occupied with words, phrases, events, characterizations and a potpourri of tales.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sheldon, businessman, churchman and writer, is the middle one of A. B. Christensen’s three living sons. He is not as large or tall as Wendell and not as thin as Luther, but in looks he seems to resemble his father much more than either of the others. Perhaps his dreams are more like his father’s, for Andrew also had visions of writing, and to get himself into a financial position to do so he struggled and strove, though unsuccessfully, to the end of his days. Perhaps he will succeed in this through Sheldon, as he will succeed in others of his dreams through his other children - who knows now? We have no better glimpse of Sheldon’s sensitive nature and keen perception than in the words he wrote of his father’s death:— “Father died alone in a modest hotel room in St. George… Traveling in the severe cold of that December 1931, I arrived at St. George about fifteen hours after Father’s passing. In the last moments of his life, despite complications of pneumonia and diabetes, still he bothered to wind his inexpensive timepiece. I remember well, I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-789" title="789"></span> cried as I held the watch, knowing that as long as it ticked a last bit of Father’s tremendous energy still remained. Whether he really died of a broken heart or was mercifully taken in illness, I do not know. But of one thing I am certain - there still remained an unsubdued determination and dignity about him to the end… He possessed the marked tendency to deny himself in his valiant effort at reaching for the stars.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One time, when a group of us Christensen cousins had met to discuss the writing of family histories, Sheldon, among them, brought out the point that he thought the bad should be mentioned along with the good, and then he said something to this effect, “If, after I die, someone writes my history and ‘flowers’ it all up - I’ll come back and haunt them!” Now we have no fear of the dead returning on such missions, but to arouse the ire of the living is a problem we do not wish to encounter. It is thus with humility and some trembling that we present this skeleton sketch of Sheldon, who terms himself “something of a nut”. We hope that someday he will find time to “breathe the breath of life” into a worthy history of his own. Until then, however, he has left this testimony: — “God has been kind to me. I have been blessed and preserved. I am grateful for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and membership in His church. I am cognizant of a wonderful heritage, wife, family, brothers and sisters, etc., etc… Each year life becomes more fascinating. Times have changed since I was a boy, but I still love cooking over an open fire and eating out of the fry pan.”</p>
