  <p class="calibre1">(7) Giles Elmer Christensen (1) born 4 July 1899 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Elmer writes: “I was christened Giles Elmer but later changed to Elmer Giles. When I was a boy father wasn’t home much. I remember while we were living in Gunnison Father came home one spring after having been on the desert all winter with the sheep. His whiskers were long and red and I didn’t know who he was. So when he came over and kissed mother I was shocked. He left and I told mother I was going to tell Father that she let that man with the red whiskers kiss her. Later Father came back from the barber shop with the red whiskers gone and of course I recognized him then and told him about the man with the red whiskers kissing mother. Father sure got a kick out of that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I started school in Gunnison and then when we moved to Salt Lake City (1910) I finished the fourth grade at the Roosevelt school on 33rd South 9th East in Salt Lake, and that was the end of school for me. I ran away from home and went to California. But I didn’t stay away very long and soon went back to Utah and father put me to work at various things on the ranch or herding sheep. But he wasn’t with me very much when I was on the ranch or herding sheep either.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roy and I used to take turns working on the ranch in Wyoming called ‘The Oasis’, Roy was there the fall of 1917 and I was working on the dry <span id="page-687"></span>farm in Cedar Valley. One night in early October I dreamed, or imagined I saw Father standing in the door of my tent. Though he said nothing I knew something was wrong. The next day they brought me word of the accident that caused his death. I was eighteen at the time. After his death I continued to work for the Bennion Livestock Company herding sheep for awhile and then I went into the army. After the war was over I went to work in the mines, first at Ruth and then at Ely, Nevada.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was in Ely, Nevada in 1929 that I married the widow Frances, or ‘Fannie’ Tanfield Marsh. She had three children by her first husband, Jack, Don and Mary Marsh. I didn’t adopt them. Fannie died in 1932 so I left Ely and went to work in the mines in Colorado at Alma, Fair Play and Leadville mines. From there I went to California. Then I joined the army again and was in it from October 1942 until February 1944. I was stationed on the island of Honolulu in Hawaii. I was cook there for about a year so I was made a Sergeant.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I then came back to California, I drove truck here in Los Angeles for E. Willardson Plumbing Company for twenty-six years and then, after they went broke, I went to work for F.C. Schilling Plumbing Co. and worked for them for three years. I remarried here a widow by the name of Mrs. Norah Kathleen Makerove. She doesn’t like the name of Norah so we call her ‘Kay’. She had a five year old son, Ronald Makerove, whom I raised as my own for eighteen years, although I never adopted him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My life isn’t very exciting now for a few years back they sent me to the hospital with heart trouble. (He also has emphysema). Now they won’t let me work so I have retired and just putter around with the flowers here on the place and am getting fat and lazy. In the First World War I was known as Giles Elmer and in the Second World War as Elmer Giles. Now I hardly ever hear either of these names as everyone down here calls me Chris.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elmer is the only one of the Christensen descendants to have served in both great world wars. He has no children of his own. He is now <span id="page-688"></span>living in Los Angeles (1969) with his second wife, Kay, and enjoying life as he approaches his seventieth birthday, in spite of his ailments and limited activity. They say he raises the most beautiful flowers!</p>
