  <h2 id="and-should-they-die" class="calibre9">AND SHOULD THEY DIE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">In Gunnison little Ada grew paler and weaker, but still she smiled from her sick bed as the Christensens made every effort to ease her pain and try to make her happy. She had lived much longer than had been expected, under the strain of an inefficient heart, during which time she had endeared herself to the entire family with her sweetness and patience. At the turn of the new year, 3 Jan. 1897, the child passed quietly away. She lacked a little less than two months of being nine years old. She was survived by her real father and stepmother, two own sisters and one brother, as well as her foster parents, Laurs and<span id="page-343"></span> Else Christensen, and nine foster brothers and sisters, who mourned her passing in very truth, for she had left a vacant place among them and a sweet memory that could never be replaced. Indeed this gentle little soul had done her best to shed happiness within the home where she had been so lovingly welcomed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Little Ada was buried on the Madsen plot in the Gunnison Cemetery beside her own mother Sarah and baby sister Almira, and near the grave of a little half sister, Ethelind Florence Madsen, who had died soon after birth six years before. Ada’s tombstone bore this inscription:— “In loving memory of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and Sarah Madsen - Born Mar. 14, 1888 - Died Jan. 3, 1897 - In sore distress your life has past - You loved us all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is thought that both Laurs and Else were among those who attended the wonderful celebration that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of the first pioneers to Great Salt Lake Valley, 24 July 1847. The year 1897 was an extra special Jubilee Year in Utah. In January plans had been made by the State Legislature to “conduct a celebration that would attract national attention.” Gunnison Valley residents joined the crowds, the largest ever seen on Salt Lake City streets, to witness the spectacular events of the five day semi-Centennial celebration - the dedication of the Pioneer Monument surmounted by the bronze statue of Brigham Young - a reception for all surviving pioneers - daily parades and speeches - a carnival and fireworks. On Sunday, 24 July, a memorial was held in the Tabernacle to honor all deceased pioneers. Laurs and Else wore their official “Pioneer Badges” to many Pioneer Day celebrations. These were among their cherished treasures.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But most cherished of all their treasures were of course their children. It is wonderful to have parents who uplift and encourage their children to pursue challenging goals and who support them when they meet the inevitable frustrations and reverses of life. Not all were as fortunate<span id="page-344"></span> as the sons and daughters of Laurs and Else Christensen in this regard. We know of one little girl who was born in far-off Sweden. When she was about three years old her father took his own life and her young mother was forced to return to the shelter of her father’s home, taking her little girl with her. A few months later another little girl was born to this unfortunate young mother. The embittered father, though a widower in failing health and needing his daughter’s care, seemed to begrudge her little children even the crusts of bread that went into their mouths, making things most miserable for them all. It seemed an answer to this unhappy mother’s prayers when she received a small sum of money, coming to her children from their father’s mother’s estate, their grandmother who had emigrated to Zion and died there. With a prayer for wisdom in her heart, the young mother had taken the precious money and paid the fare for her oldest daughter, then six years old, to go to Zion to the home of some of her father’s other relatives there, in fact, his half-brother who lived in Salt Lake City. The little girl was sent in the care of some returning Mormon missionaries in the fall of 1895. The mother had planned that somehow she and her other little girl would join this older daughter in Zion in the near future - but this she was never able to manage. The small Swedish emigrant’s half uncle in Salt Lake City was a polygamist, with two wives and two separate families. Times were hard for them and money for the necessities of life was scarce and with many mouths to feed little Anna Theresia Carlson was not too welcome among them - neither did she speak the language. After a time she was shifted about among various families here and there - Salt Lake City - Schofield - Gunnison - Centerfield - finally winding up, when eight years old, in this latter place in the home of an elderly couple whom she never learned to know well or feel at home with and who were in no way related to her, as far as she knew. But they sent her to school in Centerfield for the very first time, with her lunch wrapped up in paper - a sandwich of dry bread spread with bacon grease. She was always hungry. So after a few days of school here she ran<span id="page-345"></span> away, or rather wandered away and became lost - and nobody came to find her. A mid-September dusk in 1897 found Theresia in northwest Gunnison, hungry, cold and forlorn. She fell asleep that night on the steps of the Relief Society Hall. The shouts of happy children gathering on the nearby school grounds next morning awakened her. Lonely and disheveled she sauntered over to join them, but the school bell sounded and they rushed into the schoolhouse and she was left alone again, having no desire to follow them in. Nobody seemed to mind her and she hung around the school until morning recess brought the children out again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She joined a small group of girls, seemingly about her own age of nearly nine. She was a stranger to them and questions flew fast: ‘Where do you live?” She said she didn’t know - which was probably true. “Where are your father and mother?” She had no father and her mother was far away. “Don’t you have a home?” No, she had no home - no place to go. Among the group was a tender hearted little girl whose last name was Fredrickson. She lived just kitty-cornered northwest from the Relief Society Hall nearby. She took Theresia home with her and told her mother that her new-found friend had no place to go. “Can’t she live with us Mother?’! Sister Fredrickson, overburdened with a large family, answered, “We’ll see”! and her daughter scampered back to school, leaving the strange little Swedish girl in the hands of her mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sister Fredrickson looked the child over, she was a beautiful girl but so neglected looking. After trying to make her feel at home and listening to her tearful little story, told in halting, broken English, she considered the situation while Theresia ate hungrily of the food she had given her. Then the kind Sister said, “I know just the place for you my dear. Some people down the block have recently buried a little girl about your age. Come along with me!” And so they went west to the end of the block. Sister Fredrickson and Anna Theresia Carlson, whom henceforth we shall call “Tresia”, but let her tell part of her own story.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was shifted about from one family to another until I didn’t have a place to live. A lady knew<span id="page-346"></span> someone who had just lost a little girl named Ada, so we went to see her. Sister Christensen called her husband in from outside and they talked things over and then said one more mouth wouldn’t make any difference with them: so I was taken in. It reads like a book. They were so wonderful to me! There are no words written or spoken that are good enough to describe them. They treated me as their own. If Vena got new shoes - I got new shoes; if Vena got a new dress - I got a new dress. The rest of the family were grand to me too.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So once more the Gospel of the Master came into action in the home of Laurs and Else Christensen of Gunnison, for had it not been said, “Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only… dry up the tears… comfort the sorrowing… ease the pain of the sick… share with the hungry and needy…” And little Ada’s empty bed was filled again and Elvena had a playmate and companion in the home, younger than she by nearly two years, to be sure, yet in the matters of the world, much older and wiser. They went to school together and Tresia took the surname of Christensen as long as she lived with them and attended school there in Gunnison, which was for some six or seven years after that. Today Tresia lives in Maricopa, California and is in her eightieth year, the only one of those living today who once mingled intimately within the confines of this Christensen home. And how well she remembers those days when first she came to dwell there. Vena was the only one of the family attending school then in Gunnison, except herself as mentioned. Christian was of course married and mostly away with the sheep; Andrew too was married and teaching in Kanab; Joseph also married, was teaching in Centerfield but living in Gunnison; Albert was beginning his first year of law school back in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Elsie was also teaching in Centerfield and driving back and forth; Emma was teaching in Spring City, and seventeen year old Louis and fifteen year old Chris with the various herds, although Papa and Mama, as Tresia always called Laurs and Else, would have much preferred having them in school. And what teases those two younger boys were!<span id="page-347"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Death struck often in those early days in Gunnison Valley and the Christensens and their loved ones could not always escape the hand of the Grim Reaper. Laurs’ youngest sister, Sena, or Nielsene Christiana as she had been christened, had had some misfortune with her children, having lost four out of nine sons sent her over a period of twelve years, three of them one after the other. She had been wed to Anthony Madsen 18 Oct. 1883 some three months after the death of her sister Maren Myrup, when she was twenty-one and Anthony, who also came from Kobberod, Jutland where she was born, was twenty-three. Sena’s tenth son was born 21 July 1898 but died the same day before he could be given a name. Sena herself, youngest child of Christen and the gentle Karen, followed this last of her little ones in death the next day, 22 July 1898, which was the fifty-first birthday of her brother Laurs. She was thirty-six. Mother and babe were buried in the same casket in the Gunnison cemetery. Anthony Madsen married again in less than five months, for he was sorely in need of a woman’s help with the five surviving sons, the oldest nearing fourteen. He was wed to a Danish girl, Nielsena Necolena Dortary Nielsen, or “Lena”. The ceremony took place in the Manti Temple 14 Dec, 1898. On this same occasion the necessary work was done for the departed Sena and she and Anthony, with all their sons both living and dead, were sealed together as a family for eternity - and Lena stood for Sena. Lena herself gave Anthony two sons and two daughters but only one of each kind lived to present him with grandchildren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are times of exaggerated sadness accompanying death. Who can say whose passing is most mourned, that of a much loved child, a young so-much-needed mother, or one of the “Old Ones” who goes to the grave trailing his accumumulated years of struggle, courage and overcoming behind him? Christen Christensen passed away Tues 21 Nov. 1899 in his eighty-third year, going down like a fine hewn log, an honest man well seasoned with experience and great faith. He wasn’t sick very long; pneumonia took him. He seemed to know he was going and ‘tis said that in<span id="page-348"></span> his last hour he insisted on Anne straightening and smoothing down his clothing all around him, wishing to be as immaculate in death as he had always tried to be in life. If, as some Danes believed, there was a gathering of all one’s dead ancestors over the earth at an Old One’s passing, then there must have been a great unseen host of both relatives and friends waiting to greet Christen Christensen from Thy, when he died. He had done so much for the living over the years, and he had done so much for the dead, laboring consistently in the temple not only for his relatives but for great numbers of his deceased friends as well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This was an honorable man and his word had been as good as his bond. Not only had he served and loved man, both the living and the dead, but he had loved animals too, especially fine horses. He had reared many thoroughbreds in his day and was always kind to the dumb beasts. We have been told that he was very particular about housing and feeding his animals, never going to bed at nights until he was sure they were all right and had plenty to eat. Their stables and mangers were cleaned every day. He studied about animals and numbers of people brought their ailing livestock to him to be treated. We like to think of Christen Christensen as somewhat of a thoroughbred himself; for, though homespun, he was a fine and noble gentleman in every way - and from the ancient Danish Vikings in a straight line. But there was little fanfare when they laid him away in Gunnison - no bell tolled for him. Red flags of warning were on many gateposts there for the whole town was under quarantine for smallpox. No inside congregating was allowed so the funeral itself was held outside in front of the home in the bleak day-dark of Sat. Nov. 25, 1899.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen was survived by Anne and five of her six children, three of Karen’s children including the eldest son Christen in Denmark, numerous grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, Andrew, son of Laurs and Else, was then attending school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One night he saw his grandfather Christensen, dressed as for travel and with a valise in</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-349"></span> his hand, come walking through the door and up to the bed where he was sleeping. The surprised Andrew asked, “Where are you going?” His grandfather Christen replied, “I am going to Denmark to hunt my genealogy”, and then he disappeared. A few days later Andrew was informed of the death of his grandfather, 21 Nov. 1899, the same night the old gentleman had visited him in a dream or vision.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For some years Anne continued to live in the old home, together with her son Joseph who never married. She was a humble woman of great faith and always thanked her Heavenly Father every day, even for the small things of life such as a good bed to sleep in. She had been very good to Christen and Christen had been kind to her. They had spent some thirty-three years together, sharing the hardships and sorrows as well as the joys of life, among the latter of which could be counted their labors together in the beautiful Manti Temple. Christen had been able to raise money to bring Anne’s sister, Mary Jensen, over from Denmark and get her established in Zion, which was also a great joy to Anne. During her later years she sold the old home and she and Joseph moved closer into town. It was to this new location that Anne’s daughter, Caroline C. Jensen, came often from Axtell to care for her mother in her last days, for she suffered greatly at the end and passed away 3 Apr. 1914 of what was thought to be cancer. A monument of some consequence, as Gunnison tombstones go, marks the place where Christen Christensen is buried, along with his wife Anne and two of their sons, in the Gunnison cemetery.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the grandsons of Christen Christensen grew to manhood in Gunnison, there began to be some confusion among those who carried the Christensen surname and also bore the same given names as other Christensens in that small community. Laurs and Else had a Christian, Andrew and Joseph; Christen and Anne had a Christen, Andrew and Joseph, and there were other Christensen families there at the same time in a similar fix, These same-named individuals were always getting their identities<span id="page-350"></span> and mail mixed up, to say the least. Finally the sons of Laurs and Else decided to do something about it and most of them assumed middle initials and changed the spelling of their surname from Christensen to Christenson; to the latter of which generations of their Christensen progenitors must have looked askance. But no matter, from this, Christian “I”, Andrew “B”, Joseph “C”, Albert “H” and Louis “D” Christenson emerged. Not to be wholly outdone, some of their half-uncles also adopted middle initials but left their surname spelling intact. Thus there were now Christen “K”, or Chris Krat as he came to be called, Andrew “E” and Joseph “Y” Christensen. These name changes were never legalized except through long usage and some of the Christensons eventually went back to the original Danish spelling of Christensen. The spelling of this surname has since been used interchangeably among the various descendants of their common progenitor, Christen Christensen from Thy.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert H. Christenson, now a full fledged young lawyer, married Ellen Virginia Snow, whom he called “Jennie”, in the Manti Temple Wed. 26 Sept. 1900. She was the granddaughter of Col. Warren Stone Snow of Black Hawk War fame. Tresia remembers that Laurs and Else drove up to Manti in a two-seated rig to attend the wedding reception that night at the Snow home, taking Elvena and herself with them. Both of the girls had new shoes for the occasion, As was the custom in those days, a fine wedding supper was held at the home. Tresia especially remembers the small glasses of Dixie wine that stood at every place on the long table. At the end of the meal, when the adults had left the table and moved to the parlor, she and some of the other children, including Elvena and Jennie’s young twin brothers Joe and Ed, who had been given no wine, proceeded to drink up the wine that was untouched. Tresia must have gotten more than her share for the last she remembers she was being lugged upstairs by the bride’s stepmother, Aunt Lydia, and put to bed for the remainder of the evening. These were the<span id="page-351"></span> remembrances of an eleven year old. But those of the twenty-two year old bride were quite different, as Jennie Christensen recalled it thus:—“How my mind will travel back to our wedding night. We, Albert and I, had sewn autumn leaves on the curtains in the afternoon for decorations. That night it was chilly and raining hard, but I hardly noticed it, so bright did it seem inside. We had fires in the grates. We came downstairs, A. and I, and went into the parlor which was filled with guests. What an array of flowers was about the rooms. I remember I was so proud of him!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis D. was married to Sarah Florence Mellor of Fayette, 6 Mar. 1901, in the Manti Temple. Her people had also been among the first settlers in Fayette. But her mother was dead and her father, a polygamist, lived with his other family, while Florence pretty much had to look after her younger brothers and sisters as best she could. Tresia remembers that Florence and her sister made her wedding dress out of white “china silk” which she saved and later used the material to make a christening robe for her first child and daughter LaFaun. The Christensens gave the couple a wedding celebration and dinner at their home in Gunnison. Not long afterwards Louis left on a mission for the Church to the Western States Mission in Colorado (June 1901) but he was not there very long before he was called back home because of the desperate illness of his bride.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie was married soon after Louis left for his mission. This is as she recorded the event in her own history:— “On 26 June 1901 I was married to Alma C. Bartholomew of Fayette, Sanpete Co., Utah, in the Manti Temple by John D. T. McAllister, then temple president. After the ceremony, since we had been invited by my brother Albert and his wife to come to their home for dinner after we were through, we went down to their house on Second West, but found no one home. However, the door was unlocked and a large bowl of lovely fresh fruit centered the table, to which we helped ourselves. My parents gave us a very elaborate wedding reception in their home that same evening.<span id="page-352"></span> There were one hundred invited guests, including four Bishops.” Elsie was twenty-six years old at the time and Alma was not yet twenty-three, for there were three and a half years difference in their ages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the beginning of this new century there were prosperous times in the United States. President William McKinley had successfully steered the Ship of State through the turbulent waters of the Spanish American War which had been largely brought about by Spain’s shameful treatment of her colony, Cuba. So many Cubans died a terrible death from starvation, Uncle Sam stepped in and told the Spaniards that they could not continue their heartless oppression of these people and sent the battle ship Maine into Cuban waters to back up the statement if necessary. The Spaniards more or less thumbed their noses at the U. S. A, by blowing up the Maine. McKinley declared the Cubans to be free and independent and went to war to enforce it. Spain had part of the Philippines in her possession too, and the Filipinos were also fighting for their independence at this time. The U. S. A. sent a fleet into Manila Bay to assist in the protection of the rights of the struggling people of the Philippines and in the fight which followed, destroyed the Spanish Armada there. In a few months the Spanish American War was over, and under the terms of peace Cuba was given her freedom and Spain sold the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and another of their small islands to the United States for $20,000,000. During the war Hawaii requested protection and was also annexed to the United States.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The successful outcome of the war and the prosperity of the country resulted in President William McKinley being elected to another term of office at the general election held Tue. 6 Nov. 1900. The Republican ticket in Utah also won by a large majority. Less than a year after the beginning of his second term of office, or on Fri. 6 Sept. 1901, the President was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. A man by the name of Leon F. Czolgass joined a receiving line where McKinley was shaking hands with people.<span id="page-353"></span> Raising his apparently injured right hand, wrapped in a large white handkerchief, as if to shake the hand of the President, Czolgass fired two bullets into him with the concealed gun he held and, as William McKinley fell, said with satisfaction: “I have done my duty.” As soldiers and spectators rushed to the assassin, the mortally wounded McKinley cried out, “Be easy with him boys.” When questioned, the anarchist stubbornly maintained that he was convinced it was a good thing for the country to have killed the president. Czolgass was electrocuted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All of the nine children of Laurs and Else were of course living at the time of President William McKinley’s assassination. Eight of their grandchildren were alive at the time of McKinley’s death - Chris and Caroline had daughters Pearl and Elora and sons Elmer and LeRoy; Andrew and Sarah had a son Adelbert and a daughter Edith (later Edythe); Joseph and Roxie had a son Harold, but had lost three little babies straight in a row after that; while strange as it may seem, Albert and Jennie had their first child, a daughter Virginia, on the very day President McKinley was shot. All of the nine Christensen sons and daughters were sventually given away in marriage. And though this giving may have seemed a sacrifice to Laurs and Else at the time, it proved to be a blessing like “bread cast upon the waters”, returning to them after many days numerous grandchildren to honor and cherish their names.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">—Grace Noel Corwell</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl remembers when Joseph and Roxie moved into their new home in Gunnison. They had a big house-warming and the place looked beautiful for the occasion, especially inside. The parlor walls were blue and rope had been gilded and tacked around near the ceiling to form a border, the color scheme being blue and gold. Joseph was then in the bishopric in Gunnison Ward and also teaching school there. Roxie was expecting her fifth baby and hungry for one, since Harold was almost eight.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">October came, and Joseph went to Salt Lake City to attend General Conference and also to be present at U. E. A. which was to be held afterwards. He left his mother in charge of Roxie who was looking for a new baby any day. Else had delivered several of her grandchildren before this, along with hundreds of other babies, but as far as she knew, no one could put more strength into childbirth than her daughter-in-law Roxie. What pains… . what hours and hours of hard labor… how many trips walking around the block, with help from brothers, father or husband… what agony preceded every birth. It would take six weeks after for Roxie to get her strength back. Little of course was known then of modern medicine and the treatment was crude and even rough, but it was all they knew. It didn’t help much either for expectant mothers to be urged to “eat for two” and to be passed seconds at every meal.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This fifth baby was overdue. Finally, on Tue. 7 Oct. 1902, the little girl came, but she had been too long in the birth and was limp and blue and wouldn’t cry. Else took the little one in her arms and, using all her remedies and skills, putting her first in warm and then cold baths, worked against time to save the baby. And as she worked she prayed aloud the whole time - ‘Father please save the life of this child… her two little sisters and one brother are dead… please save her… Roxie and Joseph need this little child… please let her live!” For two hours she worked,<span id="page-355"></span> and cried to the Lord to save little Ruth Ellen, or “Root” as she always called her after. She paid little attention to her daughter-in-law during that time, except to report to her at intervals - “A little moisture on the eyelids… A little color in the upper lip…”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When it was finally safe for the child to be left alone, Else put her down in the place that had been prepared for her and then took care of the mother, Roxie. When all was at last in order, she sat down and wrote her report to her son Joseph, addressing the letter just “Bishop Joseph Christensen, Salt Lake City, Utah.” Another Bishop Joseph Christensen of Salt Lake City, who had been born in Gunnison, where his mother still lived, received Else’s letter. This Brother had no idea his wife was even expecting and it almost caused complications in his home. Years and years later, Ruth chatted with this other Joseph Christensen while he was on a church assignment in San Diego, California, and he still got a chuckle out of that experience. To the ever-thoughtful Else K, this had seemed the proper thing to do on that occasion. She said she often did things she had never thought of doing before, through inspiration, and more often than not things turned out all right. She usually heeded the whisperings of the “still small voice” that came to her so frequently. She was a woman of great faith - and she had such faith in prayer! She had prayed over hundreds of babies and their mothers in the delivery rooms of Gunnison Valley, as she had also worked and prayed over hundreds of others of her patients. But she had also wept as well - wept over some who had passed away.</p>
