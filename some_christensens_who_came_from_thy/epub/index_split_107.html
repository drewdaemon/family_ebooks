  <p class="calibre1">(61) Mabel Norma Christensen (4) writes her own history:- “I was ushered into this world, I’m told, in the midst of a rain and wind storm on the morning of Friday 13 Apr. 1923, in the family home at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the seventh child <span id="page-931"></span> of my father and the second of my mother. I have few recollections of living in Manti however, since we moved to Provo when I was nearing two-and-a-half.  Less than a year later we moved to Orem, Utah and lived on an 83 acre farm which became home to me during the rest of my growing-up years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Climbing up the steep, dark basement steps on my first visit to that home in Orem still clings to my memory. Other features that were to influence our daily lives were the outdoor toilet a considerable distance from the house down by the chicken coops; the water pump just a few feet from the back porch from which all our culinary water was obtained, and damp cloths over perishable food placed in the open kitchen window as a means of refrigeration. But despite what seems to be primitive conditions to us today, I remember no feelings of frustration for lack of conveniences, except when the roosters would chase me on my desperate dash to what I called the ‘lugly tote’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My sister Kathryn’s arrival was a joyous occasion, but during mother’s stay in the hospital the news arrived that her sister Ida had been killed. Her home was right across the street from ours in Manti. The fall after Kathryn’s birth I started school at the Spencer Elementary, thoroughly primed by both Father and Mother as to the importance of an education. Though I didn’t always feel the need of bringing home a straight ‘A’ report card, yet I can never remember being flippant about the grades I received.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As the middle of my second grade year came it was suggested to my parents that I, along with three others, be promoted to third grade then and there. In spite of brother Phil’s special trip home from the U of U to try and prevent this, (he knew of what he spoke, having had three special  promotions himself) I found myself in the world  of third graders. But often the emotional maturity of a child is not sufficient to cope with such social changes, and looking back I find that I was a prime example. It seems I was always at odds with my friends and ended up playing with youngsters either younger or older, <span id="page-932"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“School work I usually enjoyed and seldom encountered much difficulty with it, except when it came to creative writing. An experience that happened in Mr. Cordner’s seventh grade English class provided me with the greatest object lesson in honesty that I can remember. We had each been assigned to write a story, the best of which was to receive a prize. I made several attempts but each one ended in complete failure. Finally in desperation I solicited Mother’s help on the last night before the assignment was due. She agreed to help me but as the hour drew late, sent me off to bed, promising to assist me next morning. I awakened to find a very sweet story she had written available for me to copy. But time was short and the story long so I handed it in in Mother’s handwriting.  I really was feeling shabby about the whole thing when I was called up front to receive a fine Eversharp pencil for winning the story contest. I was appalled - and literally hated the sight of that pencil, and managed to lose it as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“That summer Father bought a house trailer and he and Mother, Cullen, Kathryn and I set out on a trek across the country. First we visited Mother’s brother, Uncle Yates Farnsworth and family in California where the ocean breezes gave me such a stiff neck it was painful to move for weeks. But there we had a most delightful introduction  to ocean swimming, sunbathing - and to 10¢ malts. I also acquired a gorgeous sunburn and went ‘peeling’ across the country. From California we journeyed the southern route to Washington D. C. to meet Phil, who was there attending school and working. From here we went to New York, Chicago, and home. We visited twenty-four states, Canada and Mexico. Cullen was just learning to drive and spent many hours at the wheel in utter joy. One of the most remarkable things about that trip was that we children hardly quarreled at all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have some definite impressions of our family life during my growing up years. First of all there was no doubt in any of our minds as to who was the head of the family. We all recognized <span id="page-933"></span> in Father a man of impeccable honesty and moral character, a person of great determination and courage. He was a man whose decisions we learned not to question, whose stern rebukes were more effective than a physical whipping from Mother or anyone else. But we also knew him as a man capable of a deep love and concern for his family, one who had endured heartbreak and sorrow in the loss of his first wife and a son, one who had weathered crippling financial disasters but who could still hold his head high in the knowledge  that his word was his bond and that with the gift of life came the obligation to live it to the fullest. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have always felt that mine was a strict moral upbringing rather than a religious one. Though we children attended church as the thing to do, Father’s Sundays were spent working at the office, and Mother’s to a large extent at home trying to catch up on her endless duties while we children were away. As my studies became more demanding I found Father’s office an excellent place to work and my attendance at church became less and less frequent. But as my church association  decreased I seemed to replace it to an extent with a very happy association with Father. In addition to many Sunday trips to the office, I was often permitted to accompany him on short business trips throughout the state. His love for life, of the law, his strong political beliefs, his curiosity concerning  the world about him, his love of and pride in his family - all these I felt honored to share; and through this close association I came to know that I could never dishonor this great man and continue to live with my conscience.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Growing up on a farm in a fruit raising community provided plenty of opportunity for hard physical work, and that became very much a part of my summer routine, Many were the days I spent in our strawberry patch from dawn until evening, or packing cherries or sorting peaches;  and many were the nights I can remember that  Mother’s head never touched the pillow, but in the morning tables and counters of jars filled with freshly canned fruit were ample testimony to her <span id="page-934"></span> previous day’s and night’s activities. These were the depression years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Not long after brother Hale’s death I remember  bathroom and kitchen facilities being installed in our house along with a wonderful fireplace; but several years passed before we enjoyed the luxury of a refrigerator. Asking Father for money was a painful experience for both of us, especially if it was for something he considered a ‘frivolity’. So by the time I was in high school I managed to earn enough money to buy most of my own clothes. However, if we needed money for something Father considered worthwhile, such as furthering our education or developing our talents, the money was made available somehow. Many a dollar went down the drain in a vain effort to teach me how to play the piano. But needless to say, my regrets were great and the pangs particularly sharp on occasions such as our family Christmas parties when everyone was supposed to perform.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1940 I graduated from Lincoln High School, having just turned seventeen. As Cullen had done the year previous, I delivered the valedictorian address. To my delight I got a job in the booth selling tickets, etc., for SCERA  swimming pool at 12½ cents per hour and I felt that my days as ‘official berry picker’ were over. Not that they hadn’t been good days, for I remember dashing home from the berry patch or whatever, getting cleaned up and dashing off to play ball until dark, after which I would either spend my night at the ticket office for the SCERA theatre or enjoy the current movie. Our ball team was terrific and we were Sharon Stake champions for a number of years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Boys had definitely become an item in my life by this time but the only fly in the ointment was curing them of their fear of Father. On this particular  subject he and I had great difficulty. I got some comfort out of my sister Elaine’s tales on the same subject. Father later very aptly described his attitude toward his daughters’ boy friends when he said that he had chosen to adopt the English approach to the law in this situation by assuming them to be guilty until proven innocent. Needless to say, many young man’s enthusiasm cooled under <span id="page-935"></span> this icy treatment and even those who survived that ordeal never felt quite at ease in our home. This was a situation I vowed I would ease if I ever had a home of my own.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I experienced a rude awakening in my transition  from a ‘mighty high school senior’ in a small town to a lowly freshman at BYU. The summer after my freshman year Father, Elaine and I accompanied my future sister-in-law, Gwen, to New Orleans, where she and Phil were married. That trip was really a lark. Even my knocking a cow over on a lonely Louisiana highway didn’t dampen our spirits much, since poor Bossy was able to struggle to her feet again and merely gave us a resentful stare. Elaine’s keepsakes to take back to her children were hilarious. I still remember her lowering a bottle on a string down into the Mississippi River for some real muddy Mississippi water and her chipping off some stone from a tomb to show and tell. .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Pearl Harbor attack the next December started many decided changes in our lives. Both Phil and Cullen were frozen to their jobs with the F.B.I, and the following summer I started working for the military at Fort Douglas. I loved my newfound  independence, I had never been happier. Every day was a new adventure. Sometime during that period I received my patriarchal blessing in which I was counseled to return to school and finish my education. So when Father also started urging my return I agreed to enroll spring quarter, 1943. It was hard to settle down to studying at BYU again and I missed my friends and activities in Salt Lake City. In answer to my pleas to return to the University of Utah the next fall, Father agreed on condition that I help him in the office that summer, since he had lost his good secretary and was in desperate need. That was a bargain! </p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Poor Dad! My stenographic training consisted  of three quarters of shorthand and one of typing. But his patience was endless, and working with him that summer was truly a wonderful experience.  I came to love and enjoy him as a real friend as well as a father. I began to see what a great man he really was. I couldn’t believe his <span id="page-936"></span> capacity for work! Alone, with only a second-rate typist to assist, he managed to serve innumerable clients, with his main object being primarily to hold the law firm together until his partner sons could return and share the load - and the business. At the age of 72 he was putting in enough hours for two men. That summer became a very precious memory to me, and surprisingly provided me with enough legal stenographic training to bluff my way later into two excellent jobs - one in the legal division of the State Tax Commission and the other as secretary to the Legal Counselor for the Public Works Committee of the United States Senate in Washington D. C.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When I enrolled at the University of Utah that fall it was like going home. I rented a room at the home of my speech teacher, Mary J. Webster, 222 South 13th East. Living at the Websters’ was absolutely ideal. School was but a block away, kitchen privileges were available, the rooms were pleasant, and the Websters were the kindest and most considerate people alive. They had rented their rooms in the absence of three sons who were in the armed forces. Their oldest, John, had been missing since the previous February and was presumed dead. Ted was serving in Africa and Italy. Their youngest son, Reed, was on the front in Germany. These worried parents seemed to greatly appreciate our company in their loneliness  and literally made their home our home. With the exception of six weeks, this truly was my home for the next two-and-a-half years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the middle of April of my Senior year, word was received that the youngest Webster boy had been wounded in action, and on May 8th the war ended in Europe. I passed my comprehensive examination, gave my oral recital on Ernie Pyle, graduated with high honors, and came to worship my old, fat history  professor, Dr. Creer. I would gladly have been his slave but instead, he hired me to correct papers and do stenographic work for which I received a modest wage. Graduation found me more eager than ever to remain in school; so, with a part time job in the History Department, I signed up for six weeks of summer school as a start on a Master’s <span id="page-937"></span> degree in History.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Toward the end of June I returned to my room one day to discover that the Webster Charm School (as we called the upstairs area, occupied solely by girls and long forbidden to the opposite sex) had been invaded by a boy - a man - well a male! There he was, busily vacuuming the floor of the east bedroom with one hand, the other in a cast from the tips of the fingers to the shoulder, I had caught my first glimpse of Reed Webster, in the flesh that is since I had often seen the picture of him and his girl friend from Buffalo that stood on the piano in the Webster living room. There  may be no such thing as ‘love at first sight’ but let me attest to the fact that there can be instant attraction. I thought he looked very interesting and extremely heroic in that cast. But then I | quickly jarred myself back to the reality that he  was taken and that I had been asked to vacate my room in August so that the young lady from Buffalo could come and visit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Reed was temporarily stationed at Bushnell General Hospital for the first few of many operations  necessary to regain maximum use of his badly shattered right hand and arm. During the next few weeks his periodic appearance on the. scene set in motion an absolute flurry of fun and  excitement; picnics, canyon parties, beach parties and house parties were continually in progress, and I was often included as Reed’s partner. Now the lower reaches of the Webster house, affectionately called the ‘Ratskeller’, rocked with the rumble of masculine voices and laughter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was with real regret that I headed back to Orem the first of August. The next two months was a period of frustration for me. The latter part of September came at last and I returned to Salt Lake most gratefully. Upon entering the familiar Webster front room, I was struck by the absence of a certain picture. It was with real interest that I learned from my roomies that the young lady’s visit had only served to convince Reed that his former army interests really didn’t fit into his home environment. He and the girl from Buffalo had completely severed their connections. <span id="page-938"></span> Why was Iso pleased? After all, I was only one among many of his feminine admirers, as evidenced by the numerous phone calls and visits from members of my sex who were definitely not relatives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Though I registered again for graduate work my enthusiasm for further scholastic pursuits dwindled. So I took ‘incompletes’ in my classes and joined the ranks of the employed. It was fun to have my evenings free for fun. I got a job in the president’s office at the U of U. Every girl should have the experience of living with a group of girls such as I did, and a whole book could be written of the times we had - and in fact one was started by two of the girls and appropriately titled ‘I Speak For the Bathtub’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, my attraction to young Webster was completely frustrating to me. In his presence I felt stupid and speechless, and I knew he considered me an easy conquest. I was too handy for him. More often than not his ‘dates’ consisted of a call up the stairway with an invitation to leave shortly for a hastily arranged beach or canyon party. But when I discovered that the girl he took to formal parties was not me, but one of his  over-eager sorority friends, I plotted by revenge. He would be cut off my list, and the next time he issued his last-minute invitation I’d tell him to go sit in the sand.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The chill from upstairs no doubt drifted down to the lower levels, for Reed began to send out ‘peace feelers’. Soon my wounded pride was soothed and my self respect restored - I was ready to continue this game of cat and mouse with this Webster ‘playboy’. By no means did either of us entertain the idea of going steady. On every furlough  he continued to cut a mighty swath among the local damsels while I managed to provide him with sufficient competition with an ever-increasing number  of young men - most of them recently returned from the service.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The spring of 1946 Reed completely erased my former resentments of his ways of dating me by inviting me to the Military Ball at the University of Utah. It had been years since I had attended a <span id="page-939"></span> formal dance - I was so thrilled! By then I was serving as secretary to Colonel Black in the ROTC. I went shopping for the prettiest gown in town - and I found it! It was the most glamorous thing I had ever seen - a gorgeous, off-white creation of Grecian design, which made me feel as elegant as a queen. The amount in my purse was less than half enough to buy it but that dress simply had to be mine!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Somehow the money was found, And as I descended the stairway on the big night, the look in Reed’s eyes told me that the gown was worth every penny - every 7,500 of them in fact! Following  a most perfect premiere (the fact that an exact duplicate appeared on the wife of one of the commanding  officers failed to dampen its happy influence) that little dress was worn many, many times by me, by all of my tall roommates, by my lovely niece, Donna Southwick, when she was crowned Days of ‘47 Queen, and even by my gorgeous  sister-in-law Daryl. It was one formal dress that literally wore out, and because of the pleasure and service it brought to so many it became one of my most worthwhile investments.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Reed went away for his various operations  he never corresponded with Norma, which left her in doubt of the sincerity of his interest in her and turned her thoughts and consideration to other available young men. There was among them a tall, handsome airforce Captain and former all-American basketball player from West Point, named “Suitcase” Simpson, and there was Harry, a studious medical student whose sterling qualities were beyond reproach. Simpson, however,  was killed in an airplane crash while attempting a landing at Washington D. C. before he could continue his courtship. But Harry proposed  and Norma begged for time to consider. As she came home from that proposal, Reed met her and, fully aware of his competition, asked her to go for a ride with him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Norma writes of this:- “I could think of no means of escape. A short distance from the spot where Harry had proposed not more than an hour before, Reed parked and, in the sweetest and for <span id="page-940"></span> him unbelievable humility, begged that I give him a chance to prove his worthiness of me. Gone was the arrogant, devil-may-care attitude, the fast talk, the wise cracks, the big time show. There before me, stripped entirely of his defenses, was a young man whose face had not entirely escaped the ravages of the past two years of pain but still reflected the hope, the ambition, the tenderness of someone truly in love. Here was the person I wanted to believe existed but of whom I had caught but a few fleeting glimpses. He talked of the two or three remaining operations and the years of college ahead of him before he could earn an acceptable  living. But he pledged his life, his strength, his ambitions to the ultimate purpose of making me happy. ‘Other men may be able to give you more of the material things than I’, he said, ‘but no one else in the whole world could love you as much as I do.’ I said, ‘Go away and leave me alone and in two weeks I’ll give you my decision, for I can’t decide now.’”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reed went back to the army and Harry remained at a respectable distance, but it didn’t take Norma two weeks to decide. On 31 Oct, 1946 the following telegram was delivered to S/Sgt Reed J. Webster, 39910794, McCormack General Hospital,  Pasadena, Calif.: “Two weeks unnecessary to know I love you always. Chris.” So Harry faded out of the picture.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Norma went back to Washington D. C. and stayed with her brother Cullen and family and worked. It was while here that the couple became engaged and Norma writes of this and of their wedding later:- “While spending a quiet evening at home, Cullen, Daryl and the boys having gone on a picnic, we became officially engaged as Reed placed a lovely diamond ring on my finger. We both laughed as he described his journey down to Orem to obtain my parents’ consent. He said he knew it sounded ridiculous but he had felt at the time that he should get down on his knees and beg Dad for my hand. To his relief the greeting had been warm and permission granted without any reservations, Mother of course had kissed him and welcomed him as her future son-in-law. We <span id="page-941"></span> set our wedding date for September 20th.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sherman and Lois kindly consented to having the marriage ceremony in their home at Provo, and Father agreed to perform the rites - it seemed most fitting that Father, as the patriarch of our family and a champion of the law, be the person before whom we pledged to love and serve each other throughout our lives. Thus in a sweet and simple home ceremony the evening of 20 Sep. 1947, Reed and I became man and wife, with just a few members of the family present, Reed’s brother Ted was best man and my dear roommate Dell, a bride of only four months herself, was my matron of honor. The strength of the family name I was now exchanging for another had been a gift to me that I was beginning to appreciate more each day. It had been a force in my life from which I rebelled at times but which had served to protect and help me whenever I was in need. I was now so grateful to be a member of the Christensen family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“And I was, and am, grateful for my maternal backgroun., In Mother I had witnessed a conquest of self far beyond my capability. Hers was an equally strong influence in my life, but in its subtlety went unrecognized for many years. Hers was a truly religious soul, in its self denial - its unending love and compassion for the downtrodden, in its willingness to accept the good wherever she found it. I can think of very few instances in my life when Mother’s needs and desires were not considered least - and last. From the toil, the struggle with the poverty of the depression years, the concern for family before herself, the love she had for family, relatives, friends and neighbors, there emerged a person who is the object of love wherever she goes. No community or neighborhood in which she has dwelt has remained untouched by her kindness and goodness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Even today, at age 84, almost blind and very halt, she receives a steady stream of little  visitors who love to be with her and affectionately call her ‘Grandma’. Letters arrive from all sections of the country expressing love and appreciation  for her. Her soul has reached out beyond her failing body to embrace and comfort and love <span id="page-942"></span> the people and beauties of nature about her. In her example the teachings of true Christianity come alive. She has a flair for writing but through the years of toil she has been unable to devote much time to it and in later years seems to have lost the desire. Unfortunately, this eldest daughter has been careless through the years of many written treasures given by her to me in deepest love. But may I ever cherish the more intangible and deeply significant gifts that are mine because of her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Two ‘wonderful’ years were years of making quite difficult adjustments. First of all, the time had come when I had to try to learn how to cook. For someone who had never prepared a complete meal, this was no small thing. The results of my efforts were very obvious by Christmas time and not entirely commendable - Reed had acquired twenty pounds and five enormous canker sores.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reed Johnson Webster was born 9 Aug, 1923 in Cedar City, Utah, the son of John Urie and Mary Elizabeth Johnson Webster. Since the history of Reed’s maturing years is more or less a history of his married life with Norma and their joint accomplishments, we include excerpts from this as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I believe my first real association with God came on the battlefields of Germany during World War II. Though I had come from a good Mormon home, I had drifted away from activity in the church at about fourteen years of age. I had taken with me, however, the knowledge that there was a God, and as I witnessed the death and destruction around me, I felt a close association with him. I talked with him often, and though I felt most unworthy I never doubted his presence. Proof of his nearness came to me in a special way on the morning of April 10, 1945. In an early morning attack, as I was running along a railroad track, a shell from a German M-88 shattered my rifle, my right hand and forearm, and knocked me several feet across the track. I was momentarily stunned, but when my eyes fell upon the gaping wound in my arm I immediately jumped up and ran back looking for a medic to dress my wound. Five inches of the <span id="page-943"></span> large bone in my right forearm had been blown completely away, as well as one finger and the ends of three others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As I reached the first-aid station, which occupied a factory building that had been captured just that morning, I discovered that a German doctor had also been taken prisoner an hour or two before. He volunteered his services, and within ten minutes from the time I was wounded a skilled medical man was working on my arm, tying off the bleeders, cleaning out the wound, applying a traction splint, and administering pain-killing drugs. There is no doubt in my mind that this man saved my right arm. I couldn’t help feeling that God had had a hand in this. A shell had ripped the front pocket of my jacket completely off without leaving a scratch, I had been only an inch or two away from certain death. I was grateful to God for letting me live, but knew I had done nothing to deserve the gift.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“By noon that day I had been removed to the field hospital for care prior to being evacuated to England. I was transferred from the front to an English hospital, and from there to Bushnell General Hospital in Brigham City, Utah. Though I did not like the idea of being sent to an amputation center, it was just fifty short miles from there to my home in Salt Lake City, and I arrived home in time to celebrate V.E. Day with my parents on May 8, 1945.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The doctors at Bushnell General Hospital insisted that any attempt to rebuild my arm into a useful limb would meet with failure and that I would be much better off with a hook than a useless hand. Being completely opposed to their attitude I finally managed, after six months, to get transferred to Dibble General Hospital in Palo Alto, California. There began the first of a series of twenty-five major operations necessary to rebuild my arm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Those two-and-a-half years spent in and out of hospitals was a difficult period for me, not only physically but emotionally, but were perhaps the most valuable years of my life. During this time an extremely impatient young man had to <span id="page-944"></span> learn patience. I learned from those around me in the hospitals a real appreciation for all my countless blessings. And how I learned to love and feel overwhelming gratitude for my parents! The rebelliousness and resentment I had held toward my father melted into a deep pride in this fine man. No longer did I see him as a naive and rather stupid man who failed to understand the world as it really was, but as an honest and chaste man who avoided the evils of the world because he knew they did not lead to happiness. Though I had always loved and respected my mother, her courage through the loss of my oldest brother, her acceptance  of my disability and encouragement through many dark days, her quiet strength and stability - all  these and many other qualities of goodness made me so proud to be her son. I began to realize that even if I spent the rest of my life serving them, it would not be enough to pay them for the gift they had given me of being well born.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was these same qualities of honor and decency that attracted me to the lovely girl who lived upstairs. It was not an easy courtship during my convalescent leaves. I was not interested in marriage, with so much schooling ahead, and she was not interested in me with the kind of life I was living. It was when I discovered that losing her to another was a definite possibility that I began to realize that she represented the type of life and love I really wanted. The prospect of a life with her gave purpose to my existence and a great desire to succeed and to be worthy of her. I consider my most successful job of salesmanship that of convincing her that despite my poor record in school and rowdy army career I would make a good husband, father and provider.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The month of September 1947 was an extremely memorable one for me, I was discharged  from the army on the 14th, married on the 20th, and enrolled in college on the 29th. The latter was to prove the challenge of my life to that time. I had attended the university for one year prior to the war, during which time studies never interfered with my extracurricular activities, and my grades were an accurate reflection of this - almost <span id="page-945"></span> all E’s and F’s. Because of a difficulty in eye coordination I had never learned to be proficient in reading, and as a result had experienced difficulty  all during my earlier years in school. Since I had been unable to excel in scholastic pursuits, I turned my attention to the social, where I had little problem, and always enjoyed the association of many different groups of young people, sometimes in rather questionable activities. One area in which I gained considerable skill was in mechanics, woodworking and building, and had it not been for the now limited efficiency of my right hand and my determination to achieve an education at least equal to that of my wife, I would undoubtedly have gone directly into some mechanical occupation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“To say that my college degree in business came after much blood, sweat and tears is no exaggeration. The first two years were a living hell to me, and only my reluctance to admit defeat and my wife’s encouragement and patience kept me from giving up. Gradually, however, as my background broadened and I got further into my field, I began to almost enjoy college. It was truly with a feeling of relief, however, when graduation requirements  were filled in December 1950 and I was hired by Masonite Corporation as the factory representative  in the intermountain area. By now I was the father of one lovely young daughter, and in February  of 1951 our second little girl was born. Our marriage had been truly blessed. Not only were we much more in love, but our two children brought greater meaning and richness into our lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After a try at a hardboard fabricating business,  I turned my attention to an idea that had come about as a result of an impulse to examine the possibilities of assisting the young couples in the neighborhood with their washing problems. Living within a block of the University, we discovered  that our home was located on business property in an ideal location for a coin-operated laundry. With the value of the property as our only asset, we embarked on another venture, this time in the laundry business. This required real financial juggling and an unbelievable amount of luck. In recent years I have begun to feel that we <span id="page-946"></span> succeeded only because of the Lord’s help. With no money and a $10,000 indebtedness against the property, we were able to obtain loans during the next few months in excess of $75,000. A friend in the building business hired me to supervise the construction of our building, and a gentleman from Logan leased the space in the rear of the building for a professional dry cleaning store and paid $4,000 advance rent. Without either of these we would have been lost. We were able to buy a fine old home nearby with almost no money down and moved there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The grand opening of our store was on February 28,  1961. By June of that year, after having lost $3,000 in three months operation, the owner of the professional dry cleaning plant in the rear sold us the business for just $6,000 over what remained owing on the machinery, $4,000 of which was the money he had advanced us for rent, payable at our convenience. Our debts on our new venture then jumped to $125,000 and I was the owner of a business I knew nothing about. That we were not among the 97% of new businesses that failed during the first year I can only attribute to the guiding light that came into my life during that time. At times its presence had been so real to me, it’s as though I haven’t been in the ‘driver’s seat’. With at least $4,000 per month required just to meet monthly payments, as well as large amounts required to make property and sales tax payments, I have never ceased to be amazed that to date there has been a way of meeting my obligations. It would indeed be dishonest of me to take credit for this, for I have received guidance far beyond my abilities, without which I could fail, even today,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Prior to tearing down the old family home where we had been living for six years, we were blessed with two more children - a fine boy and a third dear little daughter. We had been approached many times by the ward teachers of University Ward, but still had no interest in church activity. Our two oldest daughters attended Primary with the neighbor children, and occasionally Sunday School. They were extremely concerned over my smoking and on occasion would hide my pipe. One evening, after the children were in bed, I was <span id="page-947"></span> unable to find it and, suspecting the culprit, awakened my second daughter and asked her where she put it. This little girl of nine burst into tears and pleaded with me to stop smoking because she loved me and didn’t want me to die with cancer. She was the little one who, at the age of two, while standing behind my shoulder as I drove to Provo, bent down and looked into my face with all seriousness  and said, “We don’t like cid-o-wets”. I felt absolutely cheap, completely unworthy of the wonderful little souls God had given to me, and I. promised myself, again, that I would give up smoking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In addition to the ward teachers we were visited regularly by members of the ward Senior Aaronic Committee. After considerable urging I accepted the invitation to accompany one of these men as a supervisor on a San Juan River trip with a group of Explorer scouts. My problem in quitting tobacco was licked during this trip. We had also been invited to join a study group at the home of Bishop Royal K. Hunt, which we accepted, reluc- tantly at first, but soon we began to really look forward to our Sunday evening associations with the group and our lessons on the Book of Mormon, and considered it our Sunday church meeting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It came time to move out of the ward boundaries. As a parting gesture of appreciation for all the work our neighbors had been doing on our behalf, we decided to give them a little feeling of success for all their labors by attending church on our last Sunday in the ward. I even decided to take in Priesthood meeting. Mingling with these fine people in these sacred surroundings brought the realization to us of how desperately we hated to leave them. We decided to request that our memberships remain in the ward. Thus began a most rewarding association in the University Ward, and a much better understanding of and warmer relationship with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. We discovered that the gospel brought a greater capacity to love each other, our children and our neighbors, a richer and warmer association  in our home. We came to love those who were responsible for our conversion in a way we had not <span id="page-948"></span> known was possible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“A new bishop probably brought to us what we now needed more - not more strength but the opportunity  for developing ours through service. In addition to attending three Sunday meetings, I began spending considerable time at the church on a remodeling project. The bishop’s challenge in September of 1961 to be ordained an Elder I gratefully  but humbly accepted. I continually felt a gnawing doubt as to my worthiness, however, and looked upon my entering the temple as an impossibility  at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Some two months after my ordination as Elder, as I was enjoying a fast and testimony meeting  in a rather detached way, an incident occurred that completely shattered my composure. Our oldest daughter, who was shy around adults and had trouble with stuttering when under emotional strain, suddenly stood on her feet. She poured out her love for her Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and for her family; she told of her joy in our activity in the church. Through her tears she uttered a prayer that we as a family could be together in the next world as we were in this. My astonishment was complete, and her sweet spirit and the overpowering presence of the Spirit of the Lord brought a surge of tears to my eyes such as I have never known before. It was as though I had been permitted a glimpse into eternity through the influence of this little girl of ours and it left me completely overwhelmed. I gained a firm conviction  of the influence of testimony that day. The bishop met me outside the chapel that evening and told me it was time I quit fooling around and took my family to the temple. This I did on December 1, 1961. I’ll never forget my joy as the six of us knelt around the altar that evening, my three beautiful  daughters, my fine son, and my lovely wife, all being joined together with me as a family unit for all eternity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After teaching Course 10 in Sunday School for approximately six months, I was called to be Sunday School Superintendent. In the summer of 1963, shortly after his installation a new bishop called me into his office and asked me to be the <span id="page-949"></span> Explorer leader inthe M.I.A. In August of 1964, after having been in exploring nearly one year, my wife and I were able to purchase the home at #3 Douglas St. in which we hope to spend the rest of our lives. Knowing this to be a permanent move we, with the concurrence of our bishop, decided to change our membership to the North 33rd Ward, the ward where we now reside. My wife and children  changed immediately, but I could not bring my- self to leave ‘my boys’ until another year had passed. In late 1965 I took over the explorer post in our home ward.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then came the call to be Bishop of the North 33rd Ward, which was the most humbling experience of my life. Had I not been a firm believer in the principle of divine revelation and inspiration, and a great admirer of our stake leaders, I would have seriously questioned the wisdom of this call. I never face a congregation but what I am overwhelmed  at the tremendous leadership abilities of the men over whom I serve. May the Lord bless me and help me to bring about those purposes for which I was called.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">While Reed got established in his business. Norma worked, first at the University of Utah and later for the Union Pacific Railroad where she started as a vacation relief but soon was on a regular basis. Here she continued her employment most of seventeen years with only time out to have four fine children. Besides, she and Reed have worked ceaselessly together building their home, their business and in church service. Among other responsibilities, Norma served as Relief Society President and is currently serving as President of the Ward Y.W.M.I.A.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The couple and their children are truly “buddies”. They have fun doing things together. They boat, ski - both snow and water - ride horses, camp out, fish, travel, hike, and swim in the family pool. Norma’s mother, Myrtle, has lived with them the majority of the last twelve years and has been a welcome and beloved member of their family group. Their home is a happy rendezvous for relatives, neighbors, friends and members of the Ward, especially the young people. There is <span id="page-950"></span> seldom a dull moment at the Websters.</p>
