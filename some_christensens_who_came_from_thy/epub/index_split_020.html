  <h2 class="calibre9" id="tragedy-on-the-plains">TRAGEDY ON THE PLAINS</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The teams pulled out slowly, traveling a few miles out on the prairie, and encamped the first night on the brow of a hill. A meeting was held at which they were more fully organized for traveling and the necessary officers of tens and fifties appointed, as well as interpreters for the Scandinavians. Next day they traveled westward until nearly noon and then stopped for several hours while provisions were distributed to the passengers for the first time. The rations allowed consisted of 14 pounds of flour and one pound of bacon each day for each adult, besides sugar, molasses, dried fruit and other eatables, all of which they were to prepare and cook themselves to suit their respective tastes. Having never done the like before, some of the emigrants found the baking of bread and cooking of meals in the open air a difficult task; but after a few days practice, most of them learned and life on the plains soon became rather natural, especially for those who were young and hearty. To the older members of the company, and those who had large families of children, the case was usually quite different however. The task of walking as much as possible was enjoined upon every young and able-bodied person, in order to lighten the burden of the animals. Only the old, weak and sickly were privileged to ride to any great extent, and there were plenty of those in this ill-fated company. At noon and night, when camping, was their busiest time. First, they pitched their tents, gathered fuel and fetched water, then they made fires, baked bread, cooked other food, and finally ate their meals around the campfires, sitting on the grass or rocks. Wood was sometimes very scarce along the way and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-197" title="197"></span>in such cases they resorted to the use of dry manure, or “buffalo chips” as this was called. Frequently they had to tramp long distances to get water and sometimes they had to make “dry camp” where there was no water. Often they had to cook their meals while the rain poured down in torrents and drenched them to the skin and put out their fires. At other times the wind blew so hard, lifting up the loose soil and enveloping all in a cloud of dust, that their tents fell and their food was spiced with sand. For these Scandinavians from the land of short distances, this was indeed a new life and at times their energies and patience were taxed to the utmost. They had to learn that there were unavoidable difficulties in crossing the plains; besides, many of them had much more serious things to grieve them for there were many sick and dying among them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In making their camp the usual “Mormon” method of forming two half-circles with the wagons was observed, so that a corral was made into which the oxen would be driven to be caught and yoked up anew each morning. Their tents were pitched outside the enclosure, each tent opposite the wagon to which it belonged. The oxen and such loose stock as they had were herded during the night by special herdsmen who had been brought along for that purpose, but the regular night watch in the camp was taken in turn by the emigrating brethren. Public prayer was offered in camp every night, in which everybody was supposed to participate. After the prayer, the Captain or some other leader generally made remarks of an encouraging and instructive nature, the essence of which was translated into Danish for the benefit of those who didn’t yet understand English.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus the Abner Lowry Pioneer Company traveled from Wyoming, across the prairies of Nebraska, in a northwesterly direction to the Platte River, following the so-called Oregon Trail by way of Fort Kearney to a point near Fort McPherson. From thence they crossed the highland from the South Platte to the North Platte, reaching the latter stream at the mouth of Ash Hollow. From here they went along the North <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-198" title="198"></span>Platte by way of Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff until they reached Fort Laramie. Leaving that Fort they crossed hills and streams until they came to the mouth of Deer Creek, a tributary of the Platte, traveling westward from there to the upper crossing of the Platte, where the Mormon Pioneers of 1847 had built a ferry near the site of the present city of Casper, Wyoming. They crossed the river on a bridge which stood near the old ferry and continued on in a northwesterly direction past Independence Rock and Devils Gate, then followed the Sweetwater River about seventy miles to the Continental Divide. Near this point they left the Oregon Trail and took the Mormon Pioneer trail, until they came to what was known as the “Three Crossings of the Sweetwater”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At several points on the journey they had come in contact with Indians, most of them friendly contrary to what the emigrants had expected. They saw only a few buffalos, for many of these noble animals had been wantonly destroyed by white hunters, thus wasting the food of the Indians, which had made the red men very angry. But while the Sioux Indians and other tribes showed hostilities to travelers generally, they usually distinguished between “Mormon” caravans and others; and while they would steal from most travelers they often left the “Mormon Pioneer Trains” alone. During the early part of their trek the Lowry Company had plenty of food and to spare, but on reaching the mountain country the appetites of all but the sick increased, and yet those in charge were forced to cut down the rations owing to the fact that some of the provisions that had been cached at different points along the way to Wyoming to be used by the company on their return, had been stolen by Indians or renegade whites. Thus many of the more hearty of them suffered for lack of sufficient food and sometimes longed for good square meals again. They generally broke camp about 8 o’clock each morning and traveled from 12 to 20 miles a day, stopping about two hours at noon to cook and feed themselves and animals. The day’s journey was somewhat monotonous at times and most were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-199" title="199"></span>glad to see the wagons drawn up to form a corral, when they could stop and rest their weary feet for a spell. The young people, however, never seemed to tire and were usually bent on having their dancing and lively sports at the day’s end, until the call of the horn summoned all together for song and prayer before retiring. Then dancing and all other music ceased as hundreds of voices were lifted in a hymn of praise. What mattered if they sang in different tongues - the Almighty Father understood all. The hymn finished, utmost quiet would prevail throughout the camp as one of the Elders prepared to offer up a prayer of thanksgiving for the care and guidance given them that day. President Brigham Young had advised his followers to dance, sing and pray, and enjoy themselves together as they crossed the plains. He was wise in wanting them to forget their cares and sorrows as they could. And though these Pioneers rejoiced as each new day brought them nearer to their journey’s end, it is unlikely that many in this company were ever very gay at any time, since the hand of death traveled with them all the way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shortly after the middle of September winter caught up with them as they reached the higher elevations. A terrific wind and snowstorm came down upon them and covered everything. It was difficult to find fuel for their fires or feed for their oxen, some of which became badly frozen, a few almost to the point of disability. Some mornings it was only with much difficulty that the teamsters succeeded in getting the hungry and half frozen animals hitched up and on their way. Capt. Lowry and his associates knew that many more storms like this in the Rockies would prove treacherous, if not disasterous to the weary animals as well as the sick and elderly of the company, if not to all. So the captain sent a telegram to the authorities in Salt Lake City asking that relief be sent them if possible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The identity of most of the emigrants of the Abner Lowry company was lost in the dust of covered wagons as they became just “Mormon Pioneers”. Sometimes a name crops up here and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-200" title="200"></span>there, or an incident is recalled of some who came in that ill-fated wagon-caravan in 1866: Dorthy Madsen of Manti tells of her great grandmother, Christena Roth Jensen of Holstein, Germany, who came with her husband and children on the ship “Cavour”. Her husband, Louis Jensen, a Dane from Copenhagen, died as they followed with the Lowry company along the Sweetwater River in Wyoming Territory, 11 Sep. 1866, and was buried there the next day. Feeling very alone then and hardly knowing what to do, she knelt down and prayed to her Heavenly Father for guidance as to whether to eventually go back to her people in the Old Country or to settle in Zion. At this moment, as she looked up into Heaven, she beheld a bright star in the western sky. This immediately struck her as being an answer to her prayers and she knew then that she must settle in the west. So this brave thirty-five year old mother took her small fatherless children, from five years to nine months old, including twins, and settled in Sanpete Valley at Manti. Utah’s last original pioneer, Hilde Anderson Erickson, who passed away January 1968 at one hundred and eight years of age, came with the Abner Lowry Company across the plains and settled first in Sanpete. Perhaps one of the most pathetic stories of members of the Abner Lowry Company that has yet come to light is the one told by a Swedish Saint who came on the ship “Cavour”. This is how sixteen year old Charles Peter Warnick told it:— “I, together with my parents, Anders Peter and Anna Helena Anderson Warnick, my two brothers, John August and Anders Gustave, my sister Anne Christine, two sisters-in-law and three children, left our native land in the latter part of April 1866. We were thankful that we had thus been blessed of the Lord that we were able to go to Zion where we might live and worship with those of our faith, without fear of mobs or ridicule, But alas! How short sighted are we human beings! We boarded the sailing vessel “Cavour” at Hamburg, June 1st 1866, for our trip across the great Atlantic. The supply of water was very limited for such a long journey, which lasted nine weeks. We were allowed one quart of water per family per day. The water itself was terribly bad. Other rations were<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-201" title="201"></span>likewise limited and of poor quality. Sickness broke out among the passengers. I was so sick my mother worried as to whether I would be allowed to land. But that part went all right and we were glad once more to set foot on Mother Earth and to enjoy the luxury of good cold water, as the weather was warm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When we landed at New York we went directly to Castle Garden and from there to Montreal, Canada. When we saw the string of cars into which we were being herded, our hearts almost failed us. But what could we do about it? We were on the road and must follow it through even though we were treated like cattle, for that was the kind of cars the train was made up of. But those awful hard and dirty cars proved to be a blessing in disguise, for we had not been long on the train when cholera broke out in a very serious form among the people. The poor stricken souls couldn’t have sat up, so with room to spread their bedding down it was better for them. But oh how they suffered with the jarring and bumping of the cars. When we had traveled three days my dear mother passed away, on the fifth of August, she being one of the first to go. Her body was left on the station platform at Marcella. Conditions continued to get worse and when we reached St. Joseph a few days later, my father and sister Christine were left dying on the platform. When I look back and think of that awful scene I wonder how we could do it, and I can only think that we saw so much suffering and death that our sense of feeling and sympathy must have been paralyzed. We thought that we were all doomed and nothing mattered - the sooner the better.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We met ox teams at Wyoming, Nebraska and started for Salt Lake City on August 13th. The company we traveled with was made up of teams and men from Sanpete County. Our Captain’s name was Abner Lowry and he was from Manti. But the angel of death had not finished his work; many of our companions were left in shallow graves by the roadside. One noon, as we were camping, all the men that were able were busy digging one large grave in which seven bodies were buried. We had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-202" title="202"></span>not been out many days when my brother Anders Gustave said to me, ‘Let us pray for we don’t know how soon our turn will come.’ How true he spoke, for it was only two days later when he passed away and it was only a few days after that when his betrothed, Charlotte Bengsten, died; also one of my brother August’s children and a little girl of my dead sister Christine. Before we reached our journey’s end another of August’s children died, making eight of our number who passed away on this terrible journey. I remember especially one whole family that died and in many instances there were just one or two left of large families. This was the darkest chapter in my life, but yet in this great suffering and bereavement we knew they died in the faith and in hopes of reaching a better land. Our family was now just John, August and his wife, Mary Bengsten Warnick, their little girl Caroline, and myself. Their baby, born on the plains, was numbered among the dead. I was then sixteen years old.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of course it was not unusual for pioneers to die on their way to the Valleys of the Mountains - but whole families, how sad that was! In the three companies of mostly Scandinavians that preceded Capt. Abner Lowry’s, numbers failed to reach their destinations; ten persons having died in Capt. Rawling’s company, close to thirty in Capt. Nebeker’s and about the same in Capt, Scott’s. But the toll was much greater in this last of the Church trains of 1866. The death rate, mostly from cholera, was extremely high, the rough estimate is at least fifty, but no one really knows just how many among this ill-fated company battled for their lives with that terrible malady - and lost.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Autumn’s heat upon dry desert plains - parched lips - chapped and bleeding hands; sharp rocks and prickly thistles - torn, burning, blistered feet; tugging, sweating ox and grinding wheels of overloaded wagons - sting of dust in eyes and nostrils; fevered brows - dysentery from which so many suffered - swarming flies and gnats - these were but a few of the “little things” that vexed and annoyed them - these emigrant pioneers. These could in no way compare with their greater burdens - the never <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-203" title="203"></span>ending, poignant yearning for home, salt spray or sound of sea, or the far deeper pain of grief and longing for loved ones who would never return. And so at nights on the plains, under the impersonal, remote stars, many from the lands of sea-washed kingdoms could not sleep, but lay and moaned for things that would not-leave them, quite alone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What part the Christensens from Thy played in this tragic drama in the wilderness is little known since few details of their trek have filtered down to their posterity. We know that at least the adults of the group walked most of the way. They were not city-bred, like some, but country folk from the harshest part of Jutland, strong and vigorous people in the main. Thus the wearisome journey must have perhaps proved less exacting for them physically than for numbers of others in the same company. It has been said that this long hard journey brought about, by natural processes, a selection of the strong in body, mind or spirit; for, as has further been stated, — “The cowards never started and the weak died on the way.” Who can say? We fully believe, however, that our Christensens were among those who helped the less fortunate along the way. At least this was the case with one particular emigrant family of which we have been told. Christen Christensen had paid the fare of Hans Jensen and his wife and three children from Jutland. He thought so much of this young family and was most sorrowful when both the father and the mother died of cholera on the plains, He arranged to take care of the orphan children the remainder of the journey. Did his fatherly and generous nature, and the sympathetic and understanding character of the other members of his party, send them to the aid of others of the distressed in whatever capacities they could serve? We think so. Surely all of them must have gathered at many gravesides on the plains, to offer help and comfort to the bereaved during the bleak, anguished burials of their dead. The Christensens and Myrups knew the value of sympathy, for they themselves were well acquainted with the sorrow of a dear one’s passing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Andrew Jenson wrote: this of the Abner Lowry <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-204" title="204"></span>Company:— “If the details of this company’s journey across the plains were written, it would probably present one of the most pitiable and heartrending chapters in the history of the Church; but it is perhaps better to close the episode and not revive the memory of something so touching and sorrowful. At some future date, undoubtedly, more details will be published about the experience of that ill-fated company; and in the great hereafter those who laid down their lives on the way will have an opportunity to give an accurate and truthful account of their sufferings.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Sept. 27th, the Abner Lowry company was met at the Three Crossings of the Sweetwater by Capt. Arza Hinkley’s relief train which had been sent out from Salt Lake City some 450 miles to help these belated emigrants continue on. Taking the sick and aged aboard, this mule train headed west again and arrived in Salt Lake on Sun. Oct. 7th, two weeks before the main Lowry company. According to historian Jenson, this relief train was the last of the Church trains sent out to bring the poor to Zion that year of 1866. In all, these were made up of some 10 captains, 456 teamsters, 49 mounted guards, 89 horses, 195 mules, 3,092 oxen and 459 wagons, the largest part of which traveled all the way to Wyoming, Nebraska and back. A church that cared this much for the lives of these poor emigrants would not be inclined to abandon them when they joined the body of the Saints in their “Promised Land”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Much heartened and their loads lightened, the remaining emigrants continued their travels along the Mormon Trail. Since they encountered more severe snowstorms during some of the rest of the journey, the mortality among them would likely have been much higher had they not received this aid from Captain Hinkley’s relief train. At South Pass this telegram was sent to the authorities in Salt Lake City: “South Pass, Oct. 3. We camped here last night - all well - Ab Lowry”. From there the company crossed Little Sandy, Big Sandy, Green River, Hams Fork, and Black Fork to Fort Bridger, where the captain sent another telegram to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-205" title="205"></span>brethren; — “Bridger, Wyo. Oct, 11 We camp tonight on the Muddy - Ab Lowry”. A well beaten road led them from the Muddy River by way of Bear River, Yellow Creek, etc., to the mouth of Echo Canyon, thence up along the Weber River ten miles via the present sites of Coalville, Hoytsville and Wanship, buffeting storms and cold most of the way. Next their route led them through Silver Creek Canyon, Parleys Park, and then over the mountain and through Parleys Canyon, at the mouth of which they entered Great Salt Lake Valley. Here the mountains no longer came together to close the view and by climbing up to a bluff, a short distance above where the old Utah penitentiary later stood, they could see Salt Lake City in the distance, northwest, “How beautiful - how grand!” was shouted back by those who ascended to behold with rapture the “City of the Saints!” — the place they had all dreamed of, and prayed and hoped so long to see. Ja, Ja; here it was at last - their Zion - their Promised Land!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With mounting excitement the company continued down the mountain pass and on over the area now called Sugar House; then crossing the State road, they entered the Church farm where they camped for the night. The next morning, which was Mon, Oct, 22, 1866, all were eager to fix themselves up before taking to the road again, so it was approaching noon before they had driven the additional four miles northward and entered the Church Tithing Office yard in the heart of Great Salt Lake City. Here they were expected, for word had gone ahead, and there was quite a crowd of welcomers to greet them. Some of the Scandinavians who had preceded them in the three earlier companies were there, and some seeking to claim the many orphans. Saints who were lucky enough to have friends or kinfolk already living in the vicinity were met by these, and the vanguard of their company, the sick, most of them recovered, and the elderly - were there also. There was an abundance of joy and thanksgiving manifested on all sides - but undertones of sorrow too, for those who were expected and never came.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-206" title="206"></span>There must have been a number to welcome the Christensens from Jutland - newly made friends of the “Kenilworth” - old friends who had come before. Can we imagine the thrill of it, as long lost friends embraced and passed on the news and greetings from the Old Country in their harsh Jutlandic Danish brogue? A great spirit of brotherhood had grown up among these Latter-day Saints; bonds of friendship had been forged which were to last to the end of living - and who was there to say they would not last for aye? Time moves so quickly. It had been more than six months since these friendly folks had left their home in Kobberø, near the beautiful Limfjord; yet here they were in Zion with snow-capped mountains surrounded - all but the gentle Karen. Soon the bitter heartbreak of the past would vanish like a dream and they would begin to build new homes and sink their roots in the valleys of the mountains.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those of us living today who might have driven up Emigration Canyon to the summit of the present highway, then turned right and followed a side road briefly to the top of Little Mountain, just as a giant moon came looming over the Wasatch peaks to the east, and turned to look down on Parleys Canyon road, would have seen a queue of lights from swiftly moving autos, twinkling like a tiny chain of crystal stars. And then, if we had turned around and gazed over the canyon’s mountain tops towards Salt Lake Valley, we would have seen the night-glow of the great city which the Saints planted there. None of us can imagine the work and energy that went into the building of Salt Lake City and its suburbs - or any other city, town or village in Utah for that matter - without a sense of awe and wonder. From the very first settlers wearily trooping onto the hot, dry desert floor, and the thousands following and building, the cost in effort and sacrifice is immeasurable. There was no easy road for our pioneer progenitors. No one with values can think on these things from high on top a mountain, where air and reason are clear and cool, without sensing that people with outstanding faith and great courage toiled to leave us this marvelous legacy. These noble predecessors of ours built a mighty empire because they themselves<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-207" title="207"></span>were mighty - in brain and brawn - in courage, valour and honesty! They cared little for what lesser souls thought and said of them. We enjoy the fruits of their building today and we ought to be glad and thankful for it. President Heber J. Grant once said, — “Dream, young man - dream nobly and manfully - and your dreams will be your prophets”. We have been given a heritage bought by noble dreams.</p>
