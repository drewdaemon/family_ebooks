  <p class="calibre1">Elsie, the first daughter born to Laurs and Else Christensen and the first of the three children born to them in Mayfield, first saw the light 8 Mar. 1875. A twin sister arrived shortly after and since there was some question as to whether either of the tiny girls would survive they were each blessed and given names right away. The twin sister was given the name Mary Karen, by her father Laurs, but she was usually referred to after that as “Karrie”. She died shortly after she was named and blessed. The early Gunnison Ward records show that Elsie was blessed and named that day by W. N. Tofte and given the same name as her mother had been christened, Else Cathrine, but her name spelling was later modernized to Elsie Kathrine.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie was born in a log cabin in North Mayfield while her parents were members of the United Order there. She was past two when they left the Order and went to live in South Mayfield. She was just past four when her mother left the family in Mayfield with her father and a Mrs. Anderson in charge and went to Salt Lake City to study medicine. The year after (1880), when Elsie was just past five, the family moved back to Gunnison where they had lived before coming to Mayfield, but they spent the next several summers in Christenburg where her father leased a farm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Her parents built a new rock house on property they purchased in northwest Gunnison and here Elsie lived most of the rest of her life until she was married. It was from here that she went to the Sanpitch River to be baptized a member of the L.D.S. Church, 2 July 1884, by Jens Jensen. It was here that she went to the church nearby the day after, 3 July 1884, and was confirmed by Jens Larsen, and it was from here that she went to receive a patriarchal blessing from Christian August Madsen, former Gunnison Bishop, on 15 Apr. 1901, not long before her marriage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie started school in Gunnison the year she was six and the school was held not far from their</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-579"></span> rock house. We are fortunate to be able to copy much of the remainder of her history from her own record, which she placed in her “Book of Remembrance”. We quote from this:— “One thing I remember when I started school in Gunnison, Augusta Swalberg, my teacher, made me stand up by her table for talking. I cried so loud she couldn’t go on with her teaching so she told me to go to my seat. In my first two years.of school I had learned my readers so that I could recite them through by memory. The next three years spelling, reading and arithmetic were taught. Ward Stevens was the teacher. The time I liked best was during recess when Emma Metcalf and I played baseball with the big boys, one of us on each side. We were good batters and fast on the run. On Fourth of July I took part in a running contest; as first prize I received a beautiful blue feather fan.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At the age of fourteen I went to the Snow Academy in Ephraim, Sanpete, Utah, which had been founded the year before (5 Nov. 1888). The upstairs of the old Co-op Store there was the residence of the institution. Alma Greenwood was then its president and he was assisted by a Miss Henry. The Academy was just a preparatory and intermediate school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The fall of the next year (1890) I kept house for my father while mother and a foster child, Ada, went to Denmark to visit her folks. After they returned home I attended the Seminary held in Gunnison Ward and taught by Brother Joseph Jensen. This I started in January 1891. That fall I went to Provo with my brothers Joseph and Albert and Vio Sorenson to attend the Brigham Young Academy. Vio’s grandmother, Sister Capson, kept house for us. The school was held in the Z.C.M.I. warehouse near the depot, which was the best that could be had at the time. But on Monday, 4 Jan. 1892, teachers and students marched to the new building for the B.Y.A. between 5th and 6th North on Academy Ave. The veteran educator, Karl G. Maeser, was released as president of the school and Benjamin Cluff installed as his successor. I continued school in winters at B.Y.A. until 21 May 1896, when I was <span id="page-580"></span> graduated from that institution and received the degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy. My diploma was signed by Nelson Duesenberry, President of the School Board, and Benjamin Cluff, President of the Academy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My first year of teaching school was at Hinckley, Millard Co., Utah. The next two years I taught at Centerfield, next to Gunnison. In the winter of 1899/1900 I returned to B.Y.A. again, at Provo, to further my education in literature, taught by Alice Louise Reynolds; music, piano and harmony under A. C. Lund; and religion taught by George Reynolds, with special lectures on the Bible and Book of Mormon given by Dr. Whitney of Salt Lake City. While attending B.Y.A. at this time I taught a class in Sunday School in the Ward in which I lived and Emma Lucy Gates, who later became famous as a singer, was in my class. Miss Susan Talmage and I were counselors to Mrs. Snow in M.I.A. that same year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The fall of 1900 I returned to teach school in Centerfield again until May 1901. Then on 26 June 1901 I was married to Alma C. Bartholomew of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah in the Manti Temple by Temple President John D. T. McAllister. That evening my parents gave us a very elaborate wedding reception in their home in Gunnison. There were one hundred invited guests, including four Bishops, and a big supper was served to all, as was the custom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next day we went to Fayette and lived with my husband’s folks for nearly a year. Our first son, Alma Owen, was born in an upstairs bedroom of their home, 1 May 1902, both grandmothers being in attendance, my mother Else as midwife and Alma’s mother Eliza to care for our needs. We moved from there to a Mellor house, where our second son, Edgar, was born 20 Aug. 1903. Then we bought and remodeled the Brown house in Fayette and here our next two sons were born, Byard 2 Mar. 1905 and Clifton 24 Nov. 1906.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In June 1907, when Clifton was just past six months old, we bought a beautiful new red brick home in Gunnison from Lafe Bown - and here we</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-581"></span> settled.” Sorrow caught up with Elsie’s and Alma’s family when on 18 Dec. 1909 their beautiful little son, Byard, passed away. He lacked less than three months of being five years old. Byard had never had a strong heart and though everything they could do had been done for him, he did not survive. Elsie and her mother were alone with the child when death came for him; Alma was on the desert with the sheep. (A more detailed account of Byard’s death is given earlier in the book.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two daughters were born to Elsie and Alma in the new red brick home in Gunnison; Edith 10 Feb. 1910, less than two months after little Byard’s death, and Ella May 10 May 1912. Elsie continues with her history:— “I have always had great faith in prayer and the Lord has helped me so many times when I have been sick or in trouble. One such incident stands out in my mind. After Ellamae (or Ella May) was born there were many months when I felt poorly. When she was three years old I went to Dr. Olsten in Manti, a specialist in women’s diseases. I was told that I had a cancerous condition. I had to visit him three times a week for three months, going from Gunnison to Manti and back for these treatments. (This was the early part of the winter of 1915/16). On these days each week, after I had sent my boys off to school, I started with my two little girls in a one-horse open buggy for Manti. We had mittens, hoods, hot irons at our feet and a lap robe to cover us. One day it began snowing soon after we started so we were well covered with the wet snow when we reached my parents’ home in Manti. Father was there to take care of the horse. Mother took the girls and had a hot lunch prepared for us. Then I went for my treatment. When I came into the doctor’s office he took me by the shoulders and said, ‘Woman, woman; you have the faith to remove mountains! If Mrs. Andersen had half the faith you have, she could get well too.’ (Mrs. Andersen was a cousin of mine and was being treated by Dr. Olsten for the same trouble as I - she did not get well). I answered, ‘I must get well, I have little ones that need me!’ (That was over forty years ago and here I am 81, I have been <span id="page-582"></span> made well many times by faith, prayer and works - ‘Praise God from whom all blessings flow…’)”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Troubles sometimes come in pairs or more and this was a very difficult winter for Elsie. Besides her worrisome illness, she and her husband had had a serious misunderstanding. Elsie was a very proud woman and this must have been very difficult for her to bear. Alma continued to stay away with the sheep and Elsie struggled with her problems alone. But she was not of pure blooded Danish extraction for nothing - her determination (some call it stubbornness) knew no bounds. Besides, as she has stated, she had much faith in prayer. She continues with her own history:— “We sold our lovely home to my brother Arthur Christensen and took his old home, which had once belonged to brother Chris, in on the deal. Here the children and I moved the latter part of 1915 - Alma was with the sheep.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 27 Mar. 1916 the children and I and my brother Lou’s family left Gunnison by train headed for Lyman, Wyoming. The night before we all stayed at my sister Emma’s, since she only lived about a mile from the depot. We took up a homestead about six miles east of Lyman, Wyoming, rather close to a ranch owned by my brother Chris. Lou also took up homestead land there and my brother Andrew and Chris’ daughter Pearl, and later my sister Elvena, making about 2,320 acres in all which we called ‘The Oasis’. The children and I worked hard clearing the sagebrush, doing some planting of crops and garden and making the necessary improvements to prove up on our homestead property for two difficult summers. In winters we rented a place in Lyman, Wyoming and moved into town so the children could go to school.” A story is told about Elsie when she was living in Lyman. She was herding her cows as they grazed on the ditch bank not far from her home there, taking particular pains to avoid the mud puddles left by a recent storm. Some people drove up to her place in a buggy - she wasn’t expecting company. She strained her eyes in their direction and suddenly she recognized that it was her brother Arthur and his wife Millie. In her joy she plowed <span id="page-583"></span> right through the mud puddles in her haste to greet them, which she did with hugs and kisses but with wet, muddy shoes and skirt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the end of two years of struggle in Wyoming, during which time “firebugs” had threatened to drive them from their homestead, crops had been burned belonging to her brother Chris, her brother Lou’s house had been set on fire, and Chris himself had finally lost his life there. Elsie had met the terms of the homestead act and the place was hers. Many a time during that period she had stood with a gun at nights guarding her log house on “The Oasis”, and her young sons had stood guard beside her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometime in the interim, or at least by the end of those two desperate years, Elsie and Alma effected a reconciliation. Elsie and the children joined Alma in Ogden, Utah, the spring of 1918 and the family were reunited. They lived in Ogden until the following spring, the children attending school there that winter, and then returned together to Lyman, Wyoming for another year, at the request of the children. Elsie continues her story: “In the spring of 1920 we moved to Goshen, Utah and rented the Robert Boswell farm there. In the four-roomed adobe farm house on this place our third daughter and last child, LaPreal, was born, 8 Feb. 1921.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Alma and our oldest son, A. Owen, obtained employment at the Tintic Standard Mine carpenter shop in Dividend, Alma first and A. Owen later, and so we moved into the town of Goshen, renting the John Morgan home for a short time and then moving into a larger house there owned by Hazel Done. I became active in the Goshen Ward, enjoying the work very much. For some time I was in the presidency of the Relief Society. I was called to sing in duets and choruses on many occasions, was a class leader in the Relief Society most of my time there and taught the adult class in Sunday School. I loved the people there and in turn had many friends.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1931 we moved to Payson, Utah, where we had just finished building a new brick house at 369 North 3rd East. (This lovely <span id="page-584"></span> home Elsie lived in the rest of her days in Payson.) We had not gotten settled when Mrs. Bona, Relief Society President in our new Payson Ward, called at our home and asked me to be the Literary class teacher for that organization. I held that position for two years and then was asked to be the Theology class leader, which position I accepted and filled for eight or ten years. My health then became poor (she suffered from a heart ailment), and I was released from all responsibility at that time. When I became stronger I taught the Literary lessons for another year. On 4 June 1952 I was set apart as a visiting teacher in the Relief Society by Brother Harold Rasmusson of Payson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I joined the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers (D.U.P.) in 1934, Payson Camp 1. I was elected chorister of this organization 19 May 1940, Regis- trar 19 May 1945 and chosen Parliamentarian in 1948. I was sent as a delegate to the County con- vention and was elected second vice captain and class leader, which position I held until March 1956. I have also been a Sunday School teacher in the Old Testament department during these Payson years.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie’s husband, Alma, was set apart as Bishop of their Payson Fourth Ward 13 Jan. 1952, and served a full two years before being forced to be released because of poor health. Though he was three and a half years younger than Elsie, yet he was more frail and had suffered from ulcers for many years. He passed away in a Payson hospital following surgery, 6 Mar. 1954. After his death Elsie continued to live on in their comfortable home in Payson. Her unmarried son, Edgar, was there with her when he could be and helped support her in all ways - in fact he was wonderful to her! Her oldest son, A. Owen, and family lived right next door and kept an eye on her also, until it became necessary for her to have someone with her much of the time. Finally she went to live with Edith, her oldest daughter, in her home in Provo. Edith, a Ph D in the department of advanced education at Brigham Young University, was of necessity away from home a great deal but she had a girl with her mother when she herself could not be there. <span id="page-585"></span> She was a loving, thoughtful and attentive daughter and Elsie seemed happy in her home. She gave her the very best of care.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie loved to travel and her children often included her on trips they took. She recorded an account of some of these travels in her history:— “I have visited numbers of places with members of my family: Mirror Lake with Edith, Heber and Co., Yellowstone Park with Ellamae and H. D. Krantz (before they were married), Grand Canyon with Edith and her husband, little Helen and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Mark Sabin and daughters - such a happy, congenial group, and the canyon was so beautiful and stupendous I was led to exclaim, ‘Lo, what hath God wrought?’ Yellowstone Park was also wonderful in its own way, a scenic diadem in the midst of a beautiful, natural mountain landscape with its water fountains, geysers, myriad cascades and waterfalls. All were breathtaking, but the sizzling eruptions of steam and hot water from the geysers were frightening.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had a pleasant trip to California one June, again with the Bauers and Heber’s brother and mother. We stopped at Lake Tahoe, which had the bluest water I had ever seen; crossed the Sierra Nevadas to Sacramento and ferried from Oakland to San Francisco. The fog here was thick and cold and we had a hard time finding an apartment that night - everything was cold and wet. But the sun was bright next morning and we saw Twin Peaks, the Zoo, Seal Rock, Pasadena, fish wharves, yacht docks, and in the evening visited China Town. We left for Yosemite Park, where the deer were tame as young calves and trees ages old. We visited Palo Alto and Stanford University grounds; saw Herbert Hoover’s home and surroundings; had lunch at Mercede; saw ‘fire fall’ and the feeding of the bears at Old Village; went to Mirror Lake, Happy Isle, Alcapetan, around the loop to the south entrance and saw the giant Redwoods. From here we missed a road sign and had a hot, dusty ride over a cow trail for about fifty miles. We ate lunch at Fresno and spent the night at San Fernando. We went through orange groves. and bought seven dozen oranges for 20¢; went to <span id="page-586"></span> San Diego and got an apartment and then went over into Mexico (Tijuana and Caliente); then went back to San Diego and through the Exposition there, where we did a bit of shopping. Leaving San Diego we went to Wilmington, then tock a boat to Catalina Island and rode in a glass-bottom boat. We visited the Casino, St. Kathrine Hotel, and strolled along the boardwalk, disgusted with the scant attire of men and women. Going back to Wilmington by boat, we started for home. It had been a wonderful and new experience. Heber, Edith, mother Bauer, Heber’s cousin Dean Carl Bauer, LaPreal and myself all took the trip in Heber’s car and all returned home safely and well.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In April of 1957 Elsie took another trip with her daughter Ellamae and husband (H. D. Krantz) to pick up a grandson, William C. Krantz (Bill) who had just been released after serving a mission for the LDS church. Ellamae writes of this:— “Mother went with us when we went to Mexico to pick Bill up. The western part of Mexico is rather isolated from the eastern part, being separated by the Sierra Madre mountains. Bill was to be officially released in Monterey and as we had only ten days we decided to drive the shortest road to Monterey - from Mazatlan to Durango. It took from 9 a.m. until midnight and was only 150 miles. It was a narrow dirt road, actually only used by trucks for transporting goods. We switched back and forth to the top of a mountain and then there were more mountains as far as the eye could see.” Elsie was just past eighty-two when she took this strenuous trip but she enjoyed it. Her last long trip by automobile was when she went with Edith to spend the Christmas holidays in Texas with Edith’s daughter Helen and family, when she was eighty-seven.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In her later years Elsie became interested in genealogy. She took courses in the study of this subject for which she received certificates, She organized and put together a very fine “Book of Remembrance” in which she included a history of herself and Alma, as well as one of each of their seven children. She also wrote histories of both her father and mother and of her Danish grandfather, <span id="page-587"></span> Christen Christensen. Genealogy was a subject the church had begun stressing more and more during her later years, and being always anxious to follow the counsels of the church to the best of her ability, she worked at genealogy during the rest of her fruitful years. No one could doubt the love and devotion that Elsie had for the Gospel and the church throughout all the days of her life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I was fortunate enough to be invited by Edith to Aunt Elsie’s eighty-eighth birthday dinner. She had been ill but was feeling much better. A. Owen and Pate were there and Edith’s daughter Helen and her young daughter Helen, as well as Edith and myself. When I first came into Edith’s home, I stooped to kiss Aunt Elsie and said to her, “Do you know who I am?” “Why of course”, she said, “Virginia, I shall always know you. We look so much alike, don’t you think?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finally it became necessary for Elsie to have more care than Edith was free to give her, so she was placed for a short time in the Eldred Hospital in south Provo, where her children could visit her often. Edith went by plane to Hawaii to meet her son Boyd, who was enroute from a two and a half year mission in Taiwan China. The two had gotten as far as LaPreal’s home in California when word reached them of Elsie’s death, 28 June 1964. The death was very sudden and unexpected. Edgar had visited their mother the night before at Eldreds and found her in good spirits and in seemingly good health.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie was eighty-nine years three months and twenty-one days old when she passed away, the last of all the Christensens to depart, except two sisters-in-law - Andrew’s wife Sarah, who lived to be eighty-nine years seven months and fifteen days and died 23 April 1966 just less than two years after, and Albert’s second wife Myrtle, who is still living at this writing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A fine funeral was held in Payson on July 1, 1964. Burial was in the Payson Cemetery and Elsie was placed there beside Alma. Her six surviving children were in attendance. Among others, cousins Pearl and LaFaun and I met with <span id="page-588"></span> the family after all last rites had been spoken. The Payson home, so long a part of Elsie’s life, was the scene of the meeting, for it had been kept by the family until this parting. Everywhere I looked I imagined I could see her, as I had seen her there so many times before engaged in her labors of love. I’m sure her spirit was there then, still watching and praying over her children, as she had always done as long as she was able.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Alma “C” Bartholomew, husband of Elsie, was born 10 Oct. 1878 at Fayette, Sanpete, Utah, the fifth of eleven children born to John Bartholomew and Eliza Roxie Metcalf. Alma was blessed and named by John Mellor, 10 Nov. 1878; baptized by his father, Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Nov. 1887; confirmed the same day by John Mellor; ordained a Deacon by his father 18 Jan. 1892; ordained a Teacher in the priesthood by John James, 23 Jan. 1898; ordained a Priest by Joseph Bartholomew 10 Feb. 1901; and ordained an Elder by his father, 23 June 1901; all of the above taking place in Fayette. The main part of this history of Alma, which follows, was written by Elsie in her Book of Remembrance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Alma was reared in a Bishop’s home and taught the gospel by example as well as precept. His father, Bishop John Bartholomew, was very devout and consistant in living his religion - it was ‘Come, let us go to our meetings and worship the Lord as all our Father’s children should do’. Alma was regular in his attendance at Primary, Sunday School and Sacrament meetings. He was especially grateful to his grandmother Polly Benson (Bartholomew), daughter of Benjamin Benson of early Church history days, who enjoyed so much gathering her grandchildren around her and telling faith-promoting stories about the Prophet Joseph Smith and the trials of the Saints of those early days. She related how she often sat on the Prophet’s knee as a little girl and told of the love he had for little children. Alma was so impressed that there came to be no doubt in his mind but that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. At an early period in his life he <span id="page-589"></span> developed an implicit faith in the power of prayer and felt that he knew his Heavenly Father would answer the prayers of those who asked in faith. He said, ‘In my childish way I prayed about little things that would have seemed foolish to some but were a joy to me because I felt that I was being heard and my little prayers answered.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“His father was a farmer and a stockman and did some carpenter work, especially in the winter. As a young man he had had an accident and had his right knee thrown out of place, which proved to be a handicap to him the rest of his life. Alma, being the oldest boy at home much of the time, had most of the responsibility and care of the stock, such as driving them to the range and gathering them in the fall. He learned to know each by name.” Alma tells of some incidents which stood out in his memory:— “In the month of August when I was thirteen, another milch cow was needed so it was decided that I should go to the summer range and get ‘Old Spotty’ as they were sure she had freshened by that time. The day I was to go, mother was up before daylight to prepare my breakfast and lunch, as it would be a long hard day for me. I was up as soon as I heard mother in the kitchen. Father got Prince, my favorite pony, saddled and a feed of oats for his lunch securely tied to the saddle. Father gave me my instructions and mother kissed me goodbye and her last words were, ‘God bless and protect you dear.’ I was soon merrily on my way and in about two hours was in the canyon where the cattle were. As father had directed, I went to all the water holes - but without success. I stopped at one of the springs long enough to eat lunch and rest my pony and feed him his oats. About four o’clock in the afternoon, as near as I could guess, I had been to every place I thought the cow could be. So I decided I had better start for home if I expected to be there by dark. I traveled two or three miles towards home with a sad feeling, knowing how unhappy mother would be that I had failed. I had a feeling that my Heavenly Father could help me if I would ask him. So I stopped my horse and tied him to a tree and went a little distance down under a pine tree, and prayed for help. As I finished my humble prayer an impression <span id="page-590"></span> came to me that if I would go back to Maple Spring I would find Old Spotty there. I had been there earlier in the day and failed to find her, but I mounted my pony again anyway and rode back hurridly about two miles towards Maple Springs. Before I got to the Spring I saw Old Spotty and it seemed she was waiting for me. I started her on the way home and she walked as fast as she could, but it was dark long before we got out of the canyon. Mother came to meet me when she heard me coming and she was so happy for my safe return and accomplishment. When I told her my story she was happier still, for the goodness of the Lord to me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In September that same year my younger brother and I went with father into the canyon to get some logs for lumber. It was a long day and almost dark when we got to our destination. But father was well acquainted with the canyon and had a camping place in mind. Wood was plentiful and my brother and I soon had a large pile gathered and we soon got a campfire going, hobbled the horses out and cut some pine boughs to sleep on. After prayers we were soon in bed and fast asleep. About midnight the wind began to blow very hard and father said later that in the midst of his slumbers it was as if some invisible force had raised him up by one arm and told him to move quickly. He grabbed us boys and hustled us some distance then hurridly rolled up our bedding and moved that and the grub box and other camping equipment. It seemed but a moment after everything was out of danger that a huge dry log came crashing down across the pine boughs where we had all been in peaceful slumber. It would have been death for us had we not moved. Father often related this circumstance to show the power of prayer. He never neglected his prayers no matter where he happened to be. We got the logs out and to the mill, had them sawed into lumber and were home by the end of the week, grateful for the preservation of our lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When I was ordained a Deacon I soon became quorum president,” wrote Alma. “This gave me an opportunity to become better acquainted with its members. I endeavored to do my duty whatever <span id="page-591"></span> the call was. I had many faith promoting experiences in the Aaronic Priesthood. I was ordained an Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood and not long afterwards, 26 June 1901, I received my endowments in the Manti Temple and was married to Elsie Kathrine Christensen by John D. T. McAllister who was then president of that temple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We settled in Fayette for several years where our first four sons were born. Father and I farmed together. I sold out my interests there and purchased a new home from Lafe Bown in Gunnison in the spring of 1907. At this time I became interested in the sheep business. This work took me away from home much of the time and I became careless in my church duties. I felt I did not have time to work in the church. Through this carelessness I became indifferent. Before long reverses came.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alma’s subsequent separation from his family has been mentioned in Elsie’s history. Alma was working for the Lindsey Land and Livestock Company in southern Utah during this time. He gave up the sheep business to rejoin his family in the spring of 1918. They settled in Goshen the spring of 1920 and Alma farmed there for a couple of years and then worked for Allen’s Market. It was almost like starting from the beginning. Finally he got a job working for the Tintic Standard Mining Co. as “timber shopman”.
