  <p class="calibre1">(54) Margaret Christensen (2) youngest of the children in this branch of the family, was born 27 May 1919 in Hinckley, Millard, Utah. Gleanings from her life’s history have been gathered mostly from her brothers and sisters, although she herself has contributed a few choice glimpses of her early years, She writes: “My Papa was one of the grandest persons I have ever known. He loved us children but always expected us to be well mannered and respectful. He could be stern when he had to be, but he could also be jolly and fun to be with. During the few short years that I was privileged to know him he furnished me with some of my most vivid and cherished memories and most valued lessons of my childhood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“‘Papa’ was the title which Father wished to be called by his younger children. My friends all called their fathers ‘Daddy’ and often teased me for using such an old fashioned name as ‘Papa’. <span id="page-905"></span> Like all children I wanted to be just like one of the crowd and conform, so the next time I saw Father IT addressed him as ‘Daddy’. He was very hurt and felt that I was being disrespectful. He felt that this was a slang expression and that was something he couldn’t tolerate, From then on I always called him Papa and was proud to do so, .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father would many times share his dreams with us younger children as to what was in store for us as soon as ‘the big deal went through’. One of these dreams resulted in my learning a very good lesson. After he had returned from one of his very frequent trips to Southern California, I heard Father telling Mother that we would be moving to California in the very near future. This seemed to be a culmination of many of my own dreams and I just had to share it with my friends. The next morning, in my second grade class, I stood up and made the startling announcement that our family would be moving shortly. As a result a surprise party was planned for me. I was permitted to have the party, but along with it came a stiff punishment for ever having told such a preposterous stretch of the truth. As far as I know Papa was never to know about this - he had already left on one of his trips. I learned then that dreams didn’t too often or too easily come true.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One spring morning Father announced he had decided that Lucile and I were to accompany him to Southern California. Mother was not too much in favor of this because it meant our being taken out of school. Papa had often said that he felt as much could be learned by traveling to new places and observing new things as could be learned in the classroom; so Mother’s veto was soon outvoted by the three of us and we were soon on our way. How thrilled we were! Just think two whole weeks with Papa and no schoolwork or household chores. We could hardly believe our good fortune. Father kept us interested and amused all the way telling us wonderful stories and tales of his various adventures. This was Papa at his best. He loved the out-of-doors and loved traveling. <span id="page-906"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In those days, after leaving St. George, Utah, the road to California resembled a cow trail more than it did a highway. We always crossed the desert at night well supplied with gas and water. Many times during the night Papa awakened Lucile and me to help push the car through the sand that had drifted over the road. Even this did not dampen our spirits. To us this was high adventure. During the night we crossed Dry Lake, a large expanse of dried mud where one could travel at the break-neck speed of thirty or forty miles an hour. As we came to the edge of the desert it was dawn and there was the most beautiful sunrise. We found a quiet spot under a stately Joshua tree and Papa cooked a most delicious breakfast. The memory of the joy of that morning has never faded. We proceeded to our destination where we spent a most enjoyable week in the mountains. From then on traveling was in my blood!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Margaret was just short of eleven and a half years old when her father died. She and Lucile were the only ones of the children left at home with their mother at the time. Some time afterwards the three of them went to live with the older daughter of the family, Edythe Robbins, an arrangement to benefit both families having been worked out. Though Lucile did not remain long at the Robbins’ Margaret and her mother did. In fact this became Margaret’s home until she married.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Margaret’s schooling was all obtained in Salt Lake City. She graduated from South Side High School in 1936. She attended the University of Utah the winter of 1936/37 and the next fall began her nurses training at the LDS Hospital, where she graduated in June 1940 with her R.N. degree, after which she continued to work at the hospital.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She was married 20 Dec. 1940 in the Salt Lake Temple to Richard Paul Adams (b. 10 May 1918 in Salt Lake City to Paul and Florence Eatough Adams). Paul had attended West Side High School where he was an outstanding scholar and achieved in sports. He was in pre-med at the University of Utah at the time of their marriage and continued on until he had spent two years and two quarters in pursuit of <span id="page-907"></span> his medical education at that school. Margaret also continued to work as a nurse at the LDS Hospital after their marriage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the fall of 1941 the couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky where Paul continued his training at the Louisville Medical College while Margaret worked for eight months in surgery at the Norton Memorial Infirmary and then as supervisor of surgery in a children’s hospital in Louisville. She became pregnant so discontinued her hospital work but found employment with the telephone co. there as operator and night supervisor, which was much less taxing. She was determined to see her husband through to his graduation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The couple’s first child, Richard Paul Jr. (Ricky), was born in Louisville in January 1944. Margaret took three months off and then in April went back to work again. In August she contracted polio. She was immediately hospitalized and hot packs were applied twenty-four hours a day until her recovery was assured. With the help of medical knowledge and the fervent prayers of her loved ones she recovered completely with no ill effects remaining. It was during this time that Paul graduated from medical school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Adams family returned to Utah and Paul took his nine months internship at the Thomas Dee Hospital in Ogden from Sept. 1944 to July 1945. Margaret worked at the Veterans Hospital in Salt. Lake from September to January and then moved to Ogden and worked in the office at the Thomas Dee Hospital until Paul was finished with his internship. World War. II was then on and Paul went from there into the Navy, serving some fourteen months during which time he was stationed in Farragut, Idaho, Minneapolis, Minn., San Francisco, Calif., and finally Clearfield, Utah. Margaret went to Salt Lake City to live and it was here in March 1946 that their second.son, David, was born, Less than two and a half months after David’s birth his nearly two and a half year old brother, Ricky, died of leukemia in Salt Lake City and his body was taken to Provo and buried beside his grandfather Christensen. <span id="page-908"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the war ended Paul took up private medical practice, first in Manti, Utah for a year and a half (1946-1947) and then in Delta, Utah for the years 1947-1950. During that time a baby girl, Marsha, was born to him and Margaret (July 1947) in Salt Lake City. A third son, Dennis, came to bless their home in March 1950 and was also born in Salt Lake City.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon after the Korean War broke out and Dr. Paul rejoined the Navy. He was assigned first to Bremmerton and then Pensacola, Florida, where he took naval air training and graduated as a Flight Surgeon. In September 1951 he was sent to the Air Station at Alameda, Calif. and his family was permitted to join him there. It was there in December 1951 that the couple’s fifth child, Douglas, was born. From here Paul left for overseas where he served for eight months on board a carrier in Korean waters (from Mar. to Nov. 1952).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After some two years in the service Paul joined his family in California and they settled in San Lorenzo where Paul set up his own practice once again. They lived there six years, from Nov. 1952 to Nov. 1958. Then Paul decided to go into anesthesiology and they moved to Seattle, Washington, where he took up his residency at Virginia Mason Hospital and Clinic from Jan. ‘59 to Jan. ‘61, specializing. He then went with a group of anesthetists to practice at Eden Hospital in Castro Valley for a number of months.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime Margaret worked in Seattle at the Seneca Summit Hospital in surgery as night supervisor, while working days at the Medical Dental Hospital as head nurse. What a busy woman she was! In Oct, 1961, when Paul was through with his training in Seattle, he and Margaret moved with their young family to Pleasanton, Calif, and he joined the staff at the Valley Memorial Hospital in nearby Livermore. Margaret became employed as supervisor of the surgical floor at Washington Township Hospital from Apr. ‘62 until June ‘63, She then went to work as office nurse for a urologist from June ‘63 until the first part of ‘64, when she took a year off from her public labors. <span id="page-909"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Margaret returned to work at Washington Township Hospital as supervisor of both the medical and orthopedic floors the latter part of ‘64 until ‘66. At present she is employed part time as office nurse for the urologist for whom she worked before. She has included church service among her list of activities over the years. Some of the positions she has found time to hold, somehow, have been Primary secretary, YLMIA secretary, Junior Sunday School Coordinator, Stake Mutual class leader, Laurel leader, etc.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since neither nurses or doctors are immune from sickness or surgery, both Margaret and Paul have had their “bouts” with these also, especially in later years. Paul is at present recovering from one of a series of operations that have plagued him these last two years. Margaret, the smallest of the A. B. Christensen children, has had her share of operations and the like, but her power of “come back” is unusual. She seems to never stay down for long but springs right back to good health again, which she seems to be enjoying at the present time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She and Paul are also beginning to enjoy the fruits of successful parenthood. They get much joy from the accomplishments of their four living children who have all excelled in scholarship, sports and other school activities and church attainment. They welcomed their son David home from the Franco-Belgium Mission last year and have the satisfaction of seeing him back at his pre-med training at BYU in Provo. They had the pleasure of attending their daughter Marsha’s graduation in nursing at BYU this June, as well as the thrill of greeting her first baby and their first grandchild a few weeks before that graduation. They have watched with happiness the successes of their two younger boys as they win their letters in basketball and football and climb up the ladder of the Priesthood, round upon round. All these things help to cancel out the discouragements that sometimes come along the way.</p>
