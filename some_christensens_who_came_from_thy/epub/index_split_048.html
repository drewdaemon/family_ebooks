  <p class="calibre1">(2) Joseph Harold Christensen (3) “I was born Sun. 21 Oct. 1894 in the Bardsley home in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, where father had rented two rooms. He was a schoolteacher. When I was about five years old we moved to Redmond, Utah where my father and mother both taught school. I can remember trying to keep up with the older boys there playing ‘Follow Jack’ and trying to jump a wide ditch as they did. I would get wet and then would get my legs whipped with my wet stockings that had buttons on the top, and that didn’t feel so good.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next two winters father taught at Vernal, Utah so we moved there. I missed the first two grades of school, as mother taught me at home while in Vernal. Then we moved back to Gunnison and I attended school there until I was twelve. At that time they felt that I was too young to go away to school so I took the eighth grade over since there was no high school in Gunnison at that time. The following year I went to Ephraim, Utah and attended Snow College, living with some people by the name of Nielson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My first trip to Salt Lake City came about this time the summer I was thirteen or fourteen, Alma Fredrickson, a boy who lived with us for nine years and was just like a brother, and I decided to see the big city. I don’t remember how we got there or who we went with but I do remember we both had new straw hats and we wanted to see the trains. We got up on the viaduct to look down on the trains as they passed below and our hats blew off and we lost them and besides got peppered with hot cinders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“About 1910 father fed between twenty and thirty milk cows down on his brother Albert’s Gunnison ranch about a mile or two west of town. I had to go down there both before and after school for a time to help milk them. I was pretty happy when he sold the carload to the Clover Leaf Dairy and I got rid of that job.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The year after attending Snow College at Ephraim, which was just a preparatory school, I attended first year High School in Manti and lived <span id="page-682"></span>with Grandpa and Grandma Christensen a few blocks north and east of the schoolhouse. That is when I first met a girl named Herma Keller. The year after that, since a two-year High School had just been started in Gunnison, I went back home for my second year of High School training. I was Gunnison High School’s first studentbody president that year. The following two years I finished high school at Manti. I was on the basketball team both of those years - captain of the team - center - and star player. We went to Provo for the finals the second year. I was also studentbody president of Manti High that second year (1914-15).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I dated Herma Keller - we were in school together. She was very active in school plays, etc., and we both belonged to the Dramatic Club of 1915. We were married the next year, 28 Dec. 1916, in the Manti Temple. There were eight years between my only living sister, Ruth Ellen, and I, mother having lost three babies between us. I had three younger brothers at the time I was married - Myron, Virgil and Marvin. Another brother, Don, was born just four days after my marriage. Mother attended our wedding celebration at the Keller home the night of our marriage and I didn’t even know she was expecting. I knew little about the ‘bees and the birds’ at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After Herma and I were married we lived in Gunnison until our first baby, Cloyd, was six months old (Jan. 1918) and then we moved to the farm east of Gunnison into the house Dad had built there earlier for some farm workers. Previously I had worked with Dad on this farm in summers and during school when I had time, but now I took it over myself. I raised sugar beets, sheep and cattle. I was also busy in church activities, teaching in the M.I.A. and later acting as second counselor.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Herma and I had four children, three boys and a girl. When Dorothy, our youngest, was ten years old (1935) we moved back to town so the children would be closer to school and church. We rented a Sorensen home in the northwest part of Gunnison. We then built a lovely new brick home of our own in northeast Gunnison, but we were only <span id="page-683"></span>in it a short time when Herma passed away, 12 May 1940. I was single for two years and then I married a widow, Stella Sorenson Averett. We met in Salina and were married in Richfield 25 May 1942. She also had several children but she was wonderful to me and mine.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was on the Gunnison City Council fourteen years, board member of the Gunnison Irrigation Company eight years, treasurer of the City Canal Company for six years and Watermaster for many years also. More recently I was on the government appointed commission to buy farms in Sanpete County for nonmarginal farmers. I served in this capacity for six years.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Harold’s daughter Dorothy passed away following an automobile accident, 29 Aug. 1963. His second wife, Stella, died rather suddenly 19 Nov. 1967. Harold became rather discouraged after that and his heart condition of long standing seemed to get worse. He visited his sister Ruth Ellen Hansen in California for some weeks around Christmas. He returned home to the farmhouse where he and Stella had lived for several years, the farm itself now being owned by his son Keller who had built it into one of the finest cattle farms in the area. Keller and sometimes Cloyd came to have breakfast with him every morning. They found him still in bed Monday morning, 11 Mar. 1968. He had passed away in his sleep during the early hours. He was buried 14 Mar. 1968 in the Gunnison cemetery beside his wife Herma.</p>
