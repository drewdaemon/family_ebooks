    <p class="calibre1">The courage and devotion of the Saints who had their roots in Denmark, and others of the Scandinavian countries, and whose lives were modified by the gospel, have been seldom equaled. The posterity of the thousands of these Latter-day Saints, who left their homes in that bright land for the sake of the gospel, should remember them with fervent gratitude and thanksgiving!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Gathering to Zion” was not stressed among the Scandinavian members of the restored Church until 1852; but when it was, it was found that the Danish people were ready and eager. The incessant persecutions, in nearly all parts of the mission, increased their desire to emigrate. Accounts of the growth of the Church, in the tops of the beautiful mountains far away to the west, were often relayed to the Northland, urging the brothers and sisters there to “come to Zion and help build up the kingdom!” The scriptures were searched and it was pointed out that those who answered this call would surely be assisting in the fulfillment of prophecy; for was it not written in the Holy Bible about such things? They read from Micah 4:1-2: “But in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Saints of the mission were counseled by the elders to do all in their power to practice thrift and save to emigrate to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Though some 17 Danish Saints had emigrated independently in 1850, the first organized emigration from the Scandinavian Mission, under Church direction, took place 11 March 1852, when 28 members, mostly Danes, <span id="page-53"></span>sailed from Liverpool, England, in the ship “Italy,” [Andrew, the ship should be in italics but I can’t just italicize one word] bound for America and “Zion.” (Ole Ulrick Christian Mønster, a former Baptist and one of the very first LDS converts in Denmark, was in charge of this group.) In 1855 quite a group of Saints from Iceland were among those emigrating to Utah. They settled in Spanish Fork among a thriving group of Danish Saints there. By the end of 1857 upwards of 2,000 Scandinavians, mostly Danish, had left the mission, bound for Zion’s headquarters in America. That fall, all foreign missionaries of the Church were called home because of the coming of Johnston’s Army to Utah, which threatened war. This supposed “Utah War” never took place, however, but Mormon conversions in Denmark were lowered because of a shortage of missionaries, and emigration for the year was reduced to 70.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Utah, a Church immigration fund had been set up to help the incoming Saints and from which they could borrow for their passage to Zion. Church wagon trains were often sent to the Missouri and Mississippi River junctions to meet companies of the poorer Saints and bring them on west across the plains. At the close of 1860 part of the tithing collected in the foreign missions, heretofore used for the expenses of the missionaries, branches, and conferences in those areas, was made available for the emigration of the poor, of whom there were many. From then on the Danish missionaries, as well as those in other foreign missions, had to sustain themselves, while funds for the maintenance of branches and conferences were raised by the free-will offerings of the local Saints. Thus were these members tried and tested; but it seemed that the added sacrifices and efforts brought manifold blessings in their wake. A great spirit of brotherhood grew in that northern mission. It was as if a magic wand had been waved over the heads of all its members, with the accompanying command of “Let there be charity among you!” It is heart-warming to learn of the love and sacrifices of these people for each other and the gallant generosity of the more prosperous in behalf of the less fortunate of their associates. <span id="page-54"></span>For example, “Brent Nielsen was so free in outfitting his brethren and preparing their passage that he was warned by the missionaries that some might accept the money and then apostatize. To Jacob Bohn, the hymn writer, he said: ‘You need never repay me because you labor for God’s kingdom”; “Jens Andersen of Veddern, Aalborg County, assisted no fewer than sixty of his fellow converts to emigrate; but, like Moses of old, he was never permitted to set foot in the promised land, as he died en route on the North Sea in 1862, soon after leaving his native Denmark”; “Andrew Eliason, a well-to-do Swedish land owner, sold his estate and paid the passage for a hundred of his brothers and sisters in the gospel to start out for Zion.” In 1862, in New York, it was discovered that many of the poorer Saints lacked funds to continue west. The financially able Scandinavian immigrants immediately donated money to assist their less-fortunate friends west to Florence, Nebraska, where they were met by Church trains with supplies and means to take them on to Zion. “A Danish brother, Lars Petersen, about 30 years of age, who had assisted about twenty poor Saints to emigrate, was accidentally drowned in the ‘Weeping Water,’ a stream near Wyoming, Nebraska, where he, together with others, went to bathe. He was buried June 28th with much expression of sorrow by the sympathizing Saints.” These compassionate desires of the more wealthy of the brethren to help those in need often made it possible for friends and neighbors to go to Zion together.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The price of emigration seemed high and far above the reach of many of those who desired to go. It was announced that for each adult the cost was 150 Rigsdaler ($75) provided one walked across the plains; but if one wished to share a wagon with seven other adults it would cost 200 Rigsdaler ($100) each. Those expecting to emigrate under the above terms were to send their money, names, ages, occupations, dates of birth, etc., to their respective conference presidents, advancing at the same time 40 Rigsdaler for each handcart emigrant or 80 Rigsdaler for each one planning to go by wagon. This money was forwarded to America <span id="page-55"></span> for the purchase of equipment for the journey across the plains, such as handcarts, wagons, oxen, and provisions. In 1865, due to the inflation brought on by the Civil War in America, the price of everything was higher there. A wagon that year, at the outfitting places, was about $200 in greenbacks or $100 in gold, and a team of oxen sold for about $150 on the average.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">An amusing story is told of a group of Danish immigrants of 1853 on the American Plains near Keokuk, Iowa, where they had received their oxen and wagons for the journey westward: “Some of the Danishmen, disliking the American way of driving oxen in yokes, hitched up their beasts of burden in regular Danish fashion. But they had forgotten one thing—the oxen were American. The poor beasts were half frightened to death and started out in a wild run. A council meeting was called in which it was decided that it would be easier for the immigrants to learn American ways than it would for the oxen to work with Danish harnesses. Too many of the oxen had never been hitched up before and this, coupled with many inexperienced drivers, soon ended up to many upset wagons in gullies and ditches.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indeed, all was not roses! Though anti-Mormon opposition died down in Denmark for a few years; in 1860-61 it again rode high in some parts of that country, especially in northern Jutland, where it became impossible once again for the Saints to hold public meetings. Fuel was added to the flame of hostility when it became known that a group of Scandinavian emigrants had apostatized in 1862 near Omaha, Nebraska, on their way to Zion. They sent many false reports back home, several of which were printed in Danish newspapers with relish. Some of the sectarian priests reprinted the letters in tract form, with their own embellishments, causing feelings against the Mormons to rage. Elders and Saints alike were mistreated because of these malicious reports. The renewed rantings against the restored Church, however, only accelerated the Church’s success: baptisms increased in the mission and so did emigration. Who wanted to remain in Denmark and be treated <span id="page-56"></span>like dirt under feet, not only by ruffians but by neighbors, former friends, and sometimes even one’s very own flesh and blood as well? And this, merely because one desired to worship as he chose. So, emigrate one must, if only to assuage one’s pride, but mostly to find peace and security for oneself and family among people of good will. Even though the mortality rate of some of the companies crossing to Zion was high, particularly when the dreaded disease of cholera attacked, that was a chance they had to take. “Zion” was for the persecuted, and the promise of it beckoned like a great light to the Scandinavian Saints and thousands of them decided to follow its gleam.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By 1860, there were 4,416 members in the Danish mission: 1,107 were new that year, with 240 members emigrating to Zion. In 1861, baptisms rose to 1,954 and around 1,000 emigrated; in 1862, 1,977 souls were baptized and no fewer than 1,556 left, in four different companies, for the “Valley of the Mountains.” During 1863, new converts totaled 1,587, but emigration was limited to 1,458. The branches and conferences of the LDS church in Denmark and her sister kingdoms were being impoverished by the emigration of these stalwart members, while the little kingdom of Denmark was being drained of some of her finest blood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the beginning of 1864, war—which had been threatening for some time between Denmark on one side and Prussia and Austria on the other—broke out and on February lst the armies of those two powerful German states crossed the Danish border into Jutland and the war was on over the age-old controversy about Slesvig and Holstein. It was an unhappy experience for the Saints in Jutland and elsewhere in Denmark too. Among the Danish brethren subject to military duty were a number of young LDS missionaries who were immediately forced to take up arms in the fight; a few, however, were able to hurriedly emigrate before they were drafted. Thus many of the best native elders were torn from their fields of labor and the work of the few others who remained was suspended in some measure, In the Island of Fyen (Funen) the American missionaries had a hard time because <span id="page-57"></span>Danish troops stationed there took them prisoners, tried them as spies, and imprisoned them for a time. The retreating Danish forces fleeing through Jutland in May 1864 and the victorious Prussians who followed them caused havoc and all kinds of trouble for the few missionaries who remained there. They overran the whole Jutlandic peninsula, some even going north as far as Skagen (Jutland’s nose). In Aalborg, the German troops took possession of the Saints’ meeting hall, thus preventing the holding of meetings in the area. The increase in Church membership in Denmark, understandably, was not as great that year, nor was emigration; but in Sweden and Norway, both proceeded about as usual. However, the determination to “go up to Zion” was just as great, for emigration was a goal becoming more and more desirable to the Scandinavian members. In reporting on the mission at the close of that year, President Carl Widerburg wrote: “The spirit of gathering is great among the Saints, and those who can are preparing to emigrate next season. Would [that] we had means enough to emigrate the poor, honest and faithful souls who are struggling here in poverty, hardly able to support themselves, work being scarce and wages low.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was war going on in the United States of America then too. It was a bloody Civil War in which her President, Abraham Lincoln, sought to preserve the Union as well as set the black slaves of the country free. While Denmark’s war then only lasted about six months, America’s lasted well over three years and was still going on in the early part of 1865. Since things there were so unsettled, prices so high, and things in general in more or less confusion, the Church authorities in Utah decided not to send wagon trains east that year; so only those who could afford to outfit themselves for the plains crossing were advised to emigrate. One company of Saints, numbering 557, left Copenhagen on May 4th of that year, however, bound for Zion; and with the exception of one single day’s storm, the weather was mostly fair and favorable during its entire voyage. But this was <span id="page-58"></span> not always the condition of things on board, for beside the Scandinavian Saints, a number of other emigrants crossed the Atlantic on that trip. Elder Christoffer J. Kempe wrote of this:—“While peace and good will reigned among the Saints, the others, who were Lutherans, Baptists and Methodists, lived more like cats and dogs together; some had disputes and engaged in fights, others played cards and swore, while some preached; altogether there was real pandemonium.” Three adults died on the way, and twenty-five children succumbed from measles and scarlet fever. One day, a fire started on board and created quite a panic before it was doused. Meeting a ship coming from America, the west-going emigrants were informed that the Civil War there was over and the Union had won. All were ordered on deck, where they gave many rousing cheers for the Red, White, and Blue! It took this company of emigrants 190 days to complete their journey to Zion; namely, 42 days from Copenhagen to New York; 12 days from New York to Wyoming, Nebraska; 36 days preparing for the journey across the plains (since no Church wagons awaited them); and 100 days travel from Wyoming to Salt Lake City. The journey across the plains was not without danger as the Indians were on the warpath and the “Black Hawk War” was raging in the state of Deseret (Utah). At Fort Laramie, this company, in 45 ox-drawn wagons, was halted and warned by U.S. officers there not to go any farther west because of the hostility of the Indians. Free passage was offered to them to any other part of the United States to which they wished to. A meeting of the Saints was called where the brethren decided to reject this offer and take their chances on reaching Zion; so they went on. Elder Peter A, Nielsen, one of these 1865 emigrants, gave this account of what followed: “About three days out from Laramie (at a place called Wood Hollow, where we camped [at] noon), while the men were driving the teams to a watering place about three quarters of a mile from camp, about a dozen and a half well[-]armed Indians sprang from their ambush in the woods and tried to drive off our oxen. We opened fire and this frightened the oxen and they ran back to camp, but seven of the brethren were badly <span id="page-59"></span> wounded. John Swenson had two arrows in his left arm and Peter ‘Doctor’ had one in his cheek and one clear through his neck. A Swedish brother came into camp with an arrow in the small of his back and was not able to walk again on the journey. All we could do to relieve the sufferers was to let them sit down on a wagon hub with their backs against the spokes while we, using as surgical instruments common blacksmith’s pincers or nippers, extracted the arrows from all except Peter ‘Doctor.’ The arrow in his neck could not be moved until we found a pair of extra-long-handled pincers. Then, laying the man upon the ground with his head resting upon an ox-yoke, two men sat upon him while another, with one strong jerk, pulled the arrow out. Brother Holmgreen was shot by a bullet and taken up for dead, but [he] recovered. A man by the name of Andersen was shot by a bullet, which took off a bit of his cheek and a chunk of his nose. Brother Frederick Gruntvig came into camp with an arrow fastened into his right hip; his wife had been carried off by the Indians and no more has been seen of her.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Snow overtook these weary people before they reached their destination the fore part of November. Had they not been helped in at last by relief mule-teams and provisions, they might never have made it. Emigrating, even at its best, was no easy matter; but the Scandinavian emigration kept up.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1866 was the last year that the emigrants traveled all the way across the plains by handcarts or covered wagons, as the transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad reached Omaha, Nebraska, by 1867. Also in 1867 some of the Saints crossed the Atlantic by steamship, but the cost proved so high that sailing ships were again pressed into service for awhile. On 10 May 1869 the railroad reached Utah and the days of sailing-ship and ox-team travel were ended for LDS emigrants. The journey then, by steamship and railroad, could be made from Denmark to New York in 13 days and on west to Utah in another 14. From Copenhagen to Utah in 27 days was quite a feat, considering that it sometimes took all of six months the old <span id="page-60"></span>way. The Saints jogged along in fine style on those early railroad trains at between 12 to 15 miles per hour. Omaha to San Francisco was $40 by train, “emigrant class.” These emigrant cars were usually attached to freight trains. Yes, emigration was like magic when one traveled in a modern all-the-way-to-Zion-in-comfort company!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By the end of that century some 30,000 Scandinavian Saints had migrated to the Rocky Mountains, and they continued to “cross over.” They were hardy people of high character and dependability with splendid reserve power. By far the majority of these were from the little kingdom of Denmark. It is a somewhat startling fact that just one hundred years after the flame of the gospel was first kindled along the shores of the North Sea. Forty-five percent of the total membership of the Latter-day Saint church was made up of Scandinavians and their descendants. These plucky, sturdy people have been adding their strength to this church now for the last one hundred and eighteen years; strength of numbers yes, but strength of character and works as well. No other strain or race has contributed more to the upbuilding of the great western section of the United States than the Danish and their fellow northlanders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">God has led a chosen people out of many “Babylons” by the mouths of his prophets. Exodus in the Bible, one of our earliest accounts of a religious migration, tells how the children of Israel wandered with Moses for 40 years in the wilderness before they reached their “Promised Land.” The Book of Mormon gives a history of the migration of another favored people who sailed with Father Lehi across the great Pacific to distant shores, seen by him in vision. The Puritans and Pilgrims of the 1620s traveled in ships like the Mayflower to the rock-bound coasts of New England to escape religious persecutions; and the Mormon pioneers of 1847, vanguards of thousands who followed, crossed the great American plains in search of a place where they too might worship in freedom. The massive emigration of Scandinavian Saints who traveled equally long distances, both by land and sea, to join the pioneers in Zion, is just as great a movement as any of these. When <span id="page-61"></span> the departing Danes took a long, last look at the “Lovely Land” and sailed away, they were leaving behind the country that had cradled their kinfolk for a thousand years and the forces which had woven each everlasting fibre into the tapestry of their very beings. They crossed more than an ocean and a continent when they said goodby to Jutland and her world of green islands; they crossed latitudes of blood and longitudes of the mind. Things would never be the same for them again as they turned their faces west and set sail toward their “Promised Land.”</p>
