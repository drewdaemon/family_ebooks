  <h2 class="calibre9" id="prophecies-fulfilled">PROPHECIES FULFILLED</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Master Artist who molded the Wasatch Mountains surrounding Sanpete Valley must have loved beauty and put an extra measure of it in his work that day. He made those mountains high and strong and rugged. He remembered to garment them with blue pine forests, with groves of slim, graceful aspen and scarlet maple patches. He strung crystal ribbons of water along their arms and pinned white columbines and bluebells high upon their grassy heads. In the midst of this beauteous creation He carved out a “Bishops Chair” or a “Queens Throne”. As He tapered them off near Manti He purposely left a mound of ivory stone jutting out into the valley. Many days and seasons covered the stone mound with the gray alkali dust of the valley bottom. A few scrub cedars and pine crept out of the lower canyons and stood upon the plain gray hill; because from its summit they could see the whole valley.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One day a young Nephite came to the valley purposely to visit the small gray hill. He stood very quietly upon its crest. The hill felt the warmth and power of his magnetic person for he was a Prophet of God! His fair hair shown gold in the sunlight and his face was serene with the spirit of revelation. This Prophet, Moroni, knelt and brushed the dust from off the hill’s face and withdrew a chip of white limestone. He smiled happily as he examined it. Then he bowed his head in<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-405" title="405"></span> prayer and dedicated the hill to become a home of a sacred temple of God.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Years passed. Seasons of eternal snows and thawing winds swept the hillside. A few more cedars came out of the deep canyons to keep watch. Only the red-men visited the gray hill. Centuries of waiting followed, but these did not darken the gray hill’s memory of the Nephite prophet’s visit nor of its own glorious destiny… And again it was November - a crisp Indian summer day. The gray hill, wide-eyed with wonder, saw in the distance a caravan of strange people approaching. White-topped wagons wormed their way across the valley and drew halt under the very foot of the plain gray hill - and here they made their camp. When all were asleep late that night the cold breath of winter came out of the west, turning the enchanting colors of autumn to withered blackness much as fire would char. Everything in the valley became covered by an ermine blanket of snow and lay cold and white - everything except the watchful green cedars on the gray hill. Next day the people went to the gray hill and dug out warm homes for the whimpering children and purple-lipped women. The happy hill felt the comfort of these pioneers within it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Winter waned and days began to lengthen and warm. The hill became worried and fretful for it knew that when spring came thousands of rattlesnakes would crawl from its crevices and challenge the dugout homes of the pioneers, and it was helpless to give aid. It could only hide its ugly, muddy face and bear the humiliation. Would the gray hill’s promised destiny never be fulfilled then? Yet, when the dreadful day came, these men and women valiantly met the challenge of the poisonous fangs and slew the snakes by the hundreds. No one was bitten or injured. But ‘ere long the redmen came to torment and kill and the pioneers found their dugout homes insufficient protection. The gray hill could help this time, for she gave the stone needed to build a strong fort that saved many lives when Chief Blackhawk was on the warpath.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In spite of all, the pioneer colony grew and<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-406" title="406"></span> the gray hill supplied stone for new homes for new people. But with all the new scenes and changes the hill remembered the Nephite dedication. Then it was spring again and today this memory was especially vivid. Springtime always brought new hope. Today was April 25, 1877, and the mountain air was filled with wild flower fragrance and mating songs of the birds. A gentle night rain had washed the valley to sparkling brightness. The warm morning sun called from out the earth its verdant green carpet and spread it wide, as if to welcome a nobleman’s coming; and today the gray hill felt the footsteps of another Prophet of God.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It listened as the Prophet Brigham Young told his companion, Warren S. Snow, ‘Here is the spot where the Prophet Moroni stood and dedicated this piece of land for a temple site and that is the reason why the location is made here and we can’t move it from this spot; and if you and I are the only persons that come here at high noon today we will dedicate this ground’. Five days later construction began and soon the temple started to grow like an exquisite white flower from out the depths of the hill. Eleven more years the gray hill waited to see the Manti Temple finished and its delicate towers patterned against the sky. Then, at the glorious sight of it, the heart of the hill burst wide open with joy and let forth a flow of clear, pure spring water so that lawns, trees, shrubbery and flowers could be watered to thrifty growth.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The “Plain Gray Hill” referred to in Florence N. Bagnal’s beautiful story was anything but plain and gray when Laurs and Else Christensen, our beloved grandparents, took up their temple work in real earnest the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century in Manti. Then Temple Hill, rich in tradition, stood green and bright and crowned with a majestic temple of God; fulfilling its sacred destiny, as the prophets of old had foretold. And here to this Hill and this Temple the aging couple went faithfully and often, as brother Joseph Hatten Carpenter, Manti Temple Recorder for some forty years tells:— “… Laurs M. Christensen and his good wife, your grandparents, lived in Gunnison for many years.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-407" title="407"></span> When I was working in the temple they moved to Manti and spent their remaining years by coming almost daily to the temple. Your grandmother had quite a record of her kindred she labored for. Your grandfather worked considerably on my record. I hired him and paid him, as his own record was completed to the extent he had it. Your grandmother was a very intelligent woman, and was anxious that her children should have good educations…”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes indeed, Laurs and Else K. went often to the temple now. At first they walked the four or five blocks or so to and from their home there. Later they took the horse-drawn temple hack both ways. Grandmother eventually received numerous records of her ancient relatives on the Hvid line sent from Denmark by the researcher she had engaged on her last trip there. They each did all the work they could for their dead. They also solicited the help of some of their sons and daughters in this work, and even involved some of their grandchildren in doing baptisms for their dead. It was the custom for many years for Sanpete Valley children to be allowed the privilege of going to the Manti temple, on or soon after their eighth birthdays, to have their own baptisms in the beautiful font there. Until the practice was discontinued and other places provided, Grandmother Else took the responsibility of seeing that most of her grandchildren who lived in the area during her time had the opportunity to go there for that purpose. Pearl, the oldest grandchild, writes of this:— “I was baptized at the age of eight years. Grandma Christensen took my two cousins, Harold Christensen and Leo Nelson and myself to the Manti temple for the occasion. Afterwards she took us up the spiral stairway into the top of the temple and told us to always remember the things we saw and heard there. I shall never forget them. Grandma also took me there several times later to be baptized for the dead.” Most of the grandchildren thus favored got to climb up the winding stairway, as cousins Pearl and Harold did, and as I did, to the very tip-top of the temple’s west tower, for a breathtaking view out over the valley; and a number of them were taken by<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-408" title="408"></span> grandmother to the temple again at various times, as Pearl and I were, to be baptized for some of our Danish relatives of long ago.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nevertheless Laurs and Else didn’t bury themselves in temple work entirely but succeeded in doing some of the other things they enjoyed. Else especially loved to visit her friends - and she had a host of them. In earlier days she went by horse and buggy. Crystal Snow Witbeck remembers when “Sister Else Christensen used to stop in at Sterling on her way back and forth from Manti to Gunnison, to visit my mother, Anne Marie Nielsen Snow, and get a ‘cold glass of buttermilk’. Father, Franklin Snow, would unhitch her horse and water it in the creek by which we lived and feed and care for the animal while the two dear friends chatted away in Danish, perhaps for hours. Oh the unusual experiences your grandmother could tell about the olden days in Denmark; I wish I could remember some of those stories today.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandmother Else not only visited all around Sanpete Valley but in Salt Lake and other places and it seemed that everywhere she went she found friends to talk to. As she progressed in years she abandoned the horse and buggy and took to the train for her visits. On one of her various visits she may have been bragging a little overmuch about her “wonderful children” and the fine marriages they had made - you know how proud mothers are sometimes, when they get to going on about their offspring, and Else K, was no exception. Well, on this particular occasion a certain sister so-and-so, whom she was visiting, being perhaps a bit jealous or at least hoping to take her friend Else “down a peg or two”, finally got in her say, — “Ja, Ja, but Vena you vil haf alvays vit you!” You see Elvena was getting on in years and not yet wed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some of Laurs’ and Else’s greatest joys in later years came from visiting their children and their families. Cousin Byron remembers that his grandparents often came from their home in Manti to visit at their home east of Gunnison. “At first they came by horse and buggy,” said Byron, “and whenever we saw Grandma coming we’d go out and kill a big fat hen, for we knew she’d want to make<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-409" title="409"></span> Danish soup and dumplings right off. Father raised pigs for the market, sometimes fifty or more at a time, and occasionally when grandpa and grandma came to our house grandma would ask if we had a ‘runty pig’, referring of course to a baby pig who wasn’t doing very well, She prefered the ones with curly tails. Father always seemed to have a ‘runty pig’ when grandma paid us a visit and she just seemed to have a special talent and pride in getting runty pigs all plumped up and doing fine in scarcely no time at all. Indeed grandma certainly had a way with little pigs. One time one of these pigs got away on their way back home to Manti and grandma had a hard time getting over that ‘poor little lost pig!’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember driving to Manti with grandpa in a horse and buggy with a cow tied on behind. That was a long, slow trip. Another thing I remember about grandpa is how much he liked fish of all kinds, but especially smoked herring. He always ate fish the old Danish way, putting whole pieces into his mouth - bone and all. Soon the bones would come flying out either side of his mouth, looking like ‘cat’s whiskers’; but sometimes they got caught in his moustache and had to be untangled. Both grandpa and grandma came to help us thin beets and later to harvest potatoes, and of course father paid them. If they came from Manti on the train they walked the mile from the station at Christenburg to our house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grandma expected to be minded and usually got her way. I remember one time mother went away and left her to tend Ada and me, when we were quite young. Something we were doing bothered grandma, perhaps it was playing in the water - I don’t quite recall now. Anyway she cautioned us several times not to do it and the last time with an ‘or else’! But we continued to defy her until we could see she meant business. When she came toward us with that look in her eye - we ran. To our utter surprise she took after us and caught us and ‘ker-plunk’ her hand came down several times, where it hurt the most. I’ve never seen anyone run that fast, especially an old woman.” Perhaps grandmother Else figured<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-410" title="410"></span> that the gentle Emma’s children needed a little discipline.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cousin Ivy remembers that after they moved to Salt Lake City grandma and grandpa always came up for General and Semi-Annual Conferences and stayed at their place. She remembers her bedroom was next to theirs and she could never go to sleep early when they were there in October for they would lie in bed and talk about politics - always politics - until way into the night. Since grandmother was somewhat deaf in her later years, she talked quite loud then too.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elaine remembers that when Cullen was a wee baby he had been very fretful with eczema or something and she had taken him outside in his baby buggy to wheel him to sleep. It took a long time back and forth, back and forth. She had just gotten him fast asleep and had wheeled him into the shade and set the brake, preparatory to leaving him there to sleep for awhile, covered with mosquito netting to keep off the flies, when grandmother came walking up the path to their place. As she drew near, Elaine put her finger over her lips to indicate “be quiet”. As grandmother approached the place where Cullen lay she smiled and put her finger over her lips too. Then she leaned over the buggy to look at him, saying at the same time, “Ja, ve must be quiet for he is asleep”. But her words were not whispered but fairly “boomed out”, and of course Cullen awakened with a frightened scream. Dear grandmother, she had no way of knowing how loud she whispered, because of her deafness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cousin Rose wrote of Laurs and Else:— “Memories of my grandparents are all too few, as I was pretty young, but I do remember grandma coming to our house to quilt for us and allowing me to ‘card’ the wool, much to my delight. Grandpa I remember with white hair blowing and always a sweet smile and a moustache that tickled. Somehow pictures of Albert Schweitzer remind me of him. I’m sure these two lovely people were largely responsible for the many wonderful traits and beliefs that our Dad passed on to us and I am very thankful indeed to be a part of their progeny.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-411" title="411"></span> The Great Giver of Life was continually sending new little souls to earth to bless the lives of Laurs and Else’s children during those years, but the Grim Reaper was ever close at hand also, taking away friends and relatives dear to their hearts. A chronology of births and deaths among those close to this devoted couple, during the years 1911-1914, appears thus:— 20 May 19ll a son born to Andrew and Sarah Christensen in Leipsig, Germany, named Luther after the great Christian Reformer, Martin Luther, who began his work of reformation in that country… 1 Oct. 1911 a fifth son and eighth child born to Joseph and Roxie Christensen in Gunnison, Utah, but only the fifth child to live, named for Roxie’s youngest brother Henry but called by the name Marvin… 23 Oct. 1911 a nearly twelve pound son born to Albert and Jennie Christensen in Manti and named Phillip Van Buren, for some of his mother’s progenitors - his birth leaving Jennie in somewhat of a delicate condition… 24 Nov. 1911 Lars C. N. Myrup, missionary, Danish Emigrant of 1866, gentleman-farmer and civic leader, age 66½ years, died in Centerfield, Utah, leaving numerous descendants, having had three wives… 18 Jan. 1912 a nine pound baby girl came earlier than expected to Arthur and Millie Christensen in Coalville, Utah, where Millie had gone for medical help from their home in Upton… 19 Jan. 1912 the baby girl born to Arthur and Millie, whom they had hurriedly named Mildred, died and was buried in Coalville… 7 Mar. 1912, a baby boy was born to Louis and Florence Christensen in Gunnison, Utah, he being their sixth child, and named Weldon D… 4 Apr. 1912, a son and eighth child was born to Christian and Caroline Christensen in Salt Lake City and later named Gordon Larsen, the second name being the maiden surname of his mother… 10 May 1912, a second daughter and sixth child was born to Elsie and Alma Bartholomew in Gunnison and fittingly named Ella May which was later changed to Ellamae… 6 Mar. 1913, John Taylor Christensen, son of Christen and Anne Jensen Christensen, died in Manti, Utah at age 41. His wife Margaret and daughters Florence and Edna survived him, twins, a boy and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-412" title="412"></span> a girl, having preceded him in death… 8 Oct. 1913 Pauline C. Andersen, age 58½ years, daughter of Christen and Karen Lauritzen Christensen and Danish emigrant pioneer of 1866, died today at her home in Centerfield, being survived by her husband, Andrew Andersen, three daughters, Annie Lenora “Nora” (Jensen), Karen Pauline “Carrie”, and Mattie Isabella (Dack), several grandchildren and two brothers, Laurs M. C. Christensen of Manti and Christen Christensen of Jutland, Denmark… 3 Apr. 1914, Anne Jensen Christensen, widow of Christen Christensen and Danish emigrant pioneer of 1866, died at age 76 at her home in Gunnison following an illness. She is survived by one daughter, Caroline C. Jensen, three sons, Christen K., Andrew E., and Joseph Y. Christensen, two step-sons, Laurs M. C. and Christen Christensen, the latter of Denmark, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren. But in spite of it all, life went on for most of the Christensens and their loved ones, at least a little longer, and the sun continued to shine - or the rain fell.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we recall, when Andrew B. had been preparing to go to Europe in 1910 he had sold his home in Salt Lake City to his older brother Chris. Chris had in turn sold his old home in Gunnison to his youngest brother Arthur M. These Christensen brothers and sisters were great to stick together and help each other out, In the latter part of 1915 the sister Elsie, having had somewhat of a temporary misunderstanding with her husband, felt it necessary to sell her lovely red brick home in Gunnison and move to cheaper quarters, so brother Arthur M. bought her home and returned his home, formerly owned by Chris, in on the deal. Thus Elsie and her five children moved into the old home and Arthur, Millie and their four children occupied the red brick house. Louis D., who had purchased his parents’ old home in Gunnison, was away most of the time, being employed in Wyoming with Chris and the Bennion Livestock Company, of which Chris was general manager. Chris had a home on “The Weber” where he took his family to live in the summers, but during the winters they were mostly alone in Salt Lake City where the children could be in school. Elvena divided her<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-413" title="413"></span> time between her sister-in-law Caroline, in Salt Lake City, her sister-in-law Florence and her sister Elsie in Gunnison, for she was still single and much sought after as an unfailing support in the homes of each and everyone of her loved ones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chris, always interested in the welfare of others but especially in his own family and his parents and brothers and sisters, was worried about Elsie and her children and about Louis, whose family was so far away and needed to be near him. He was also concerned about Elvena, whom he thought should be getting a husband, or at least something of her own around her. So it was about this time that he must have conceived the idea of establishing a large family-owned and operated ranch in Wyoming.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He himself had purchased 160 acres of land east of Lyman, Wyoming, a few years before, from the Bennion Livestock Company. There was a lot of acreage adjoining his property there that could be had almost for the asking. An earlier home steading act involving that part of the territory allowed any responsible person to take up to 160 acres there who would settle on the land, fence it in, cultivate it and add improvements. As a further inducement to settlers the “Grazing Homestead Act of 1916” increased the amount of land a person could homestead to 640 acres, practically saying “here is land - transform it into a farm and it is yours!” It must have seemed a great idea to Chris, as well as a solution to a number of the family problems, for some of his folks to take advantage of this opportunity to obtain land there and work together to build a successful ranch. And being a man of action, as well as vision, he must have successfully presented his plan to various of his brothers and sisters, for some of them soon filed on portions of land adjoining that which he owned twelve miles east of Lyman, Wyoming.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In January 1916 Louis took up 640 acres of land near Chris and their sister, Elsie Bartholomew, also took up 640 acres at the same time. Chris’ oldest daughter Pearl filed on 320 acres of property directly adjoining her father’s, about <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-414" title="414"></span> the same time. A little later the sister Elvena took up 320 acres of land adjoining Louis’ property and Andrew filed on 160 acres nearby. In fact, each piece of property adjoined that of another member of the family, making it quite a tract of land in their joint possession. Earlier Chris had named his place “The Oasis” - so the Oasis it was for all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Previously Chris had built a nice barn on his land, with stalls for eight horses and pig pens and a chicken coop and fixed places for hay and grain stacks. Now he had a four-room frame dwelling built on the dividing line between his and his daugh- ter Pearl’s newly acquired property, with two rooms on her side and two rooms on his, with a pantry and clothes closets too. This house was completed the forepart of March 1916. In the meantime Louis was making improvements on his place, putting up fences and having a three-room log and frame house built for his family. They were also having a two-room house and attic built on Elsie’s property to house them and satisfy homesteading requirements. Sometime later a two-room log cabin with an attic was built on the sister Elvena’s piece of land. A well on Chris’ place, though salty, supplied water for the animals, but drinking water for the various families had to be hauled in large barrels from a spring in White Sand Hills about two miles east of The Oasis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 27 March 19l6 a grand exodus took place from Gunnison, Utah, involving Elsie and her three boys and two little girls and Florence and her six children, now including her second daughter, little two year old Alice Fern. Elvena must have also gone along to help with the children, though she had not yet applied for her land in Wyoming. The night before the whole crew slept at sister Emma’s, for she lived within a mile of the depot, and that morning they all boarded the train and headed for Lyman, Wyoming. Louis must have come long enough to help them move and Chris and his older boys, Elmer and LeRoy, must have been on the other end of the line to see that they all got out to The Oasis safely. And since Louis’ house was not yet finished, nor Elsie’s either, Pearl<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-415" title="415"></span> remembers that they all stayed for awhile at her’s and her father’s house, until the other two houses were ready to move into. LaFaun remembers how crowded they were and they slept on the floors and some even had beds on the table. Edith remembers that there didn’t ever seem to be food enough to go around then.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But soon those that were able were out tilling the soil and planting. Elsie tells of this in her own history:— “The children and I worked hard clearing the sagebrush, doing some planting of crops and garden and making the necessary improvements to ‘prove up’ on our homestead property for two difficult summers.” The Oasis raised potatoes, not only for the folks who lived there but also to help supply the needs of those employed by the Bennion Livestock Company. I understand Elsie had charge of the planting and harvesting of numerous bushels of potatoes, which netted her a little extra money. Grandfather Christensen went up to Wyoming on occasions to help with the work there, and grandmother sometimes went up to visit. In telling of those days she once said, with tears of emotion in her eyes, ”My proud, my beautiful Else, grubbing away there - working like a hired man in the dirt!” Surely grandmother Else had forgotten how she herself had labored at similar menial tasks when she had lived in the United Order in Mayfield so many years before.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Several years before, back in Sanpete, Albert had sponsored one of his father’s Danish relatives and her family, making it possible for her, her husband and two young daughters to come from Denmark to America to live. He gave the husband a job and the family a humble home on his ranch west of Gunnison. Actually Laurs and Else had been instrumental in arranging the whole thing soon after their return from Denmark. These Danish relatives, who had joined the church there, were eager to emigrate to Zion and needed help in doing so, which Albert provided. But being unused to American ways with the land, the cousin’s husband, Niels Jensen, turned out to be an unprofitable farmer, though Albert gave him reasonable opportunity to learn. So Albert’s<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-416" title="416"></span> brother Joseph took the Jensen family off his hands and tried Niels Jensen out on his farm east of Gunnison. Joseph even built the Danish relatives a home there, which is still standing on the Keller Christensen farm. But Niels Jensen was also a disappointment as a farmer on Joseph’s place as well, so one of the Myrup cousins gave him a job on his place. Lois Myrup Anderson writes something of this:— “A Danish cousin of our Christensen’s, and her husband Niels Jensen, lived in Hill Creek, Uinta County one summer working for Uncle Adolph Myrup. She bragged a lot about her ‘wealthy family in Denmark’ and showed us pictures of their big house there.” The Niels Jensen family eventually ended up in California and seemed to like it better there, These were among the few of grandfather Christensen’s Danish relatives to join the Church and move to America, None of grandmother’s relatives ever moved here or came even to visit, as far as we know—nor did any of them join the church.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About a month after Louis and Elsie and their families had moved to Wyoming, Albert’s wife Jennie, who had been in poor health for years, became seriously ill and was taken to Salt Lake City for special medical treatment. Some six weeks later, Thur. 27 July 1916, she passed away there and was brought back to Manti for burial. Thus Albert, busy as Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court, was left without his beloved companion and with five motherless children on his hands. Of course Laurs and Else and others of the family did all they could at the time to comfort and assist their bereaved loved ones, and Elvena immediately came into her brother’s home to care for things there as best she could. Letters of condolence poured in from all over the State and numbers of newspapers commented on “Judge Christensen’s great loss”. Yet few could do much to assuage the grief in the home where “the light had gone out” for a time at least. Yet “Aunt Vena” was able to help so much with the children then and of this one of them, Elaine, writes:— “I may never be able to give Aunt Vena credit for all she was to me when she came to live with us after mother’s death. I remember very<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-417" title="417"></span> little of her before that time and might have forgotten as much as I have had I not been keeping a journal while she was at our home. Although at the time, by years she numbered thirty to my fourteen, we shared secrets, activities and heart pangs. Besides providing me and my friends with home-made bread spread with thick cream and sugar for an after school snack, she also provided a sounding board for and a sympathetic understanding of my restless teen-age fancies, as evidenced by an entry in my journal, dated 14 June 1917:— ‘Today has been another beautiful June day with its deep blue sky and glowing sunset. We have completed our housecleaning today and are very glad to get it over with. After the cleaning was done, which was about 7:30 p.m., Aunt Vena and I decided to follow the railroad track until dark. We sent after some candy and nuts and crackers, which we wrapped in a bundle and started off, saying we were going to grandma’s. We went west and then followed the long silver threads of tracks until we thought we had gone almost four miles; then we stopped and wished on each others bead rings which Hale had given us. We wished on our bracelets and necklaces too. I wished three things for myself and one very nice wish for Aunt Vena - that she would soon fine a nice man for a husband. After that, eating and jabbering away at each other, we followed a road which we thought would lead us into town. But the road had been flooded over and, as I had a little hole in my shoe, I got my foot wet. Finally we came to Main Street where we passed the dance hall and heard the music. I began to pity myself because I wasn’t there. Aunt Vena said that we’d go home and if Daddy wasn’t there we’d get cleaned up and she’d take me to the dance for a little while. My hair had been in curls since Saturday and Aunt Vena told me that it really looked awful. We fixed and fixed but it still looked like a rat’s nest and it was black where I had curled it on the stove poker. So we didn’t go. She told me that she would help me plan the party that we were going to have in a few days… June 16, 1917 (Day of the party) We’ve worked hard carrying benches, tables, victrola and lights for the lawn. Dear Aunt Vena has<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-418" title="418"></span> worked so hard cooking and sewing for us, etc.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After mother died Aunt Vena (bowing before the perplexities of problems attendant upon caring for five young children) often dreamed of Jennie. She must have seen her in many teaching situations of all kinds, taking time out to nod encouragement and approval of Aunt Vena, who stood humbly on the other side of the veil, seeking help. That mother adored her for her sweetness, gentleness and selflessness I have no doubt. As I look back through the eyes of experience I can now know how tired she must have been from all of our varied demands, how lonely for love and attention from friends her own age and yet how patient, understanding and available she was for our diversified family needs. I know that she showed a great compassion for all of us and that she was especially close to little Phillip, as she must have been also to mother. Aunt Vena slept in the Blue Room with five year old Phil who clung to her as a substitute for his mother. One morning just at dawn she awoke to see Phil smiling and nodding at someone in the room. Aunt Vena turned inquiringly just in time to see a flounce of skirt disappear down the hall. Upon asking Phil who the visitor was, he replied, ‘I’ve been talking to my mama.’ That Aunt Vena herself lived close to the angels, I’ve never doubted.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else were then living a little nearer to Albert’s in Manti, since they had given up their place on 1st North and 1st East and moved to a smaller place one-half block west of Main Street on what is now known as Union Street. In fact they were living directly across the street north from the Tabernacle Block that had become so important to them in their first years in Zion, some fifty years before, when the Black Hawk Indian War was in progress. They had contracted to buy this 32-ft. by 107½ ft. lot and the house on it from John Lawrence and Anne J. Lowry. Doubtless they had heard of the possibility of buying it from their long time friend and associate, Eliza R. Bartholomew, who herself had contracted to purchase the place from one Lottie Hoggan and then changed her mind after paying $100.00 down<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-419" title="419"></span> on the bargain. Sister Bartholomew had sold her contract to the Lowrys and Laurs and Else in turn had got it from them. A warranty deed and abstract to this property were made out to Laurs, 17 Apr. 1922, indicating that by that time the place had been fully paid for and terms of the contract met. The price they had paid for it was $850 plus interest, and another $100 to Sister Bartholomew for her equity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The house itself was a long, rather narrow two-story affair of adobe that opened almost directly onto the front sidewalk on the south. It must have previously been a little shop or store of some kind with living quarters built on behind and was first owned and built by a DeMill family. As I recall, there were two rooms in front, a bedroom, and a front room from which one descended down several steps to a large living or “sitting room” and kitchen area with a pantry. From here there was a back stairs leading up to a couple of spare bedrooms and an outside door to the west leading to a small porch. There was a cemented cellar underneath but no inside bathroom. There was little room for animals on the narrow lot, except for a few chickens and perhaps a “runty pig” or a lamb or two. There was a small raspberry patch and room for enough garden for the two of them, and they had enough primary water right in Manti City Creek to keep it watered.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This small place was about all Laurs and Else could take care of at their ages, since they were then both pressing seventy. Although they were two-and-a-half blocks farther away from the temple than before, yet they were nearer the Post Office and center of town and some nearer their son Albert’s. All in all this must have proved to be a comfortable arrangement for them. The temple hack still continued to drive around regularly to take them to their chosen work in the Manti Temple, since they were very busy there; for in 1915 Else had commenced the great redemption work for her noble Hvid progenitors, which line she had obtained back almost nine centuries, through her professional Danish researcher, to one Skjalm Hvide who had been born about 1052<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-420" title="420"></span> in Roskilde, Copenhagen Amt, or County, Denmark. Skjalm Hvide had married the Princess Signe Haroldsen, daughter of King Harold IV of Denmark, or Harold “Hen” as he was anciently known, and his wife Margrethe. Laurs helped Else by doing the work for her male relatives, including old Skjalm Hvide. He also did work for some of the male dead of Brother Joseph Carpenter’s, as has been mentioned, and for others, by which means he earned a modest living. It helped some in regards to their living when, by a Government act of March 4, 1917, Laurs became entitled to a small pension amounting to $20.00 per month payable quarterly, for his service in the Black Hawk Indian War as a “Private in Captain John H. Tuttle’s Company, Utah Militia Infantry.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else must have started out housekeeping in their new location with mostly brand new furniture and equipment, or at least what was new to them, though some may have been second hand. Interestingly enough, an itemized bill for furniture, rugs, etc., purchased about the time of their moving, was found among their papers in the Old Brown Kit. It was from the Michigan Furniture Company, 430-36 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah and reads as follows:— “Buffet - $35.00; Wash Stand - $2.50; Library Table - $15.00; Mirror - $5.00; 3 chairs - $9.00; 4 chairs - $14.00; Rocker - $15.00; Kitchen Table - $6.00; Refrigerator - $15.00; Rug - $70.00; Range - $35.00; Heater - $15.00; Sink - $1.50; S. H. Bed - $8.00; Couch - $12.00; 2 Dressers - $60.00; 12 yds Linoleum ($4.50 each) - $54.00; Dining Table - $40.00; Cupboard - $12.00; Oxidized Bed - $22.50; 6 x 9 Congoleum Rug - $15.00; 4½ x 6 Congoleum Rug - $6.00; 4 lengths Pipe - $2.00; 2 Elbows - $1.00; 2 Collars - 20¢; - Total - $551,70.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In my minds eye I can see now some of this furniture and the way it was placed in that old adobe house on West Union Street. I can still see also, in memory, some of the other things that were there which helped to “dress up!” that house and make it Grandpa’s and Grandma’s:— dark red plush covered, gilt edged Family Albums full of photos of strange people resting on the library<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-421" title="421"></span> table; hand made lace tidies here and there on the backs and arms of the rockers and couch and some well-used hand-painted velvet sofa pillows that had seen better days on the seats of the same; brightly colored hand cut, hand sewn and woven rag rugs spread over the carpets to protect the spots of greatest use; a few thrifty-looking potted plants on the window sills; some heavily framed, enlarged photographs of relatives hung on the front room walls and a gay printed calendar in the kitchen and a pendulum-swinging-clock on the clock shelf ticking off the minutes and singing out in most positive tones the precise time every hour. But Grandmother wasn’t much for collecting “do-dads” and folderol - she loved people more than things!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I used to go there often during the year after mother Jennie died, and I always felt welcome and so comfortable there. Though the house was right across the road from school, north, I would go around by way of the Post Office to pick up the mail in my grandparents’ box and take it to them on my way home from school in the late afternoons. I usually arrived at their place soon after the temple hack had dropped them off following the afternoon session in the temple. I remember Grandpa, having pulled black sateen sleeve protectors well up over the elbows of his white starched shirt, would usually be stretched out full length on the couch in the front room, resting. He was always glad for the mail; it saved him a trip to town after a wearying day at the temple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But most of all I remember Grandma, softly humming as she moved about fixing their late afternoon meal of cold sliced meat and cheese, bread, butter and jelly, coffee cake or sweet rolls and a hot drink. She would cease her humming to greet me with a smile and a loving kiss, saying, “Vel, vel, if here isn’t our dear Weryinya!” - just as if she hadn’t seen me for a time, even though I’d been there the day before and the day before that. (She always pronounced my name that way in the tender, caressing, intimate style she had of speaking to those she loved - and I loved her for it!) Then she would insist that I<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-422" title="422"></span> stay and “have a bite” with them. This I always hungrily hoped for but tried to appear reticent about - but Grandma wouldn’t be put off - and so I’d stay and pull up a chair to the dining room table in the front room where the cloth and things were set. Then she would fetch the coffee pot or the tea pot from the kitchen stove, as the case might be, and while she was filling their cups she would say in the most natural and hospitable way, “Vil you haf a cup of tea (or coffee) Weryinya?” She wouldn’t wait for an answer but would quickly place a cup and saucer for me and pour in some hot water from the teakettle, put in plenty of cream and plop in a couple of sugar cubes. She even stirred it up for me. I guess this was what they called “Brigham Tea”- the only kind of tea Brigham Young approved of for the Latter-day Saints. I was never given regular coffee or tea in my grandparents’ home, or my parent’s either. But drinking tea and coffee was one of the very few vices Laurs and Else allowed themselves; it would have been pretty hard for them to have broken this habit of a lifetime - and they never did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes on Saturdays I went to Grandmother’s in the morning when she would be doing her “heavy cooking” for the week. The most delectable eating of my childhood came if I was fortunate enough to be there when she was making “Abelskivers”, those delicious little bell shaped tender Danish apple pancakes made with plenty of fresh eggs, a little flour, salt, buttermilk, grated apple, soda and whatnot, and fried just so in small lakes of butter in little round mold pans made just for that purpose. There was magic in the way she turned them gently over. Then she rolled them in a bed of sugar and served them up piping hot with one’s favorite jelly or preserves. To me, nothing has ever tasted so “yummy” as Grandmother Else’s freshly made abelskivers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She had other kitchen specialties of course, like her Danish soup and dumplings. Her “sweet soup” and “red mush” for the makings of which she always seemed to have raspberries, red currents and a plum tree on the place, were happy changes for one who was so used to rice pudding, sego<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-423" title="423"></span> pudding, bread pudding, custard or blancmange for dessert. Then there was that home made Danish beer which all the adults in the family used to make such a fuss about. When each new batch of Grandmother’s Danish beer had duly “ripened” and was ready for the tasting, word would go out from her place and the big folks would swarm in and have a cork-popping good time of it! Though I never learned to like that harmless Danish beer that Grandma made, I loved the happiness and hospitality of those many little family festivals we had at her and Grandpa’s place when the beer was “ripe”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandmother Else could cook and she could sew and she could fix up her house, and these she did and did well, and she was the most charming, lovable hostess, in her unpretentious, homespun way, that one could imagine. She never apologized for the things she had or had not, but seemed grateful for all she had been given, but especially for all the choice opportunities that the Gospel and the Land of Zion afforded her and hers. If she yearned for fancy things for herself and her home we did not know it; but I doubt that she ever pined much for ornamental decorations, rich tapestries and fixtures, magnificent paintings or other works of art. Her needs were simple it seemed, and yet who knows, perhaps she too “dreamt that she dwelt in marble halls” at times. The only personal ornaments we ever saw her wear were simple amber ear-drops hanging from her pierced ears, an amber colored shell comb in her braided crown of amber colored hair, then streaked with grey, and a plain gold brooch. Indeed, the things Grandmother seemed most interested in were richness of the spirit and the culture of the soul. The things for which she seemed to strive most were the arts of living, serving, loving and learning. I often saw her studying by the lamplight at nights, bespectacled in little oval shaped eye glasses with fragile wire rims and bows. She loved to read - to study - to learn - to keep abreast of things. As they say of those who never quite grow old in spirit, “She grew a little green wood every year.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">During that year of 1916/17, after mother<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-424" title="424"></span> Jennie died, Aunt Vena lived with us, Albert’s family, as has been stated. About the first part of July that second summer, however, she was persuaded to leave and go to Wyoming by Uncle Chris, who seemed very anxious to get her up there for some special reason. In fact it was perhaps Chris himself who took her there on one of his various business trips back and forth from Sanpete. It turned out that he was anxious to have Vena meet a young bachelor from Upton, Utah, by the name of George T, Clark, who was one of the herders for the Bennion Livestock Co. As Chris had observed the character and habits of this man in his employ he had found him to be an all around honest, clean, good and fine fellow and was thoroughly convinced that George would make Vena a splendid husband. So Chris took Vena to stay with some of the folks and saw to it that she and George got together, doing all he could to foster a match.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was but a few weeks before Elvena Christensen and George Thomas Clark were married, for of course Chris had built each of them up to it well beforehand. They went to the Uinta County courthouse in Evanston, Wyoming, 14 Aug, 1917 to secure their license and then sought out the LDS Bishop to perform the marriage ceremony. Each of them was thirty years old at the time but they were as thrilled and happy as a couple of teenagers.</p>
