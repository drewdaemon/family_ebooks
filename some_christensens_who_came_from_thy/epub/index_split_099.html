  <p class="calibre1">(53) Vera Clark (9) writes, “I was born 12 July 1918 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, in my grandfather  and grandmother Christensen’s home. I spent most of my first two years on the ranch (The Oasis) near Lyman, Wyoming or on The Weber in northeastern Utah where my father ran sheep. Then Father went to work for Mother’s brother, Uncle Albert, running his ranch west of Gunnison, Utah. My sister Alta was born at Aunt Emma’s while we were living at the ranch and my second sister Tresia was born at the ranch and Aunt Emma took care of little Alta.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Ivan Lyon’s folks were also farming west of Gunnison for some Mellors. My folks and the Lyons visited back and forth and played cards together. The folks would do the chores at night, on occasions, get out the horse and wagon, spend the night playing cards and visiting at the Lyons, while we children slept, then drive home next morning in time to do the chores. Sometimes the Lyons would come to our house. People in Gunnison  used to tell me that the Lyons son, Ivan, once pushed me into a ditch of water. This was not quite right however, for Ivan says he remembers it well because his Dad gave him a licking because he picked me up and tried to carry me over a ditch full of water and accidently dropped me in it. I myself can’t remember this since it must have been before we moved to Goshen when I was four.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In Goshen the folks rented a place across from the George Burraston family, who were fine neighbors and have been good friends ever since. Dad finally bought a home across from Uncle Alma and Aunt Elsie Bartholomew, Mother’s sister. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The year I was in the third grade we had so much sickness - measles, mumps, chickenpox, pneumonia, and I had scarlet fever. Mother said the doctor came every day for me and my sister LaFaye, who had measles and then pneumonia. He expected me to die and her to get well. I don’t remember a thing about getting sick or being sick until I was nearly well - in fact when I started to peel. I could pull good sized patches of skin off. I can also remember the morning LaFaye died, <span id="page-900"></span> for she was the one to die while I got well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The morning she died Alta and I were awake and Mother wrapped us in quilts and took us into the room where she lay. We were still under quarantine for scarlet fever and the only one who could leave the place was Dad. He went to work, did our shopping and all. LaFaye’s funeral services were held on our lawn and they had her casket just inside the front door. It was cold, since she died 24 Feb. 1927. Mother sat near with us children all around her while Dad went with the casket to the Goshen Cemetery. It was a sad, sad time.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George Washington had his story about the cherry tree and Vera has her own “cherry”  story:- “Another thing I remember about my illness was when I regained my appetite. I was starved. I asked for a dish of cherries one day and I was so hungry I said I wanted twenty-one cherries. Dad brought me in a dish of bottled cherries, saying he had no idea how many there were. But I counted each cherry as I ate it and there were exactly twenty-one cherries.” Even in little things such as this her parents demonstrated their love for her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Aunt Emma asked me to come to Gunnison and visit them one summer. In fact, I spent two or three summers there with Uncle Charles, Aunt Emma, Ada, Imelda and sometimes Byron. After Aunt Emma died, and Ada was married and Byron was on his mission, I not only spent the summer but the whole winter in Gunnison with Imelda and Uncle Charles. I took my seventh grade work there that winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had just finished sixth grade when our family moved from Goshen to Santaquin, 1 May 1940. Dad bought a lot with no house on it. He moved a big garage from our place in Goshen onto the lot to make two rooms. We rented a house on the same block and lived in that while he built our home. When I came back from my year in Gunnison  to attend school in Santaquin I was a stranger but soon got acquainted. I graduated from the ninth grade after two winters there and then took the bus to Payson to attend high school, from where I graduated the spring of 1936. While <span id="page-901"></span> attending high school I taught in the Primary in Santaquin.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After graduation I picked berries in Provo one summer and then went to stay with cousin Elaine in Salt Lake City for about three months before she moved to Cedar City, since Ted was already down there working. She lived on 4th Ave. just around the corner and just below the steps from Memory Grove. Then I went back to Santaquin  and worked for Frank Andreason for about ten months. He lived just across the street north from the east end of our lot. His wife Lauree had milk-leg and was pregnant and they had four boys. I enjoyed working for them. One day Mother came over and asked me to come and have dinner with her as she was alone; Dad was working and the children all in school. It seemed strange to be invited to my own home for dinner.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was married 22 Apr. 1938 in Santaquin, at the home of our Bishop Karl D. Greenhalgh, to Ivan Peter Lyons (b. 28 Dec, 1915 in Ephraim, Utah to Joseph and Karen Allred Lyons). We had a reception the next night at the Union Hall, mostly dancing. The day after that we went to Ephraim to live and here we spent about fourteen years. At first Ivan worked for Glen Nielson raising turkeys but later he went to work for the Denver and Rio  Grande Railroad as a section hand for seven or  eight years. It was when he was transferred to Castle Gate and Scenic (a railroad section just below Soldiers Summit) every winter and had to board himself that he gave up railroading.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We rented for the first five or six years in Ephraim and then bought our own home there. We spent one summer living in Scenic. I went to church in Ephraim occasionally but wasn’t too active when the children were young. We moved to Wendover, Utah some sixteen years ago. Since coming here Ivan has worked for the potash plant just east of town, called Bonneville Ltd. - but now owned by Kaiser Chemicals of Oakland, California. It is a good job.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We have had ten children in these thirty years, losing one in infancy whom we had named <span id="page-902"></span> Janet. She was born in Mt. Pleasant LDS Hospital and died there from the effects of whooping cough. We buried her in Ephraim the day she was two months old. I had whooping cough at the same time, along with my children. Our son Albert, just older than Janet, was born in Gunnison Valley Hospital while we were living in Ephraim. I don’t believe the Mt. Pleasant Hospital was finished then. My sister Loraine was living with us when our daughter Ann was born (home delivery). Today we have five children married and ten grandchildren. Albert has served in the army in Vietnam and returned home safely, for which we are most grateful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We bought the folks’ old home in Santaquin sometime after Mother’s death and I lived there the winter Ann finished high school, since there was no high school in Wendover. I then went back to live in Wendover for the next year and then  returned to Santaquin for two more winters while Sharon finished high school there. Ivan came home about every other weekend during those winters in Santaquin. However, I only spent a week or two at a time in Santaquin during the summers, putting up fruit, etc. In winters there I served as a Relief Society visiting teacher and also taught in the Primary. I have always loved to read so I read a lot there, crocheted, embroidered and sewed a lot for myself and family. I had to learn to knit to be able to teach the girls in my Primary class - I also taught myself to tat.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have continued to be a Relief Society teacher here in Wendover, as well as to teach in Primary, along with my reading and sewing. Also, I was assigned to take care of the kitchen on Relief Society work meeting days. We usually had potluck but I was required to set the tables and clean up afterwards, with help from other members.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are happy to bring Vera’s history up to date with the word that she has now been serving as Relief Society President in Wendover for about nine months (since Sep. 1968) and that she and Ivan went to the Salt Lake Temple, 11 Oct. 1968, to have their marriage solemnized and four of their ten children who could qualify sealed to them for <span id="page-903"></span> 903 Vera Clark eternity, including the little dead daughter Janet, for whom Vera’s sister Tresia stood. Vera is now preparing to be sealed to her beloved parents and hoping that her sister Alta will join her in this blessing, since they are the only two of the children yet unsealed to them.</p>
