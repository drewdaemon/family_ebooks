  <p class="calibre1">(49) Lucile Christensen (2) tells her own story in what she calls An Autobiography in Brief: “1914-1917 - Baby Years: I was born 17 May 1914 in Pleasant View (North Provo) Utah. My father wanted me named Mette Marie, a Danish name, but Mother prevailed and I was named Lucile. Father was appointed president of Ricks Academy in Rexburg, Idaho and we moved there when I was but a few months old. My recollections of this period are meager - but vivid. A leather clad Indian doll which I loved was taken and chewed up by the rats. We had a large collie dog which, in its playfulness, often knocked me down. My brothers shot a huge snowshoe rabbit which they carried suspended on a stick between them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1917-1931 - Years of Our Migrations: 1917, we were at LaVerkin, Utah at the hot Springs for Edythe’s health and Father’s property speculation. 1918, we were at Hinckley, Utah where father headed the Millard Academy. Here Margaret was born. Luther and I explored the sage covered hills and found a horse caught in barbed wire. Much to Mother’s concern I spent many hours on the respective backs of two mean horses, Fox and Dobbin. I fell from the seat of a disk-plow and cut open my upper lip. 1919, by summer we were living at Star Ranch near Mona, Utah. Father, understanding my insatiable longing for a horse, gave me a little sure-footed mare which I promptly named ‘Queen’. For the full summer I remember no other companion than the beautiful animal on whose back I lived and dreamed. Father called me his ‘Danish Fairy’ and I thrived in the sunlight of this affectionate name until one day, when he took me to Santaquin with him, he pointed out an old bewhiskered man who passed us on the street, by saying, ‘See, that is a Danishman’. Never again for me did ‘Danish Fairy’ call forth the same bright image as before. At Star I had an accident <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-882" title="882"></span>with a razor blade which left me with a four inch scar on my left wrist. We got a victrola which played wonderful music. Something, unknown to me now, happened which caused me to entertain a fear of the dark which has never left me. 1920, during the winter in Provo, Utah, was the flu epidemic. We were all sick, Margaret had pneumonia and Dr. Hassler helped pull her through. 1921, Edythe left for school in Boston. 1923, we moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to a house around which flowed a bend of the Jordan River. Father was sick. I attended Cannon School and Cannon Ward Sunday School. Little sister Margaret was very frank and humiliated me when she told my teacher that we lived down by old Barnhage, the pig man, after I had been describing the beauties of our home by the river. Luther and I discovered a drowned man floating in the river. We also were caught on the Bamburger train bridge. We had just hooked a huge carp and had to abandon it, losing our rod and line as we scampered for our lives before the train. 1924, we were settled in a more comfortable home on 879 South Main Street. I attended McKinley School there. I remember an incident here which touched me. Luther kept a string of muskrat traps in Draper and sold the pelts. One night he had to walk clear from Draper with a skunk pelt because the conductor wouldn’t let him ride the streetcar in his ‘perfumed’ condition. Wendell and Sheldon filled missions and later were married from this home, as Edythe was also. Father took us younger children on several summer trips to California, southern Utah parks and Yellowstone. Mother started a burial clothes business and Luther started to move in the direction of his career as a veterinary doctor. 1930, the house we were renting sold, so we moved nearly to 1740 So. Main, into another large home which Mother, with financial help from Luther, arranged to buy. Mother continued her sewing and also boarded and roomed teachers and secretaries to make our living. Father was sick with diabetes but continued to work and travel trying to make his investments and schemes pay off financially. I attended West High School where I met George F. Tate. I attended South High School my senior year, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-883" title="883"></span>the first year it was built. Father died 17 Dec. 1931.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1932-1938 - Years of Change: For several years I had helped Edythe with her growing family, working on Saturdays and during the summers. I also worked at her husband’s office (Drs. Robbins, Horne and Clawson). In the fall of 1933 I left for Los Angeles to attend the Art Center School, one of the country’s foremost commercial art schools. I studied there until 1936, living the first year at Wendell’s and the last two with Luther and Velda. My summers were spent in Salt Lake City. Edythe’s health was very poor and Mother’s financial burdens were heavy, so it was arranged that Mother would sell the home on Main Street and go to live with and care for Edythe and her five children. When my school was finished and I returned to Salt Lake, I worked as a window designer for Lerner Shops. During the years I had been away, George Tate had been at the Air Corps Technical School at Rantoul, Illinois. We had corresponded quite regularly, in fact carried on a pre-courtship relation which gave us a wonderful opportunity to exchange ideas and feelings. George came home in October of 1937 and after two wonderful weeks of getting to know each other better, we became engaged. When he left to return East, I wrote in a goodbye letter; ‘When I think of eternity with you, it’s none too long a time,’ I have never had reason to feel otherwise. We were married in the Salt Lake Temple by his grandfather, George F. Richards (Pres. of the Quorum of the Twelve) for whom George had been named, 9 Sep. 1938. Three days later we left on a cross-country honeymoon to make our first home in Dayton, Ohio. (George Franklin Tate was born 25 July 1913 in Tooele, Utah, the son of George Lawrence and Alice Minerva Richards Tate).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1938-1944 - Early Ohio Years: These were exciting, growing years with much opportunity for happiness. George progressed to the position of Project Engineer for aircraft engine instruments, and then to Unit Chief in charge of engine instrument development for the Air Force. He traveled extensively in this country and to Alaska. Together <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-884" title="884"></span>we visited New York, Washington D.C., etc. Our two oldest daughters were born here, Kathryn and Barbara, the latter just three days before Pearl Harbor. We were active in church and served as local missionaries together. Our girls were frequently ill. Kathryn developed a tubercle in her lung and the doctors advised us to leave the damp climate and take them to California. We took their advice.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1944-1946 - California Years: We moved to 5242 Alhambra Drive, Woodland Hills, in the hot, dry San Fernando Valley of California. The change worked wonders for our girls and for us also. George was re-employed by the government as Production Engineer in charge of aircraft instruments for the West coast, but after his Wright’s Field experience in Ohio he became restless for more to do and looked around for something more challenging. Soon after moving here our son George was born, I cared for the children and spent much time with Sheldon’s wife Mary, my long-time friend who lived just a few miles away in Tarzana, and with Luther’s wife Velda, also a friend of long standing, who lived in Sherman Oaks. When George found more challenging employment it was with reluctance that we left our home in the Valley and moved to San Lorenzo Village across the bay from San Francisco. George was employed as Project Engineer for the development of a much needed recording instrument for the Air Force. Friden Calculating Machine Co. was his employer. The instrument was completed and under flight test at Wright Field when the war ended. The family now being in good health, George accepted another offer from Wright Field and we moved back to Dayton, Ohio, during the cold winter of 1945/46. During the process of the move, Kathryn fell from a car and sustained a head concussion. She was hospitalized for a week, administered to, and recovered without permanent injury.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1946-1952 - Late Ohio Years: Our new home in Dayton was a large two story frame house from which we attended our Dayton Branch of the church and from which our children attended Jefferson School. The summer after our move <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-885" title="885"></span>our youngest daughter, Susan, was born. Mother Christensen came to care for us, for after Susan’s birth I was laid low with a severe case of mental, physical and spiritual depression which put me back in the hospital and then kept me low after my release. Faith, administrations, and the concerted prayers of the Council of the Twelve, under Grandfather Richard’s guidance, combined to help me. At the time I prayed fervently to the Lord, saying that if he would help restore me to my feet so that I might care for my children and take my responsibilities, I would serve him willingly for the rest of my life. It was a total commitment which He honored. My recovery was rapid, and since that time I have had many opportunities to work in His church. This experience led to greater solidarity and purpose in our lives. The old chapel where we met in Dayton was sold by the church since the neighborhood was rapidly deteriorating and we were meeting at the Miami Hotel. George was Sunday School Superintendent and I was Relief Society President. Later I became District Relief Society President and Branch Primary President at the same time. A new chapel was built and George supervised its erection while I planned its interior decoration. It was completed during 1950-1952. We were busy and happy, but as Kathryn approached her teens we became aware that there were only a few young people in the church there and began to think seriously of moving to Utah where the children would have more opportunity to associate with young people of their own faith.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1952-1958 - Salt Lake Years: In July 1952 we bought Alumatic Door and Window Co. in Salt Lake City from George’s brother, Ralph, and found ourselves deeply engrossed in a new challenge. The next three years brought steady growth but also excessive business demands. We began to feel that we were neglecting our children. With the hope of lessening the strain we brought others into the company and changed it from a partnership into a corporation - but this didn’t work out. After taking some heavy losses we pulled out and formed the George F. Tate &amp; Co. (our present business).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This made it possible for Ralph to assume control of the old business which he had originally started. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-886" title="886"></span>We had built a large rambling brick home in Salt Lake on an acre and a half of creek-side property at 3142 East 3600 South, which we called ‘Westate’. We had hoped it would be our home for many years but it was not to be, for we were inspired and guided to bring our children to Provo the year Kathryn was ready to enter BYU. The decision was made, the home we now live in found, and the younger children registered at BY High, all in a single day. It took us several months to sell our East Millcreek home but nevertheless we moved to 688 North 700 East in Provo for registration the fall of 1958. During the Salt Lake years I had worked quite actively as a free-lance interior designer. I also served in church as Highland View Ward Primary President and then as president of the East Millcreek Stake Primary. I also decorated the Highland View chapel and new East Millcreek Stake center.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1958-1969 - Provo Years: In September of 1958 Kathryn, George and I all registered as Freshmen at BYU. In October of that year I had an offer to travel to Europe to help make decoration suggestions for the Hamburg chapel in Germany, then being supervised by my brother-in-law Burtis F. Robbins, Berlin Mission President. Since I was already committed to commute to Salt Lake twice a week to work with the building committee on the East Millcreek Stake House, and was also registered in school, I was obliged to decline the offer. It had always been my desire that if I ever went to Europe it would be with my husband.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The intervening years have been very full. Kathryn graduated in nursing, Barbara in speech and hearing therapy, Susan in English, and I received my BA degree in English the spring of 1964 and my Masters in English in 1967. During the summer of 1963 I attended the International Language school at Vienna and then Salzburg, Austria. George joined me for the last part of the summer and together we visited Berlin, Denmark and Sweden, flying home to meet Susan and Barbara in New York, following their tour of the New England states. Our son, George Sheldon, served a West German mission (1964-1966) and upon completion of it met Susan in Luxumburg and they toured Europe together. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-887" title="887"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kathryn had spent a summer in Mexico earlier (1959) at the language school there and Barbara, not wanting a foreign trip, had gone to the Hill Cumorah Pageant. Upon completion of Susan’s BA and my Masters degrees, she received a teaching assistantship in Freshman English and I received a full time contract as an instructor of Humanities at BYU (1967). George Sheldon went back to school following his mission and now plans to complete a PhD in comparative literature with an emphasis in languages. He now is doing advanced studies in Latin, German and Norwegian; to these he will add French, Italian and Greek, in addition to Old Saxon, Gothic and French. He then hopes to teach at BYU. Indeed, we are a school family, busy and happy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Now (1969) all three daughters are married and busy raising their families. George Sheldon was just married. George F. has been specializing in genealogy work at BYU in order to become accredited - and he loves it. He is serving as East Provo Stake Mission President. At present I am serving as his companion in this stake mission. Since living in Provo I have also served as Relief Society teacher, counselor in East Provo Stake MIA, and as a decorating consultant on the East Provo Stake Center. The sacred commitment that I made so long ago in Dayton is a life-long promise which I intend always to remember and honor. As a family we look forward with anticipation to many wonderful busy years in worthwhile activities and responsibilities.”</p>
