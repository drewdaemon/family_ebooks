  <p class="calibre1">(37) Farrald DeLong Christensen (1) was born 3 Sep. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Farrald, always modest, writes a little of himself and family:- “I was the last of the family born in Gunnison, I am told; the folks moved to Salt Lake City when I was about nine months oid.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was but a month past his eighth birthday when his father met with his death. Again he writes, “Because mother was alone to raise the family for many years, we had something of a struggle to get along. Roy was working in McGill, Nevada, and for a long time we had no support except what he sent to Mother each month. I managed to get through school, working as I could during the summers. I graduated from the old LDS College (High School) in 1928, then had a couple of sessions at the LDS Business College after that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After jobbing around for several years I went to work for my present employer, the Utah Dept. of Employment Security. I was also busy as a young man in priesthood activities and was in the YMMIA presidency of the Ward for a couple of years. We kept the old family home in Salt Lake until after Mother died.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 17 Oct. 1943 I married Beulah Eliza Nielsen (b. 4 June 1914 in Axtell, Utah to Carl Erastus and Jane Ann Metcalf Nielsen) and we moved into the Stratford Ward in Salt Lake City. Here we lived for twelve years before moving to our present home in Bountiful, Utah. During those twelve years Beulah was active in the Primary Association and I again worked in the YMMIA as one of the presidency, Scout Master and the like. Our church service continued after we moved to Bountiful and again I had various jobs with the Scouts, Explorers, etc., while Beulah, after the children got a little older, worked in the MIA Beehive program for several years. She then went <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-830" title="830"></span> into the Stake as YWMIA secretary, which position she still holds.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Farrald served in World War II in the Navy. He was on a destroyer escort in the Pacific much of the time. He left his wife and children in Salt Lake City, going in Mar. 1944 and returning twenty months later, in November 1946. He was with the U. S. Naval forces which were poised for a gigantic invasion of Japan, when the war ended. This was entirely voluntary service as far as Farrald was concerned, since he was not required to go except by the dictates of his own conscience and his deep sense of patriotism.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He continues his report: “We have four children, all boys: Carl, Beulah’s son by a previous marriage whom I adopted, Leon, Lavon and Gerald Ray. When we finally went to the temple (29 Jan. 1964) all four of the boys went along and were sealed to us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Carl was called on a mission for the church shortly after graduating from Davis High School. He was called to serve in Argentina but was sent at once to Chile where he served in what became the Chilean and then the Andes Mission. Leon graduated from Bountiful High School and attended the University of Utah for two years before accepting a mission call to Denmark. After returning home he went back to the University and graduated. Lavon also graduated from Bountiful High School and attended the University of Utah for two years. He then entered military service and served in Viet Nam with the 4th Infantry. He is now safely home and back at the University. Gerald also finished High School at Bountiful and started college at the U of U. After the first quarter he received a call to the Northern Mexican Mission. He too is home again and back in school at the University.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I myself am now secretary for the High Priests group in our Ward in Bountiful so am not entirely at my ease.” Farrald, upon questioning, admitted he had other hobbies besides his family and the church, mostly “do-it-yourself” projects. We would like to add that he has a great spirit of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-831" title="831"></span> family loyalty which extends far beyond his own immediate family. His two sisters, Pearl and Ivy, live in Salt Lake and he visits them often.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He also visits his brothers, Elmer and Roy, who are out of State on occasions and keeps in touch by phoning them once a month, failing to have success with answers to his letters. Farrald is perhaps the most regular attender of all the members of the Christensen family at funerals of aunts, uncles, cousins and other relatives on all sides. He and Beulah can almost always be found among the mourners in attendance. Though Cousin Byron may run him a close second in this, Farrald is most faithful in paying his respects to our dead and their bereaved families.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Farrald is a tall man and resembles his father more and more to an almost startling degree as the years go by. Though he knew his father for so short a time yet many of his mannerisms are like his, although he is much more quiet in nature. Beulah makes him a fine companion and together they are forging ahead towards the goals they have so wisely set for themselves.</p>
