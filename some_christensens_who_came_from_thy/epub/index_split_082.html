  <p class="calibre1">(36) Virgil Bartholomew Christensen (3) was born 26 Feb. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the home in west Gunnison which is still standing (1969). His wife Elda writes of him:- “Virgil attended grade school and high school (up to a Junior) in Gunnison. When he was about twelve they moved from the big home of his birth to a farm west of Gunnison known as Rocky Point. From here they walked to school, good weather or bad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Virgil’s mother told of him having a bad sick spell when he was very young. It started with ‘summer complaint’ which ran on until they were afraid they would lose him. The doctor said if he did live his mind might be affected. But through prayer and the power of the priesthood he was cured and became a well, healthy child, growing to be the largest of Joseph and Roxie’s family of big sons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Virgil and his brothers had lots of good times along with the hard times. One fall, at duck season, Marvin and he decided to go hunting early so that they would be out and ready to hunt at daybreak. They set the clock and went to bed. When the alarm went off they were up and away. It was cold. They waited and waited for daylight to come but it seemed it never would get light. Virgil said he just couldn’t figure out why it took so long to get light. Finally Marvin admitted that he had set the clock ahead so they’d be sure to be on time. They had been sitting there half the night.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Virgil was past seventeen when his father died in the farm house near Rocky Point, leaving the family in very modest circumstances. Harold <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-826" title="826"></span> and Ruth Ellen had long since left the home and Myron married within the year, leaving him as “man of the house”. He and his mother and two younger brothers, Marvin and Don, tried to make out on Rocky Point for awhile after that, but the fall of 1928 they left and moved to Fayette, some six miles north, to live with his mother’s brother, Uncle Henry Bartholomew, whose wife had recently passed away leaving him with some young children. The arrangement turned out fine for both families. Virgil enjoyed living in Fayette, going with the young folks, attending church, parties and dances.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 12 Nov. 1930 in the county seat at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, he married Elda Jane Hill (b. 27 Aug. 1907 in Fayette to Richard Return and Sarah Jane Bown Hill). They made Fayette their home and here they still reside. Elda takes up the story again:- “Virgil is truck driver by trade - he has been buying trucks all his married life. He has hauled cattle, coal, furniture, taken Boy Scouts and other groups on trips, anything to make ends meet. He has also done road construction work in various places. More recently he has been working for W. W. Gardener in Salt Lake, hauling black top and gravel in the summer and sand and rock in winter. This will be his twelfth year with Gardener.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Virgil is 6 ft. 2 inches tall and weighs 260 lbs. He has blue eyes, not very dark hair - now showing grey - and usually a good natured disposition. He has been and is a fine father and provider. Being very fussy and particular when he does a job, you will know if he builds something it will be straight. He built most of the home we live in and the racks and beds for his trucks, though his present truck has a steel bed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He is honest, and willing to help people out whenever he can; for example, a couple came to our door late one night who were having car trouble. They were from Salt Lake and headed for Phoenix, Arizona. Virgil phoned around to try and find someone to come and fix their car but the garages were all closed and he could find no help. So he told the strangers that they could take his car to Gunnison and get a motel, there being no such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-827" title="827"></span> accommodations in Fayette, and then come back and get their car fixed in the morning. The man turned to him and said ‘Are you a Bishop?’ Virgil laughed and said, ‘Well, I might look the part but I’m not.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He has been a Ward Teacher, Second Counselor in the MIA, and on 3 Dec. 1950 was put in as Second Counselor in the Sunday School Superintendency. On 23 Nov. 1952 he was made First Counselor and held the office for several years, He was also secretary of the Melchizedek priesthood but was released from these duties when he became employed in Salt Lake.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Virgil loves to hunt. He likes to tell about the time, over west of Fayette, when he got into a flock of geese, killing eight - he was so excited about that. He likes to fish, always trying to outdo his boys, which isn’t easy. I don’t believe he has ever missed a deer hunt since he became old enough to go. He always goes up Twelve Mile and all through the years has always gotten his deer. Our youngest son said, ‘I wouldn’t miss that first night of the deer hunt for anything - sitting around the campfire listening to all the deer stories they tell.’ The fall of 1966 there were thirteen men in Virgil’s hunting party and they killed twelve deer - it was most exciting! They put all the deer in one pickup truck and came down the canyon singing and tooting the horns of their cars for all the other hunters to see and hear. They telephoned ahead from Mayfield for their wives to meet them in Gunnison and take pictures of the haul.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We have traveled quite a bit. Virgil went back to Detroit after one of his trucks. He drove to Los Angeles to pick up a load of furniture for a lady and said he liked to never have gotten out of that city. In 1964 we drove to Moab and watched some of the filming of ‘The Greatest Story Ever Told’, currently being shown in local theaters. Then we drove on to see the Arizona Temple at Mesa and the Wax Museum in Scottsdale and other points of interest in Phoenix, etc. In 1965 we traveled to San Diego, Tijuana, Mexico, and visited a daughter in Los Angeles. In 1966 we went to San Francisco and drove over to see the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-828" title="828"></span> Oakland Temple, etc. The spring of 1967 we visited in Oregon and the Northwest. This current spring, 1969, we again took a trip to Oregon to visit our daughter Jean.”</p>
