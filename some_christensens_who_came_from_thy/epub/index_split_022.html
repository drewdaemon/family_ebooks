  <p class="calibre1">Whether it was the forepart of January 1870, as soon as Anne and the new baby were able, or later on that year, when the three families hoisted their belongings into their white-topped wagons and headed south we cannot be quite certain. Early Gunnison Ward records give the following: “Lars (Laurs) M. C. Christensen, son of Christen Christensen and Karen Lauritzen, born 22 July 1847 in Kobberod, Tyland (Thyland) Denmark; bapt. 8 May 1865 by Lars N. Myrup; confirmed same day by same; received Gunnison 1st month 1870.” But Laurs and Else, with their two sons, are recorded as still living in Manti at the taking of the U. S. Census there 25 June 1870. It is possible that Christen and Lars Myrup and their families went along in the early part of the year and Laurs and his family came later on in 1870. Whenever they went that year, however, it was likely with a cow tied to each ox-drawn wagon, and penned up inside somehow some chickens and perhaps a pig, with a few sheep being driven alongside. Picture our Danish kinsfolk as they traveled along thus, varying in ages from 52-year-old Christen and 31-year-old Anne, to two-year-old Caroline and a few-weeks-old Christen. Lars Myrup was pressing 25 and Maren, expecting again soon, was almost 21, while small Mary <span id="page-240"></span> was a year and ten months. Laurs 22 ½ and Else, just short of 23, had two-year-old Christian and seven-month-old Anders to keep contented. Then there were the three girls who were growing up indeed, for Pauline was a young lady of nearly 15, Petrine almost 11 and Nielsine (Sena) 7 ½.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Manti around the Red Point and past Warm Springs to Six Mile, then on to Nine Mile, from thence they continued south, turning west before reaching the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek where it joined the Sanpitch River. Then they wended their way across the meadow road following the course of the Sanpitch as it ran to meet the Sevier River west of Gunnison. Long chains of high hills watched in the distance, craggy crimson peaks jutting sharply at intervals. To the east, towering above the nearby White Hills, were the majestic Wasatch Mountains. Far to the west, lofty blue mountains made a backdrop for grey hills while nearby, a little to the south, stood Chalk Hill with its varying shades of beige, buff and yellow. On all sides were expanses of sage and rabbit brush, denoting the fertility of the soil. So, the Christensens and Myrups came to the little town of Gunnison prepared to sink their roots in the valley and make the most of their inheritance in their “Promised Land”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Gunnison, first settled in 1859, was named in memory of a wonderful friend of the Mormons, Captain John William Gunnison, U. S. topographical engineer, who was killed by Indians near the Sevier Lake in 1853. Captain Gunnison once wrote his observations of the Great Basin and its inhabitants in expressions such as the following: “In these contiguous vales are the gardens of the mountains, located in that remarkable depression styled the Great Basin - out of which no water flows … The atmosphere is light, and breathing is a real luxury. From the canyons the breezes at night are ever fresh and strong… The cheerful, happy faces and the strains of music pouring forth from merry hearts give an impression of a happy society… The ascending sun salutes, and descending bids a short farewell each day, kissing the snow-capt brow of the lofty peeks that look so <span id="page-240a"></span> </p>

  <p class="calibre1">The very first group of settlers coming into Gunnison Valley had settled south of the Sanpitch River where it curved abruptly to the west around Chalk Hill point. The second group who came some months later saw the luxuriant, grassy bottoms between the Sanpitch and the Sevier and so, north and west of the other group, they began a new settlement below a long curve in the Sanpitch and south of little white hill ledge. They called this “Kearns Camp”, “Sevier City Rocky Point” and “Hogwallow” in turn. Their fields were laid out in eighty-acre blocks with roads four rods wide between them. These blocks were then divided into ten acre lots and each settler was allotted his share according to the size of his family. The first temporary shelters were dugouts, usually 12 by 16 feet, made deep in warm mother earth and covered with willows and sagebrush plastered with mud. A fireplace with a chimney sticking tall above the ground was built in one end of each and in the other end a ramp or steps led down to the door or entrance. Nearly all the cooking was done from pots suspended from fireplaces fed by fat pine wood, whose light was a fine substitute for candles. Furniture was made of slabs, poles, split logs or broken wagon boxes. Clothing was sometimes made from tents, sacks or bed ticks, and making over from large to smaller was a common task. Rawhide or buckskin, secured from the Indians, was used for making harnesses, shoes, bed cords and even fences. For mending, leather was used for almost everything including broken wagons and machinery. The work to be done was accomplished cooperatively, making ditches, planting and harvesting crops, making roads and building bridges, cutting, and hauling wood and logs for houses were some of the major jobs to begin with. Soon log cabins were built and then the dugouts became milk cellars and storage pits. The children worked at picking berries, digging sego roots, or gathering succulent weeds to cook as greens. The women sometimes <span id="page-242"></span> sheared the sheep and carded, spun and wove the wool or knitted stockings from it. They made nearly all the family clothing from cloth of their own making. “Do it yourself” projects were the only kind in those days in early Gunnison.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the spring of 1861, Elder Orson Hyde, who was presiding over that area, advised the two groups of settlers to move together. Those from Chalk Hill agreed to move to the lower site. During the winter of 1861-1862 a great amount of snow fell in the mountains and when it melted in the spring the streams and rivers were swollen by it and overflowed their banks in many places. The settlers “turned out en masse and built a dam” to divert the water away from their homes and keep it from swallowing up the colony. Nevertheless, the ground became soaked and soggy, cellars filled with water, chimneys fell down, and the whole place became nothing much but a “hog-wallow”. When President Brigham Young and his company came through there by ox-train that September, he was shocked by the condition of the land and advised the Saints to move east onto the bench and there build a permanent city to be called “Gunnison.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Without delay the new townsite was laid out in eight-acre oblong blocks, with wide roads between - 24 regular blocks and 54 fractions. Main Street (now Center Street) ran east to above town and west to Second West, then North. Before winter set in some families had already moved to the new location and by the summer of 1863 all fifty families of which the place boasted had taken up their new residences. All public buildings from “the hollow” were moved onto the bench, including the meeting and school house which had been dedicated on Christmas Day 1861. Built of logs which had been sawed through at Lewis Bunce’s mill, and whitewashed on the inside with clay from Chalk Hill, this 20 by 40 ft. room, with a door between two windows on one side, spacious rock chimneys at each end, a floor of boards, together with benches of slabs and a pine wood table, not only served for church and school in its new location, but dancing and festivals as well. <span id="page-243"></span> In May or June 1866 word was sent from Brigham Young for the Gunnison settlers to move their cabins in line for outside walls of a fort. No sooner said than begun. Four blocks, numbers 13, 14, 20 and 21 (with the middle intersection at today’s 2nd West on Center Street) were enclosed. Walls between the cabins were rocked up to a height of seven feet with peepholes near the top. At each corner circular structures with many peepholes served as lookouts for the watchmen. There was a substantial gate on each side in line with the cross streets. A standing guard was maintained night and day. West, on Rocky Point, a great pile of straw was heaped up ready for firing as a warning should any red men be sighted. Boys too young to stand guard ran errands and carried food and water to the men on duty. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the spring of 1867, when the Indians renewed their shocking brutality, all of the settlements on the Sevier River south of Gunnison had been evacuated and many of the evacuees were welcomed to Fort Gunnison, though some chose other settlements farther north. The people from the area of Fayette to the north moved their log cabin homes into Gunnison Fort also. At this time President Brigham Young advised the building of a more substantial fortification at Gunnison. Militiamen at once commenced work on what was designed to be a splendid structure, surrounding the fort and enclosing twelve city blocks. The two-story northeast tower of rock, circular in form, reached a height of about thirteen feet, the tapering walls of which, four feet thick at the base, had small openings to shoot through. This fortification was never finished, for the need for it subsided before it could be fully accomplished. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Settlers came from both north and south to Fort Gunnison and as they came, they were welcomed and room provided for them, even houses built. Many of the military from the north were stationed there from time to time. A few stories that have come down to us from life in Gunnison Fort would not be amiss here. “After a few weeks living within its walls, a letter was sent to President Wells (head of the Mormon Battalion in Utah) <span id="page-244"></span> asking permission to have the ‘Kraals’, Pig Stys and sheep pens outside the fort to keep it from becoming disagreeably unsanitary”, which was granted we suppose. Albert Tollestrup’s diary contains these excerpts: “We children would go through the big gate down to Sanpitch River just one block away. With pin hooks and thread lines we fished for minnows. We brought some home to fry but we also ate some raw Injun fashion. ‘Sunflower Hole’ and ‘Big Roundy’ were swimming holes close by and a mile west of Rocky Point was ‘Izen Glass Hole’ where we caught water snakes and blue racers. In a puddle nearby there was good clay out of which we made horsemen and Indians and put them on the rocks to dry. It was fun to climb to the top of ‘picket guard’ on Rocky Point. We could see the Sevier River, the White Hills, and all over town and away to Fayette, Willow Creek and Salina.” “When Hans C. Hansen was a small child, he was playing alone outside the fort walls one day. An Indian picked him up and took him to his lodge. Hans’ mother saw the Indian take him and followed anxiously after them. When she reached the wickiup the Indian was giving Hans a pair of moccasins. Luckily the Indian was a friendly one and she was able to take the boy and hurry home. Hans liked the moccasins and was allowed to keep them.” Sometimes people were not so fortunate. White children were occasionally stolen and never found; at other times they were kidnapped by the Indians and redeemed after a lapse of time in payment for food, blankets and anything the minds of the red men could think up.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the early spring of 1869, the Gunnison people moved their cabins out of the fort and onto their own city lots, set out fruit trees, planted gardens and started many improvements in an effort to beautify their abodes. In April they decided to start a co-op store in the settlement. ZCMI in Salt Lake City had merchandise available for such projects, so Bishop Horne went north to get a load of goods. When he returned there was much excitement in the town, but the little house or store wasn’t ready for the wares, so they were sold from the wagon. In two days, the store building was ready, but the goods had all <span id="page-245"></span> been sold, so the Bishop went to Salt Lake for another load. Other peacetime projects were planned and a committee worked out the following seven point program: “(1) Division of the wire grass bottoms, a lot to each family; (2) A system of irrigation where needed and drainage for flag-grass areas; (3) A schedule of labor to accomplish the work; (4) Burning of old grass; (5) Survey of lots and leveling of ditches; (6) Fencing; (7) Sowing of improved red-top seed.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Upon taking up their residence in Gunnison, Laurs and Else and their two small children were eventually assigned a lot on what is now (1969) about the end of Third West on First South. Soon a small adobe house facing south was erected there and later plastered white on the outside. (It is still standing today.) Laurs must have also been given some grazing land in the “bottoms” for his stock, as well as some farming land somewhere on which to begin planting. Assignments of labor for him in that cooperative society, however, were definitely not relegated to the days ahead but must have been given right away and started as soon as his family had been made reasonably comfortable. It is supposed that the grubbing of brush and clearing of his own acres was not long delayed either. There is indication that Christen Christensen and Lars Myrup were given lots in east Gunnison. Thus, these and other Scandinavian immigrants, who in general had been reckoned to be rather poor pioneers, settled down to become fine grassroot settlers in the valleys of the mountains.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the summer of 1870 Hans Thunnison, postmaster of Gunnison, sent the following report to the Deseret News in Salt Lake City: — “We have but a small settlement of 90 families. The grasshoppers preyed heavily upon us the last years. The losses sustained from them and the burdens we have had to endure during the Black Hawk War were equally severe - but we are improving. Our fields at present look barren and desolate except about 250 acres planted mostly with late wheat which looks very promising and will, we hope, suffice to feed the inhabitants of this place for the <span id="page-246"></span> coming year, with the addition of peas, potatoes, corn, etc., all of which appear to be doing well. A new rock schoolhouse, 24 x 24 feet, will soon be finished. With the good road now made up Twelve Mile Canyon we expect a good supply of lumber. The people seem to be well generally, the weather is fine and as soon as the grasshoppers get wings they take their fight to other parts.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Time and events must have passed swiftly for the Christensens and Myrups in Gunnison the next few years, for when people are well and working busily towards desired goals and succeeding to some extent it is hard to keep track of the minutes as they fly. Additions to the three families seemed to have come along as fast as anything. On 1 March 1870 Maren gave birth to her first son. He was a tiny little fellow and they named him Lars Christian Myrup after his father. (Later they changed his name to Louis). A little more than a year later, 7 March 1871, Else presented Laurs with his third son and they named him for the Prophet Joseph. His hair was curly like his father’s and grandfather’s and also like his brother, Christian’s, though he was lighter complexioned than Christian. March 29, 1872, Maren had another son whom they named Niels Christian Myrup, also for his father whose full name was Lars Christian Nielsen Myrup. Not to be outdone, Anne presented Christen with another son on 26 April 1872. They gave him the name of John Taylor Christensen in honor of the Apostle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the late autumn of 1871, Laurs and Else made their first trip back to Salt Lake City. It must have taken at least a week each way, for although Gunnison was only 1491 miles from Salt Lake at the time, travel, with roads like they were, was pretty slow even with a good team of horses. Too, they had to stop along the way to camp at nights, as well as other times to rest, water and feed their animals, carrying that feed along with them, and to prepare their own victuals or “grub”, the makings of which they also took along stowed away in grub boxes likely under the seat of the wagon. Did they take along their sons Christian, just turned four, Andrew two years and <span id="page-247"></span> four months, and seven-month-old Joseph? ‘Tis most likely that they did and also that they were accompanied by a number of other wagon loads of Saints, since it was still not considered entirely safe to travel alone or in a small group, for fear of Indians.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The main purpose of this trip, as far as Laurs and Else were concerned, was to enjoy the great privilege of going to the Salt Lake Endowment House and being sealed as man and wife for time and all eternity. This sacred event took place 30 October 1871. There in Salt Lake City just prior to this, or on 28 October, Laurs was ordained an Elder in the LDS Church. No sealings of children to parents could be rightly performed until temples were prepared in Utah to take care of those and other holy ordinances. After having been sealed in the Endowment House Else and Laurs, if they remained true to the covenants made at that time, would be considered worthy to partake of other blessings in the House of the Lord, when one should be provided, such as having their three first born sealed to them for all eternity and also to have the holy ordinances of baptism, endowment and sealing done for their dead relatives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else must have been forcefully reminded of this latter obligation when she received word of her mother’s death sometime after it occurred. Mette Kirstine Christensdatter (Hvid) died 11 July 1872 in Norhaa, Thisted, Denmark at the age of 61 years, 3 months and 8 days. However, there is some indication that correspondence and communication between her and her loved ones in the old country was not carried on regularly, in fact hardly at all, until many years after her mother’s passing. Else’s heart must have yearned to see her father and comfort him then, but she was helpless to go. Surely though she wrote her family words of love and consolation - and wept betimes in longing to be near them in their mutual sorrow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In that year of 1872 another uprising of Indians threatened, particularly in Sanpete. Several Utah Indian Chieftains were taken to Washington, D. C. to meet with United States <span id="page-248"></span> President Ulysses Simpson Grant, where they must have promised that the uprisings would cease, for they did, in Utah at least, from then on. Yet notwithstanding the possible danger from redmen, and doubtless leaving their two small sons with Else or Anne, Lars and Maren Myrup left Gunnison that midsummer and traveled to Salt Lake City by team and wagon. There in the Salt Lake Endowment House, 15 July 1872, they had their endowments and were sealed together for time and eternity. These holy ordinances were so important to the majority of the early Saints that they were willing to sacrifice a great deal to have them accomplished. Lars Myrup was fast becoming a man of some consequence in the community of Gunnison. He had a way with people, especially the Scandinavian brothers and sisters who looked to him for leadership.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, 13 December 1872, Else Christensen gave birth to her fourth son. He was the first of their children to be born under the covenant and their first and only “winter” baby. He and Joseph were each born in the small adobe house on First South, Third West. They had this fourth son, Albert Christen Christensen, blessed and named by Bishop Joseph S. Horne, 2 January 1873.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen’s eighteen-year-old daughter, Pauline, was wed to Andrew Andersen of Gunnison, also a native of Denmark, 12 May 1873. Their endowments were had and their marriage consumated in the Salt Lake Endowment House. He was nearly seven-and-a-half years older than she. That same year, railroad building in Utah took a spurt. By 25 November, the Utah Southern Railroad had reached as far south as Provo, where a great celebration was held that day. A railroad in a town ended its semi-isolation and made easy contact with the outside world available—thus there was cause for rejoicing. Railroad building was also a boon to the settlers in other ways, increasing their incomes through contracts getting out lumber for ties, etc., as well as for opportunities to labor on the projects outright.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else Kathrine always had an intense love for education which is indicated in her son Albert’s <span id="page-249"></span> account of her given in his autobiography, from which we quote: “… As soon as arriving in the United States she set about to learn to read English, and while it was difficult to learn the language, she succeeded in being able to read and understand it in a very short time. Needless to say, she was exceedingly energetic in assuming the household responsibilities, but aside from that she always took an independent interest in public matters, and especially in the health of the people in the community and in the education of her children. The two older boys were taught early to read so that when they first attended school, they were able to commence in what was then called ‘the third reader’. After her general housework was done she usually engaged in carding and spinning, and each day the children took their turns at the side of the spinning wheel and had their lessons in reading. While she was unable at first to pronounce the words so that in that way she was not only the teacher, but was also taught the pronunciation of English words. This love of education and improvement was one of her outstanding characteristics.” The women all helped each other according to their special talents. Cheerful cooperation made the many working bees - sewing, quilting, rug-making, apple drying, squash drying, corn husking, etc., - into social events. Else was an excellent mixer for she was always sympathetic and willing to “go the extra mile”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christensen family clothing was mostly fashioned from cloth of her own making or that was exchanged for sick duty and such. Excellent trousers for little boys could be made from seamless sacks and straw hats by picking out the finest straw, soaking it in water until it could be braided and then shaped over a pot or bowl to dry. Most small children were scantily dressed in summers and ran without shoes. Hand-loomed and hand-sewn clothing lasted a long time and could be passed down, or made over, sometimes for generations. Women’s shoes were often made from any coarse cloth that they could find. Some were fortunate enough to procure leather moccasins from friendly Indians for a bit of wheat or flour. Brigham Young once told the early settlers that if <span id="page-250"></span> they would wear wooden-soled shoes most would be free from rheumatics, or “rheumatiz”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Laurs first came to the valley he had gotten down to nothing but white shirts and had been forced to wear them to work in until more practical ones could be made for him. Thus, he gained for himself the title “Chris of the White Shirt”. He was a hard worker, steadfast, dependable and so very honest. Though naturally a somewhat quiet man, he possessed a happy disposition and a natural wit and sense of humor that helped to pull his family over many rough places along the way. He was extremely unselfish and gentle and kind - oh so kind! He never struck one of his children in anger and gave them but very little unnecessary advice. He was immaculate in his personal habits. He had a fine mind and was conservative and deliberate in his decisions and very practical, though at times he may have seemed a little slow in making up his mind. Indeed, Laurs was a splendid balance for a wife such as Else who was sometimes impetuous, impractical and determined - yet withal gifted with great vision, faith and dreams by which she oft was guided. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">The year 1874 was full of experiences both good and bad for the families in Gunnison and the church in general. On 16 July Anne gave Christen another son whom they named Andrew, the same as Laurs’ and Else’s second. 24 August, Maren had her third son and they named him Adolph Marinus Myrup. So now Anne and Maren each had one daughter followed by three sons, while Else had four sons but no daughters. That she longed for a girl child is easy to believe. July was remarkable for much lightning, thunder and rainstorms. Winds of hurricane proportions belted the area causing much damage and some severe fires.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was increased anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy movements in Zion and an anti- Mormon weekly newspaper, “Utah Scandinav” began publication in the Danish-Norwegian language that October but was forced to discontinue after three years run. There were numerous excommunications from the church. But, on the other hand, many Indians were converted and baptized into the church that <span id="page-251"></span> year - whole tribes in fact. On July 24th a grand “Juvenile Jubilee” in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City where 4,000 young musicians and singers participated to celebrate the pioneers’ entrance into the valley some twenty-seven years before. Work on Utah’s first temple was pushed forth with vigor in St. George. One of the most far-reaching and important events of the year, however, was the introduction and organization of the “United Order” principle which took place at the 44th Annual Conference of the Church in Salt Lake City in the forepart of April.</p>
