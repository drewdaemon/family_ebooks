  <p class="calibre1">(29) Clifton Christensen Bartholomew (5) according to the account of him in his mother’s Book of Remembrance: “was born 24 Nov. 1906 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. He was blessed there by his grandfather, Bishop John Bartholomew. The following spring his parents bought a large new brick home in Gunnison, Utah (1907) where they moved when he was but a few months old.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At age six Clifton entered the Gunnison public school. On his eighth birthday, 24 Nov. 1914, he was baptized by Joseph W. Vickers in the Manti Temple and was confirmed the same day and place by Martin Jenson. When he was four months past nine he left Gunnison by train, along with his mother and brothers and sisters, for Lyman, Wyoming and settled on a ranch six miles east living there in summers and attending school in winters for the next two years. In the spring of 1918 he moved with his parents and family to Ogden, Utah. Here, aside from attending school, etc., he mowed lawns for people and sacked kindlings at the kindling factory. He returned to Lyman, Wyoming for the next school year (1919/20) and then went to Goshen, Utah with the family the spring of 1920, living on the Boswell farm two miles south of Goshen. He finished Jr. High School <span id="page-803"></span> in Goshen and then went by bus to Payson, Utah where he attended High School.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Clifton was ordained a Deacon in the church 1 Apr. 1919 by William Spangenberg in Ogden, and a Teacher 25 Mar. 1923 by Robert E. Finch in Goshen. On 24 Apr. 1926 he left for Florida and worked in electrical work until Sep. 1927. After a short interval at home he started to work for the Power and Light Company around Austin and Round Rock, Texas, and stayed there until about July 1928. He then worked for the Bingham Canyon Copper mine till December that same year and then went back to Texas, working around Ft. Worth and Waco for the Texas Power and Light and Texas Electric Service Company. In October of 1929 he was working at El Paso, Texas for the El Paso Electric Co. From there he went to Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, and worked there until September of the next year. During the year 1931 he worked for Walker Mine in California, then in 1932 went to work at Boulder Dam. Later he worked for Tintic Standard Mine near Dividend, Utah, and then for Utah Power and Light Co. in Provo Canyon and Park City. In 1936 he worked at Pioche and Las Vegas, Nevada, until just before getting married to Rhea Wilson. After this he went to work for an electric company in California, living at various places such as Montebello, Alpine and Whittier.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clifton wrote a bit about himself and we quote:— “In 1926 my brother Edgar and I went to Miami, Florida, to work for a power company. We were there in the hurricane of Sep. 1926 when so many lives were lost and so much damage occurred. After about 18 months in Florida we went to Texas where we worked for a Texas utility company that was building lines to service a large oil pipeline going to the Eastern States. Two years later we went to Merida, Yucatain, Mexico, to work for the Electric Bond and Share Co. until the depression stopped all work there. I worked on the Hoover (Boulder) Dam while it was being built.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I married Rhea Hazel Wilson of Payson, the girl from across the street, 17 June 1937 in Salt Lake City, Utah. (She was born 7 Nov. 1913 in Eureka, Utah to Robert Henry and Zelpha Nisonger <span id="page-804"></span> Wilson). We went to Los Angeles, Calif. where I went to work for the Southern California Edison Company. During World War II I went with Lockheed  Overseas Corporation to Ireland where we stationed at an Air Force base in Northern Ireland near Belfast (July 1943-July 1944). In Aug. 1944 I went back to work for the Edison Company, this time in Redlands, Calif., where I have worked for the past twenty-four-and-a-half years.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In December 1945 Clifton and Rhea moved into their own home at 812 Sherwood St., Redlands, Calif., where they still reside. At last report Rhea was serving as a counselor in the Relief Society presidency of their Ward. She says she is having problems tracing her genealogy. They have no descendants.</p>
