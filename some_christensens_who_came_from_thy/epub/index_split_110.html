  <p class="calibre1">(64) Lorraine Clark (9) was born in Goshen, Utah County, Utah 14 Nov. 1926. She was three and a half when the family moved to Santaquin nearby. It was in Santaquin that she received most of her formal education and where she graduated from Junior High. It has been stated that she was always one of the top students in her classes, if not the top one. In her ninth grade year she was honored by being chosen May Day queen of the school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She started High School in Payson but quit early in her first year to go to work, as some of the other children in her family had done, to provide  themselves with “the extra things” for which young people yearn and for which there was very little money available in their home, although it was rich in love, sacrifice and devotion. Though her father was a laboring man with a limited education,  and the family was large, yet her parents did all they possibly could to raise healthy, wholesome,  happy children. Actually, Lorraine and her brothers and sisters had a wonderful heritage, having come from purebred English and Danish stock. All of their four grandparents were courageous  emigrants who left their homes in their native lands and came to Zion for the Gospel’s sake.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lorraine had an opportunity to go to Delta, Utah to work for her cousin, Ada P. Johnson, and a lovelier person than Ada was hard to find. Lorraine worked at her place for at least a year, helping with the house and children. From Delta Lorraine went to Ephraim, Utah and lived with her married sister, Vera, and family. By then the war was on and a parachute plant had been opened in nearby Manti. Good wages could be made there and they “bussed” workers from the surrounding towns, so she got a job there. Vera writes:- “Lorraine came and stayed with me when I lived in Ephraim. She was at our home when our daughter Ann was born (18 Sep. 1943). She started working at the sewing plant in Manti and stayed with me a year or so and quit at the sewing plant and went to Salt Lake to work. She had sewed since she was a young girl and was a lovely seamstress.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lorraine’s sister Tresia writes:- “I was <span id="page-959"></span> living with the Hughes Brockbank family in Salt Lake City and working part time. They needed a girl and I wrote Lorraine and she came and worked at Brockbanks’ for at least a year. I stayed with her in their home until I got married (23 Oct. 1945). Later she worked with our sister Alta at Monson’s Nursing Home.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When a sewing plant, the Barbizon Company, started business in Provo, Utah in March 1946 Lorraine went to work there. But it was while living in Salt Lake City that she met her future husband. Alta introduced them. She was married the day after her twentieth birthday, 15 Nov. 1947, in Elko, Nevada to Forest Abel Craig (b. 24 Feb. 1927 in Palisade, Colorado to Forest Oscar and Annabelle Frances Houseman Craig).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia again writes:- “Abel and Lorraine built a small home on a piece of property his parents owned just off Redwood Road and about Tenth South. Their daughter Kathy was born there a year or two later. When she was about six or seven they sold that home and bought a nice home on 1067 Sterling Drive in the Rose Park area in Salt Lake. Abel was a plumber and became very successful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Lorraine and Kathy were very active in their new ward. Lorraine sang in the ward choir and taught Kathy’s Sunday School class. She gathered Ward Budget for years, She loved working  in her yard. She sewed for herself and Kathy and kept her looking like a princess. She was so proud of this lovely daughter of theirs and so much of her life was wrapped up in her.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lorraine started working at Mode O’ Day in Salt Lake City about 1949 and worked there off and on as a seamstress for about fifteen years. She became well liked there by both the employees and  the management. In fact she was shown many special favors and in her sweet, innocent way accepted them gratefully yet perhaps with a little pride, for she was not entirely free from vanity like most other pretty girls. But through this, jealousy began to rear its ugly head in the sanctity of their home. <span id="page-960"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Through the emotional impact of this Lorraine became very ill and was forced to give up her work. She became entirely discouraged. She was sent to the Mental Hospital in Provo for treatments. They could find little wrong with her but sheer despondency. She seemed to gain strength from the treatments and was able to return home but failed to find there the understanding and encouragement  she needed so badly at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime, Abel was prospering in his trade. Lorraine was presented with a divorce summons  she was unable to understand or answer. Abel procured an easy divorce and soon re-married. Their daughter Kathy, a sweet girl with a charming personality, remained with her mother and this was Lorraine’s “star of hope” for the future. But somehow  Kathy’s loyalties began to change. Her Aunt Tresia writes:- “Kathy turned against her mother and sided in with her father. I think she was really led to believe that her mother had done some terrible sin - but except for being a little foolish and vain, Lorraine had done no sin.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia continues: - “I have never known a family who so many people envied and thought they had everything. I also have never known a family who sank into the depth of despair as they did. Their lives have shown me that the material things aren’t what count, and that the only way to find true happiness is by keeping and living the commandments  of our Heavenly Father. I’m sure Lorraine desired  these things. But she had lost her husband and she  felt that she had also lost her precious daughter  and she just didn’t have the courage to go on.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Undoubtedly with little knowledge of the seriousness of the act, Lorraine took her own life at her home in Salt Lake City, 31 Aug. 1967. Desiring so much the tranquility and peace she could not seem to find in life, she probably never looked back once she decided on her course. Who knows? A lovely memorial service was held for her Wed. Sep. 6 at 11:00 a.m, in the ward chapel, at which the Bishop and others who knew her eulogized  her loveliness, humility, love of humanity and desire to serve. Her body was laid to rest later <span id="page-961"></span> that day by the side of her parents in the cemetery at Goshen, Utah County, Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In speaking of her, her sister Tresia  adds:- “Lorraine was one of the best housewives I have ever known. Her house was always clean, nice meals cooked. She always kept Kathy clean and looking like a doll. She loved working in her yard. Truly she excelled in most of her undertakings. Her husband said of her after they were divorced, ‘In the sixteen or seventeen years we lived together before our trouble began, as a wife and mother I could find no fault in her. I could paint any room in the house, move anything out - stove,  refrigerator - without cleaning first. Everything was clean.’”</p>
