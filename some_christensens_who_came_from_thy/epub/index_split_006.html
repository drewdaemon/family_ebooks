  <h2 id="there-is-a-lovely-land" class="calibre9">THERE IS A LOVELY LAND</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The title for this chapter, about the birth-land of our cherished progenitors, was borrowed from the pen of Adam Ochlenachlager, Denmark’s National Poet, who wrote one of this country’s national anthems and called it by that name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">DENMARK—A sea-washed kingdom of some 500 green islands (483 to be exact) 100 of them inhabited the others not; and thrown in for good measure, a ragged-coasted head-and-neck of land jutting northward from Germany, called the Jutlandic Peninsula, or “Jutland”. (It was in Denmark’s Jutland, the most northwestern part sometimes called Thyland or “Thy”, that our Danish Christensens were born.) Denmark, the smallest of the Scandinavian countries and Europe’s smallest kingdom, is often called “Little Denmark”. Her total land area is 16,576 square miles—about twice the size of our State of Massachusetts. There is nothing particularly spectacular about the land itself except for some dazzlingly white chalk cliffs, the so-green of its ever-green islands, and the unusual sculpturing of its varying coastline, 4,620 miles in length. The terrain is mostly gently rolling with some woods and hilly areas, particularly in Jutland, where the highest point, “Heaven Mountain”, reaches upward about 600 feet; which may seem insignificant to “Rocky Mountain folks” but is undoubtedly quite impressive to low-land Danes when viewed from a valley two feet below sea level. The country is <span id="page-2"></span> totally surrounded by sea, except where Jutland’s broad neck joins Germany, and broken apart by numerous water courses the three largest being the “Sound”, “Great Belt” and “Little Belt”. As if these weren’t enough, the surface is so studded with lakes, coves, bays, canals and fjords that one wonders how any land has been able to survive at all amidst all that water! But the pleasant land is there nevertheless, holding up its proud head above the ever-lapping of the hungry sea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark, primarily a farming kingdom, devotes 75% of the land to agriculture and 9% to forestry, while 8% is occupied by moors and dunes, with most of the remainder being built up into villages and cities, large cities being comparatively few in number. There is no mineral wealth but the soil is fertile and, as reported in 1950, produces three times as much grain per acre as is grown in the U. S. A. The climate is a study in extremes, with the long snows of its dark winters and the “shimmering half-light-at-midnight” of its short but bright summers. There is always wind, particularly in northwestern Jutland, fierce off the cruel North Sea in winters, caressing in summers—but wind enough to turn a mill or lift a sail any day. But it is not the formation nor the performance of the land that beckons and invites one to these faraway shores. The great charm of the “Little Kingdom of Denmark” lies in the people who possess her: their character, their customs, the manner in which they have dressed the land; and also—and perhaps to an even greater extent—to the colorful history of her past, reminders of which can be seen all around the land today.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Danish people, subjects of a constitutional monarchy since 1849, are at present about 4,500,000 in number. In the neighborhood of 26% of these live by agriculture, 32% by industry, and a good part of the remainder by fishing, shipping, handicrafts and tourist service (this latter growing each year). This was not so in earlier Denmark, when most everyone lived by farming and fishing and a few by trade.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Even the richest nobles maintained close contact with the soil, as well as with shipping. The country is far more commercialized today, although <span id="page-3"></span> agriculture is still the backbone of its economy. Though the Danes export many products, such as porcelain, linen, glassware, silver, furniture, fish, etc., their milk, butter, cheese, ham and eggs, all products of their specialized agriculture, are the most important. They help to feed Europe and some even find their way into American kitchens. Even though they export the best of their dairy products, the Danes eat well and are likely the best fed European peoples today. They are not wealthy (there are comparatively few millionaires in Denmark) but they attain comfort if they fall short of: riches. These people are fairly well educated, since Denmark is one of Europe’s best instructed countries; there is no illiteracy there. Compulsary education, introduced in 1814, was reinforced thirty years later by Bishop Grundtvig’s famous “Folk High Schools”, which still exist. These aim to train adult students in the literature, history, georgraphy and culture of their own land, and also in the art of living. Many Danes can speak English (or think they can).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the far-east coast of the island of Zealand lies the city of Copenhagen, of “Kobenhavn”, mean- ing merchants-haven. It was a small fishing and trading village until 1536, when it became capitol of the realm. Now one of Europe’s loveliest capitols and a center of culture for all Scandinavian peoples, it is also Denmark’s largest city by far, housing nearly one-fourth of her entire population, including the present Danish King Frederick IX and the royal family. Copenhagen is situated on a beautiful harbor, over which presides Denmark’s finest bronze statue, “The Little Mermaid” sitting on her rock, a docking place for multitudes of great and small ships and crafts of all kinds, bringing in products from all over the world. But Copenhagen, despite her growing cosmopolitan leanings and her accumulation of much that is geared to the tastes of ultra modern sophisticates, is still very much of a Danish city, with her old spires, towers, statues, palaces, churches, bridges, and harbor canals—some dating to the Renaissance. With typical Danish ingenuity the Danes have managed to maintain here, as elsewhere in their land, the image of ‘Old Denmark”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-4"></span> Danish men and Danish women are not easily swayed or changed; they seldom lose their identity or their moorings. This seems to be one of their outstanding characteristics. They go about their business with cool-headed confidence in themselves and their country. They give the impression that they know where they are going and how to get there! Obviously, Danes are not all alike; but though there are numerous classifications and varieties, there seems to be only one name-brand: “Deep Down Danes”. They cling to their land, their homes and families, their friends, their purposes and traditions with a steadfastness that is gratifying in this fly-by-night age. However, it would be a mistake to think of them as a somber people—they are anything but that. They are best known for their gaiety and hospitality. Any harshness of their lives is well cushioned with that rare Danish humor for which they are so famous. It is easier to think of the Danes as one big family rather than a nation; for of all the European peoples they seem to be the most domestic, friendly and uncommonly happy - and especially so out in the countryside.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And how the Danish people, one and all, love to celebrate! Every holiday or special occasion calls for a “festival”; their lives are literally punctuated with them: family festivals, village festivals, State festivals; festivals for birthdays, confirmations, gold and silver wedding anniver- saries, etc., as well as house-warmings. Not only is there a festival when the new house is first occupied but even before, when the rafters are raised and the roof newly placed, they fly a Danish flag from tip-top, put a wreath around its pole and “raise the roof and rafters” all over again! Each family party includes everyone from Grandma to baby. With each new festival out come the flags, the garlands, the open-faced sandwiches, the coffee and pastries, as well as plenty of good old Danish beer. People make verses, songs and toasts to the celebrated and there is as much good cheer passed around as refreshments. What matters if present day celebrations are not as meaningful as those of yore, as long as there are festivals? The Danes’ summers are brief and they <span id="page-5"></span> enjoy them to the hilt; everyone moves outside, The land itself takes on the appearance of a gigantic festival, with flags flying, bands playing, and flowers blossoming everywhere: heather on the moors of Jutland; tulips, vari-colored, on the island of Funen; potted plants in cottage windows; cemeteries, hedged all around, purple with pansies; flowers massed brilliantly in parks and gardens; balconies bright with blooms on city dwellings; wreaths and garlands twined everywhere at the least provocation; red poppies in the fields of Slesvig and, mingled gaily with all, the flowered caps of girls. It would be hard to think of Den- mark without flowers or flags and it would be equally difficult to think of her without bells. So often there have been bells ringing in Denmark from spires and towers: carillons, bells to mark the hours and to call the congregations to worship; happy peel of bells for weddings, mournful toll of bells for dyings; clang of bells calling her sons to battle—Denmark has had her share of wars. Flowers are for summers, but bells and flags are for all seasons in this lovely land of the Danes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Danish citizens are patriotic too, displaying their national banner at every conceivable opportunity and standing, heads uncovered, in city squares; singing with gusto as bands play “King Christian”, “Lovely Land”, or others of their country’s songs; but it goes far beyond that. The Danes seem to have sincere affection for their homeland and a deep sense of national pride, especially in the storied achievements of Denmark’s venerable past. They are proud of their descent from the bold Vikings of old who roamed the seas a thousand years ago, though they themselves are as peaceable as those marauding pirates of the sea were fierce. How well these Danish people know the legends and sagas of their native land, passed down for generations and told them in their youth. Who know or cares where fact takes flight and fantasy begins? Have you heard them tell how their land got its name? Denmark, or “Danmark” as the Danes have it, means Dan’s Field and was so named about 900 A.D. after the mythical Danish champion Hoger Dansker—“who has been seated asleep for age after age, till the day of fate <span id="page-6"></span> awakens him, but whose beard has continued to grow until it has grown right through the board (table) where he sits”. (There is a statue of him and his whiskers in Copenhagen.) Or perhaps you have heard some tell of Denmark’s flag, “Dannebrog”, meaning Danes-piece-of-cloth—“blood-red with cross of white, it came dropping out of heaven 20 June 1219, when the elderly Danish Archbishop, Anders Sunesen, fell on his knees on a hill during the Battle of Lyndanisse and prayed for victory— just the way Moses had done.” They speak of the “Three Year War” a century ago, to save Jutland’s neck, Slesvig, from the German Holsteiners and of the miracle that happened down there on the blood-drenched fields; of how every spring then the red poppies bloomed with white crosses. Such tales are a rich part of Denmark’s heritage, as are the stories and folk-ballads of her kings and queens, nobles and peasantry, wars, fleets, and of the land itself, that reach back-back-back, for Denmark counts her years in thousands instead of hundreds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is magic in recalling the dignified glory of her past, as told in song and stone artifacts, myths and sagas; especially if one’s roots were sprouted and nurtured on her soil for genera- tions, when the spark of one’s own life was even then within the veins of her ancient peoples. Surely the liveliest interest and the most human should be awakened in us of Danish descent, in this tie of blood and place—this small corner of the earth to which chance brought our ancestors. Someday, if one were fortunate enough to find himself contemplating the story of Denmark’s ancient towns, fields and peoples spread out before his very eyes—in ramparts of long-idle fortresses; settlements of stone age men; Viking graveyards and remains of “long ships” in which these fierce ones raided; picturesque old castles, monasteries and cathedrals where storks have built their nests for ages; magnificent palaces dating to 1600 and beyond, containing royal tombs, crown jewels and treasures of ancient kings; low-thatched and timbered cottages, the like of which inspired the fairy tales of that famous story teller, Hans Christensen Andersen, —cottages to which the atmosphere of fairyland still clings; <span id="page-7"></span> or if one were to find himself standing in the ancient city of Nyborg beside Denmark’s last surviving Royal Medieval Castle, where her “Magna Charta” (Royal Charter) was drawn up and proclaimed in 1282—might not one, with surge of deep emotion, be led to exclaim in wonderment: “Were my kinsmen here?”</p>
