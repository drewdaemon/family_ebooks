  <h2 id="florence-lafaun-christensen" class="calibre9">Florence LaFaun Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(12) Florence LaFaun Christensen (7) was born 12 Dec. 1901 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. She married first, in Evanston, Wyoming, Benjamin Eugene Slagowski. Shortly afterwards, 8 June 1921, the marriage was solemnized in the Salt Lake Temple. Twenty-four years and some months later, 12 Nov. 1945, a temple divorce separated them. On 17 Nov. 1950 in Elko, Nevada, LaFaun married her second husband, Ray Hatch Butler, a widower with one son. This marriage ended shortly in divorce.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaFaun has written a sketch of some of her activities over the years, from which we quote:— “In Gunnison, Utah I sang a solo in Primary conference at age five; was Sunday School organist at age eleven with Aunt Elsie Bartholomew as chorister; had a lead in the High School operetta “Windmills of Holland” directed by Lillie Mellor Metcalf. In Evanston, Wyoming:- While in High School I had my name engraved on a silver loving cup trophy in honor of our girls basketball team who won over all the State—I was the center; was Primary Stake organist and organist on the Relief Society Stake Board, the youngest Stake Board member in the church at that time, according to Woodruff Stake President John M. Baxter; I traveled through the Stake with missionaries, playing for conferences and occasionally speaking in different Wards; I was hired by James Brown to be a substitute for the Evanston Court reporter, Clarence Cook, when he was out of town; I played for silent movies and with Smuin’s and Toy’s orchestras for dances, with Starkey’s and Christensen’s orchestra and the Evanston High School orchestra. I worked part time in Father’s office while he was sheriff.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In Salt Lake City, Utah:- I typed reports for my husband who worked for the Secret Service there. In Ogden, Utah:- I was a member of the Ogden Tabernacle choir for twenty-one years; assisted Mr. Lester Henchcliff in directing the Singing Mothers and with the training of students <span id="page-717"></span> and soloists for the choir; was offered a scholarship to the Chicago School of Music but did not accept because I had four children at the time and taught piano and vocal, up to twenty-five students for years. I directed operettas for Primary and M.I.A. in the Ogden Fourth Ward, also Relief Society cantatas and Boy Scout choruses. I directed an opera for the Weber Stake M.I.A.; directed the Twenty-Second Ward choir; directed Weber Stake M.I.A. chorus concerts in the Tabernacle, with as many as two hundred and seventy-five teenagers participating at a time, and directed the singing in the Seven Stake Recreation meetings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“San Francisco, Calif.:- (1945-1946) I sang in operas with the Travis Opera Co. and with the Player’s Club, during which time I was Sunday School chorister in the San Francisco Ward. Salt Lake City, Utah:- I was choir director for the Central Park Ward, 1946/47, during which time we presented Handel’s ‘Messiah’; was McKay Ward organist for a time and then director of the Ward choir, during which time we presented the ‘Messiah’ for Easter. I directed a junior choir of eight and nine year olds in three-part singing in Crystal Heights Ward (the Bishop’s name was Stutz); was soloist with the Wilford Ward choir (director Brother Ray); Sunday School chorister in the Rose Park Ward (Bishop Newell Linford); and was choir director in the Emerson Ward, where I presented Handel’s ‘Messiah’, using my son Don Slagowski and his wife Betty as two of the soloists, I also presented the ‘Messiah’ in the Poplar Grove Ward for Mrs. Ririe; in Memory Grove two seasons at Eastertime in both the Twenty-first and the Thirteenth Wards and also in Central Park Ward for the second time after twenty years. I served as Twenty-first Ward Sunday School chorister and as Ward organist; chorister for ‘Sociables’, an adult group sponsored by the General Board of the M.I.A, and directed their chorus in a presentation of ‘The Seven Last Words of Christ’ at Eastertime at Memory Grove. I was called on a mission by President David O. McKay to work in the Genealogical Library for two years, 1963-65, to convert genealogy sheets records to magnetic tape - I completed my mission, <span id="page-718"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I worked for the U. S. Government between ten and eleven years in the Adj-General’s office and in nearly all departments of the Veteran’s Administration regional office. I then acted as medical secretary at the LDS Hospital for eight and a half years and as medical secretary supervisor during seven of those years, interviewing and training medical secretaries, taking doctors’ dictations and taking full charge of thirty dictating machine stations, etc. I then became medical secretary for the Primary Children’s Hospital for two years, retiring from there 30 Dec. 1966.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaFaun bought a nice home in Bountiful and moved there about the time of her retirement. Her children were all married, with some of them living in Bountiful. The habits of a lifetime could not be discarded; LaFaun became Ward organist and Junior Sunday School chorister in the Bountiful Val Verda Ward. She had an opportunity to go back to work at the LDS Hospital so she sold her home in Bountiful after a year to one of her sons and moved back to Salt Lake City into a small condominium, buying her own apartment there on Vine Street just north of the Salt Lake Temple. She went often to the Temple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Having been divorced for many years from her husband and father of her six children, Ben Slagowski, LaFaun was married in the Salt Lake Temple 16 May 1968 to a widower with two grown daughters, Willis Little Jacobson (b. 25 July 1897 in Colonia Diaz, Chihuahua, Mexico to James and Harriet Little Jacobson). Willis has served several missions in Mexico and is an ardent temple worker and genealogist. They moved to his home in West Jordan but kept her apartment on Vine Street. LaFaun directed a presentation of ‘The Creation’ not long afterwards and then left for a trip to Europe. We received a card from her dated in Zurich, Switzerland 16 June 1968, with a message as follows:- “Dear Folks: Have been to London and tried out the Hyde Park organ; also having a copy of my great-grandmother’s marriage certificate sent to me from Somerset House. Toured Holland - Amsterdam is the largest seaport in the world - enjoyed it more than Pearl Harbor in <span id="page-719"></span> Hawaii. Toured Germany - now in Zurich, Switzerland - then on to Austria, Venice, Rome, Florence, Pisa - then Paris. I hope I can get a plane out of Paris to join my British Mission Tour in London for my return home. Will be gone a month on my honeymoon - alone! Then together we’ll go to California and then Mexico. It will be quite a summer for me. Love, LaFaun.” While in London and Switzerland she entered the LDS temples there - it was a wonderful experience. She and Willis were all ready to go to Mexico City when her brother Rex passed away. They postponed their trip for a few days until after the funeral. They were in Mexico during the Olympics there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We received another card from LaFaun not long ago - this one dated 15 Feb. 1969 in Hamilton, New Zealand. She wrote, “Darlings: Had a wonderful night again at the Polynesian Center in Hawaii. Landed on the Fiji Islands and saw very green lawns and beautiful flowers. Toured Auckland, New Zealand and now will be here for a couple of days. Today we go to the New Zealand temple and this will mean that I have gone to all our temples in the world. I have planned this for many years. Again, my husband wouldn’t come. He wants to go to Mexico again alone, so I decided to complete my plans. Love, LaFaun C. Jacobson.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So for LaFaun a dream has come true - many dreams in fact.</p>
