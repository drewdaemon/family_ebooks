  <p class="calibre1">(45) Weldon “D” Christensen (7), the “D” just an initial like his father’s, was born 7 Mar. 1912 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Just a few days after Weldon turned four years old his family left Gunnison by train and moved to a ranch some miles east of Lyman, Wyoming, which was called “The Oasis” by members of the family. They lived on their homesteaded ranch in summers and in Lyman, Wyoming, in winters for several years during which time “firebugs” tried to burn them out and drive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-872" title="872"></span> them from the ranch. These were critical times for their family as well as others of their Christensen relatives who had also taken out homestead property on The Oasis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weldon attended school in Lyman and also in Evanston and a short time in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Like so many of the grandsons of Laurs and Else K. Christensen he grew to be a big fellow. He often helped his father on the ranch near Lyman, Wyoming, and was the only one of the children of Louis and Florence Christensen who chose to make a permanent home in the area. He has had a number of unusual, impressive experiences in his lifetime. One was when the big boiler blew up on the ranch and he and his father and others were miraculously saved. Another was when his father died. These two experiences have been related earlier in this book in the history of his father.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weldon has told us something of his later life in these words:— “I married a girl named Beth Blackner (b. 26 Feb. 1916 in Lyman, Wyoming to Frank and Mary Margaret Syme Blackner) 11 Apr. 1932, first in Evanston, Wyoming and then thirteen years later, 28 Nov. 1945, in the Salt Lake Temple. We have a beautiful daughter, Colleen, born four years after our civil marriage and sealed to us at the time of our sealing in the temple. She married a man named Wallace Hart and they have three children. They are all very wonderful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I myself am 6 ft. tall, with brown hair and brown eyes and weigh 225 lbs. My wife Beth is 5 ft. 4 inches tall, weighs 114 lbs. and has black hair and brown eyes. We have enjoyed our marriage together and have had a very deep love for each other, our daughter Colleen and her children and also for her husband who has been a model husband and a good father.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We own our own home which we built ourselves, which is the third house we have built here in Lyman. Beth is a secretary to the superintendent of the Lyman High School and has been for more than fifteen years. Before that she was a clerk in the Lyman Mercantile here for fifteen years. I myself have been mostly in carpentry work but ran <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-873" title="873"></span> a school bus for years and raised chickens and sold eggs on the side. I worked at Hill Field in Utah for almost five years, first as a warehouse man and then as an aqua system man (aviation gasoline with water pressure). Three others and myself handied all the aviation gasoline on Hill Air Force Base during the last world war, handling hundreds of thousands of gallons of airplane gas that serviced the planes and bombers that flew in and out of the base.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was in the LDS Hospital for treatment some time ago. The entrance to my heart and my left lung aren’t so good yet and I shake and am still weak.” A recent letter from Weldon’s and Beth’s daughter, Colleen, contains the following:- “We live just forty miles from Mother and Dad and have close contact with them. Our children really enjoy them. Dad has retired, due to a heart condition; however, Mother is still working at the school as secretary for the District, which keeps her really busy even though she has an ulcer.”</p>
