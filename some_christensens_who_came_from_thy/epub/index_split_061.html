  <h2 id="ruth-ellen-christensen" class="calibre9">Ruth Ellen Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(15) Ruth Ellen Christensen (3) was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 7 Oct. 1902. She was delivered by her grandmother Else K. Christensen. The account of her birth has been given in some detail in an earlier part of this book. She was baptized 11 Oct. 1910 in the Manti Temple. She grew up in a family of boys for her two only sisters died soon after their births. To these five fine brothers, towering above her, she has always been a most loving and helpful sister. They always speak of her with great affection and love to visit at her home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ruth herself has written a brief history of her married years, from which we quote:— “I married Niels Franklin Hansen (born 28 Nov. 1899 in Centerfield, Sanpete, Utah to Hans Christian and Anna Margaret Nielson Hansen) in Richfield, Utah 30 June 1921. We have had a wonderful marriage. (Cousin Byron Peterson says that Ruth and Frank lived in his parents’ home for a short time when they were first married.) Our first child, Franklin Duane, was born in the home <span id="page-725"></span> of Annie Gledhill, sister of the other Bishop Joseph Christensen. When Ellen Maxine, our second child, was six weeks old we rented and moved into the home I had grown up in. She caught cold and it developed into bronchial asthma. We have raised her on prayer since then but she still isn’t well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After four children the doctor said I wasn’t able to have any more. On Dec. 7, 1937 I had triple surgery in Salt Lake City and a little over one year and three months after that our lovely daughter, LaDon was born. On 25 Oct. 1948 had triple surgery again and on 9 Mar. 1966 I had another major operation - so now I should be in fine shape.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We lived in Sterling, Utah for awhile and while there I taught sewing in the three older  primary grades in the local school for two years, to prepare them for High School in Manti, the first year without pay. I taught sewing two years here in San Diego one day a week, under the direction of the Adult Education program, and turned my check over to the Ward Bishop for our building fund project. I did alterations in a dress-making shop here for several years, long enough to-earn Social Security.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have taught in M.I.A. and Relief Society (Theology) and been a Relief Society Work Counselor.  My latest service was eighteen months as a Sunday School teacher while Frank was in the Sunday School Superintendency. Our son Duane has worked with the Scouts for years. His wife, Jean, is now Primary president, after having served eight years as Sunday School Coordinator. Our daughter Maxine’s health does not permit much activity but her children are all active in the church. Garth Joseph in 1950 was all-star softball pitcher for the church and brought the trophy back to our then-new Ward. Since then he has been Y.M.M.1.A. president, Branch president,  a Stake High Councilman, on a Stake mission and in the Stake Mission presidency and had many other responsibilities in the church. He is now bishop of his Ward in Escondido, Calif. His wife Joan used to teach Seminary, then served on the <span id="page-726"></span> Relief Society Stake Board. Norma was the queen of the first Gold and Green ball in our new Ward. LaDon is teaching in Sunday School and has a troop of Cub Scouts; she used to teach in Primary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I feel that perhaps one of my greatest achievements is my long list of friends and the many children besides our own grandchildren who call Frank and me ‘Grandpa’ and ‘Grandma’. I was written up one year in Neal Morgan’s newspaper  column as having received one hundred birthday cards that year. In 1967 we received two hundred and two Christmas cards, plus other greetings - so much love!” On the back of many of the friendly letters that Ruth sends out is a little sticker bearing the following message:— “Dear  Letter; go upon your way, over mountain, plain or sea. God bless all who speed your flight to where I wish you to be. And bless all those beneath the roof where I would bid you rest. But bless much more the one to whom this letter is addressed.” This message is so typical of the love and goodwill Ruth bears her relatives and friends and people everywhere.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ruth and Frank make occasional trips back to Utah, especially at deer season when Frank goes to hunt. Their last trip to date was to attend Ruth’s brother Harold’s funeral. Frank recently retired and Ruth writes of this:— “Frank has just retired after twenty-three years as a civilian employee of the U. S. Navy, teaching the apprentices in electronics. He said he didn’t realize how important he had been until he was through and they said so many nice things about him. ‘It was just like attending my own funeral’ he said. He had his picture taken with the ‘Captain of the Island’ and other naval dignitaries.” During this time they have lived in San Diego. Perhaps now they will find time for more trips to visit relatives and friends.</p>
