  <p class="calibre1">(24) Arthur Melrose Christensen (8) was born 22 June 1905 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the old Gledhill home at 367 West lst North, which is still standing (1969). He is reported to have been a beautiful child, to which his early pictures testify. The family called him “Rosy”. He was baptized a member of the LDS church 1 Nov. 1913. He attended school in Gunnison in winters and graduated from High School there. In summers he helped his father on the farm. Finally tiring of farming he traveled about doing various jobs and then settled down in Dividend, Utah, where he took up mining for the Tintic Standard Mining Co., which pursuit he followed for about ten years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was while living in Dividend that he met his first wife, Reva Giles (b. 30 Jan. 1911, Heber City, Utah to Franklin Shelton and Acie LuVella Provost Giles). She was a beautiful girl and they made a handsome couple. They were married 1 Feb. 1929 in Provo, Utah. Reva (now Mrs. Kinder) says they announced their marriage to his family two evenings later in the Eagle House Hotel in Manti, Utah, when they attended his parents’ twenty-fifth wedding anniversary party <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-780" title="780"></span> there, They wrapped their marriage license up with the gift they presented them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some years later Melrose, Reva and their two children moved to Salt Lake City and he became employed as an automotive mechanic for the Frank Edwards Company, in which capacity he served for some twenty-three years, according to a record published at the time of his death. Cousin A. Owen Bartholomew says that he remembers that “Melrose had a racing car at one time. He was the mechanic and another fellow the driver and they went around to various places racing and nearly lost their shirts.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His brother Wesley’s wife Leola said of Melrose, “We lived closely for many years in Dividend. He and Wesley were very close although I think their outlook on life and the future was somewhat different. Melrose was always a favorite of mine and I loved him dearly - he was always so kind and thoughtful of us.” His sister Grace once wrote, “The older I get the more I appreciate my wonderful brothers. They are all so different and so lovable!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Years after their marriage Melrose and Reva separated. On 31 May 1950 in Ely, Nevada, Melrose married Mrs. Drucilla Edna Thompson Colman (b. 8 Jan. 1909 Cedar City, Utah to William M. and Elizabeth Ann Paramore Thompson). She was a nurse and operated the apartment in which they lived. It was her third marriage and of course the second for Melrose. The last part of his life Melrose was an invalid, confined to their apartment at 223 Third Ave., and Drucilla took care of him. He suffered from what they called “miners’ consumption”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout his life Melrose was always rather close to his mother so it does not seem too strange that they should have departed this life within a very short time of each other. She died Wed. 1 Nov. 1961 at 2 p.m. in her home in Salt Lake City and he died Wed. 8 Nov. 1961 at 8:15 p.m. in a Salt Lake hospital. Each funeral was held the Saturday following each death at the same local Mortuary and while Millie was buried in Manti beside her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-781" title="781"></span> husband, Arthur Melrose was buried in the Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Salt Lake City. Less than two years following his death, 27 July 1963 his wife Drucilla passed away and was buried beside him in Mt. Olivet Cemetery.</p>
