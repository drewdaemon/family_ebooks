  <p class="calibre1">The basic processes of life go on much the same in all ages - man lives and loves and mates, his children are born and he buries his dead. But oh, how varied is the breadth and depths of living, how contrasted the quality and color, as each man seeks his place under the everlasting stars. Living can be as different as black and white, rough and smooth, songs of birds, and butterflies wings. No peoples have actually been the same - no places, no ages - nor have the influences that have affected them. Though historians have grouped and catalogued them, individuals must have always been quite different, even in Old Denmark, Surely there were those who led; the in-betweens and on-the-fences; the aggressive - the rebels - the weak. But whether richmen, poormen, stone age-men, peasants, nobles or kings, people as well as nations have had to learn to get along with each other if they wished <span id="page-19"></span> to succeed, or even to survive; thus, during the seemingly endless process, various forms of government have evolved.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In ancient Denmark a freedom-inspired, communal sort of living was the vogue. Independent farming settlements or tribes were the governing bodies and individual peasant families the units. (“Peasant” referred to one who worked with the land, so all “Danes” were peasants to begin with.) Each settlement had its own tribal councils, called “Thing” meetings, where decrees were recited from heart by the “lawman” and peasants discussed matters and made decisions. All major projects were on a cooperative basis and each man had his say and, though some undoubtedly spoke louder than others, liberty was very much alive! As the country became more populated men came to think that “war” was the way to succeed. Settlement chieftains began fighting each other for desirable tracts of land that gradually grew into small kingdoms. The successful war lords were the forerunners of the Danish nobility. Before the time of the Vikings Denmark was pretty well divided into separate kingdoms, and the greater land holders had gained the status of “nobles” - there were likely even those who had set themselves up as “kings”, Nevertheless, the peasants were still largely in control - they were a stubborn lot and hard to suppress. Freedom was their heart-throb from the start!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have called this land “Denmark” from the beginning but it really had no special name until about 900 A.D., at the time it was first united into one kingdom. A Viking sea king, who, became more interested in his own land than in others’, fought and brought all of the Danish area under his rule and for a time was also king of Norway. King Harold Bluetooth (app. 935-985), son of King Gorm and Queen Thyra, began to be in favor of peace and of staying home and building up his kingdom; but the war-minded nobles, who couldn’t forget the fun of being Vikings, felt differently. The King’s son, Sweyn Forkbeard, was their leader and the opposing forces fought. The king was slain and Sweyn became king <span id="page-20"></span> (app. 985-1014). He called the nobles and peasants together and with his main chieftains, “Torkil the Tall” and “Oluv the Fat”, sailed to England and harassed her king, “Ethelred the Unready”, until he subdued him and became king of England too. His triumph was short however, for the very next year this “Caesar of the North” fell off his horse and died. (The English contend St. Edmond slew him) Canute the Great (1018-1035) fought and added part of Sweden to this fantastic North Sea Empire, and though he was a good and mighty monarch he died young. Sad to say, under the reigns of his incompetent sons, Harold Harefoot (1035-1040) and Hardicanute (1035-1042), the great empire toppled and England slipped through the fingers of future Danish kings. King Sweyn Estridson (1047-1074) tried to regain his famous Uncle Canute’s vast English holdings and sent Viking fleets there to defeat William the Conqueror, but was unsuccessful. From then on the two countries more or less turned their backs on each other. Though they sometimes fought, cultural and commercial bonds were severed and each went their own way and wrote their own histories for about the next eight hundred years. As long as the Viking fleets were free and manned by volunteer peasant raiders, and as long as there were settle- ment chieftains to organize them on their own initiative, the Danish Vikings continued to be a terrifying threat to their western targets; but when the Kings took over and forced the issue, that business of raiding simply petered out. Den- mark never again reverted back to what she had been before and Christianity began to take root there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since kings are only people and since people are different, so were the Danish kings and their performances, as a brief commentary on some who ruled during the early Middle Ages tends to indicate, Canute the Holy (1080-1086) introduced a tax for the benefit of the Church (10% of all harvested corn) and imposed heavy fines on the peasants who rebelled in North Jutland, from whence he was forced to flee to a cathedral where they slew him. Because famine followed his death—and miracles are said to have happened at <span id="page-21"></span> his tomb—he became Denmark’s Patron Saint. Oluf Hunger (1086-1095) ruled through nine years of famine. Eric Egode meaning “the only good one” (1095-1103) so named because the crops began to grow again in his reign, wasn’t really good. So he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land as a penance and became the first European King to do so, though he died enroute. Since it took so long to get word back to his subjects, he ruled Denmark for nearly a year after his death—believe it or not. King Niels (1104-1134) sat peaceably upon his throne, steadily attending to the affairs of State like some ancient Scandinavian nobleman farmer. But he bored the modern knights and nobles, who forced him into battle over Slesvig (South Jutland) in his declining years. Eric Emune (1134-1137), hard, brutal and generally loathed, was condemned at a “Thing” meeting and slain by a Jutlandic noble, “Black Plough”. Eric Lamb (1137-1146) the inadequate, almost let the kingdom fall apart, since each peasant settlement began governing itself as it had before the country was united, In practice, the person of the Danish king still meant so little that the peasants had small difficulty having things their way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Great Period of the Valdemars” (1146-1241) began with the “War of the Princes”, wherein three royal contenders fought bitterly for the throne. They divided Denmark into three parts, one for each; but at a banquet to celebrate the peace, Canute was slain, Valdemar wounded, and Swen Grathe blamed. He fled but in his flight was killed by a Jutlandic peasant, who “split his skull with an axe”. King Valdemar the Great (1157-1182), whose mother was Russian, reunited the Kingdom and be- came the first of three successful kings to rule during one of the most progressive and prosperous times in Danish history. The last of these, Valde- mar the Victorious (1202-1241) won much territory for the Crown, especially from Germany. (It was in his reign that the great battle took place at which the Dane’s flag “Dannebrog” supposedly floated down from heaven as a “sign from God.”) But just when things were looking wonderful for the country, the king was taken prisoner and held for years while the Germans regained Holstein. <span id="page-22"></span> When released, Valdemar fought again to win back the land but was victorious no more—he lost the battle, one eye and a son in the fray. Shortly before his death he drew up a set of national laws, for up to this time Denmark had no uniform or written ones. Since rules and regulations were not always remembered alike by the “lawmen” of the various settlements, there were often problems. This “Jutlandic Law” proved most successful in solving these.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">King Eric “Ploughpenny” (1241-1250), so called because he instigated a plough tax, had trouble with the Church. Eric Clipping (1259-1286) made peace with the Church but had trouble with the nobles, They felt the time had come to curb the king’s powers and made him sign an agreement to that extent. (Royal Charter of 1282) This gave the nobility much more say in the Danish government but it didn’t bring peace. One terribly stormy night the King, who was hunting in Jutland, was forced to take refuge in a village barn. A band of nobles fought their way in and attacked him, leaving him dead with 56 wounds. Legal action was taken, under terms of the new Charter, and nine of the country’s leading nobles were found guilty, among them the Lord High Constable Stig Andersen Hvide (most likely one of our grandmother’s distant relatives, and ours). He was banished and retired to an island in the Kattegat where he lived like an ancient Viking - raiding the Danish coasts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two kings in succession nearly wrecked Denmark. Eric Menved (1286-1319) and Christopher II (1320-1326 &amp; 1330-1332) mortgaged most of the country to pay for their extravagances, until not one single square foot of land remained in Dane’s possession. Denmark was without a king for nearly eight years and the king was without a kingdom, while her wealthy German masters built their castles all over, levied crippling taxes on her peasants to pay for them, and sent ruthless German soldiers to collect the money. By 1340 the country seemed doomed; rebellion was seething throughout the land, but especially in Jutland. A powerful Count, “Gert the Baldheaded” of Holstein, marched up into the peninsula with an army of 11,000 men, <span id="page-23"></span> intent on quelling the trouble at its source. Buton the night of April 1st a Jutlandic Squire, Niels Ebbesen, crept in and slew the great Count in his bed chamber. The news sped swiftly all around Jutland and her peasants geared for battle. In the face of it all the invading Germans lost their courage and retreated south without fighting. Denmark was saved! Niels Ebbesen became a national hero. (There is a statue of him in Randers.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">King Valdemar “Atterdag”, sometimes called “the evil” (1340-1375), won little affection in Denmark but he won back the land, bit by bit, all except south Slesvig. He was on his way to confiscate that when he suddenly died “of an unfortunate remedy for curing gout.” (During his kingship the terrible bubonic plague [Black Death] struck, claiming almost half the Danish population.) Though he had no scruples he was one of Denmark’s most noteworthy kings, for what he accomplished was short of miraculous. At his death his daughter Margaret (1387-1397) wormed her way in and had the nobles proclaim her, not as queen but as “Dame of our Kingdoms, Master of our Houses, Mighty Guardian”. She united the three Scandinavian, countries under one ruler, to be elected jointly, and this union lasted, on and off, with Sweden for 126 years, but Denmark and Norway remained united for 434 years (until 1814). With Margaret, the familiar intimacy of nicknaming Danish kings ceased, then heraldic names were used and later numbers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sitting astride the “Sound”, Denmark had controlled this entrance to the Baltic Sea, one of Europe’s busiest channels, since ancient times. Her king, Eric of Pomerania (1397-1438), antagonized all the seafaring nations by introducing “Sound dues”, He decreed that all who passed through there should pay toll, and to make sure he built huge fortified castles on either side, For 428 years the ships of all nations were obliged to dip their flags, strike their topsails, and pay “dues” when passing Elsinore (where Hamlet’s ghost once walked), This brought immense sums of money to Denmark but endless political misery as well. This king is described as having been <span id="page-24"></span> very handsome, with “a beautiful physique, golden-yellow hair, a ruddy complexion and a long, slender neck which he covered with a linen cloth fastened with a golden brooch. He would leap into the saddle without the help of stirrups, and all women were drawn to him”. The peasants finally rebelled at his autocratic rule and the nobles followed. Tiring of it all he abdicated, hied himself to an island and pensioned himself off as a pirate. His nephew and successor, Christopher of Bavaria (1439-1448) joined with the nobles against the peasants, whom they tried to subjugate entirely. When the peasants rebelled in northern Jutland the King went in person at the head of an army and dealt them a bloody defeat.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So the self-willed Barons, Counts and Knights of Denmark were having their day. It had become a tradition to award all the highest ecclesiastical posts in the Danish Catholic Church to the Danish nobles as political plums. Under these aristocratic leaders the Church took over a great deal of the good land and became rich and powerful, Too, assemblies of nobles and high churchmen (Rigsraads) had largely taken over control of the government, under the kings whom they elected.</p>
