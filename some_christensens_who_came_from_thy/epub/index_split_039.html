  <h2 id="albert-h-christensen" class="calibre9">ALBERT “H” CHRISTENSEN</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">None can successfully dispute the claim that Albert, like the rest of these Christensens, was of pure Danish descent back to the fearless Vikings of old, and even beyond. Although his parents, Laurs and Else K. Christensen, were transplanted from Little Denmark to the great western land they called “Zion”, a little more than six years before his birth, and he was born an American citizen, still the blood of the ancient Norsemen ran strong in his veins.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His mother recorded his birth in her journal thus:— “Alberth Chresten fød den 13 Dec. 1872 i Gunnison.” So it was Albert Christen Christensen he was named and blessed in the L. D. S. church in Gunnison, Utah, by Bishop Joseph S. Horne, 2 Jan. 1873, when he was twenty days old. He was his parents’ only “winter” baby and the first born to them “in the covenant”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert seldom used the middle name Christen, likely given him for his grandfather, and in early manhood dropped it altogether and assumed the middle initial “H”. Like some of his older brothers he also changed the spelling of the last part of his surname from the Danish “sen” to the anglicized “son”. A number of reasons may have been at the root of this name change and we should not discount the possibility that the disdain and even cruel treatment accorded many “lowly Scandinavians” by some of the early English born Saints may have been a <span id="page-534"></span> factor. It was not popular in some areas of Zion, even in Sanpete, to be a Danishman or a Swede. In fact, a few of the early Danish converts in Sanpete County, and elsewhere, apostatized from the church because of the shameful treatment accorded them by their English “brethren”. Likely none of these early English converts who may have prided themselves on their “royal” descent from England’s great “William the Conqueror” knew that this same William, Duke of Normandy, was a grandson of the early Danish Viking Chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French) who more or less seized Normandy from the French king in 911 A.D. Is it not an advantage to know who one really is?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert was scarcely two when his family moved from Gunnison to North Mayfield, his parents having joined the “United Order” experiment then in progress there. Here he was given his first lessons at his mother’s knee; for she was deeply interested in education and studied to perfect her speaking and reading of English along with her children. When the “Order” was dissolved there the early spring of 1877, the Christensens moved across Twelve Mile Creek to South Mayfield. It was here that Albert entered public school for the first time, the fall of 1878, a few months before he turned six.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When he was six and a half his mother went to Salt Lake City to study medicine. After her return she was away from home a great deal treating the sick or delivering babies. The children became accustomed to the sight of her brown medical kit, always packed and standing ready at a moments notice, and the sound of heavy wagons rattling up their street day or night and stopping to pick up their mother, then rattling off again in the direction they had come.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the severe, disastrous winter of 1879/80 the family sold its interests in Mayfield and moved back to Gunnison where they lived for a short time in a small adobe in the east part of town owned by a relative, Lars Myrup. Albert was then a towheaded youngster of seven and a half and rather large for his age. His father soon <span id="page-535"></span> leased a farm in North Christenburg, owned by Julius H. Christensen, and here they lived in summers for the next several years. His father purchased some property in northwest Gunnison on which stood a two-roomed adobe dwelling where the large family lived for a few months each winter while the older children attended school in the Relief Society Hall, about a block east of them, which was also used for church gatherings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A larger house, of rock, was erected near the old one and the family used both houses to live in for a time. Additional rooms were eventually added to the new house and additional children to the family, until there were nine living children in all besides the two little ones who had passed away soon after their births. Soon the family moved back to Gunnison altogether and the new rock house became the “ancestral home” of their descendants. It was from this home that Albert walked some several miles to the Sanpitch River, with his bundle of clothes under his arm, and was baptized a member of the L. D. S. church, by John Larsen, and dressed later behind a squawberry bush. This was 5 Apr. 1882, when he was almost four months past nine. He was confirmed next day in church, 6 Apr. 1882, by Samuel Lublin.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From the time he was old enough to take responsibility Albert was given work to do in the home and on the farm. As he grew in size and confidence he became eager to get a job for pay. He soon learned that working away from home for someone else was not always what it was “cracked up to be”. Between ages ten and eleven he hired out to one Peterson for $3 a month and board, When he was not much past twelve he worked for a short time for Bishop A. C. Madsen hauling manure in a wagon with a span of contrary mules.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But a few days later another job opportunity came to Albert. Julius H. Christensen, for whom his older brother Chris was then herding sheep, hired him to run a farm for him at $12 a month and “keep”. With but a few extra clothes, besides the overalls and shirt he was wearing, he was taken out to run an approximately 300 acre farm in South Christenburg on which stood a one-room <span id="page-536"></span> log cabin with a lean-to. With only general directions he was left to live there alone. Most of the time that summer of 1885 he had no companions except the horses with which he worked the farm, a mongrel dog who seemed to need a master, and a horde of night-reveling pack rats as big as half grown cats.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Notwithstanding that my employer had the reputation of being a hard man to work for”, wrote Albert of this experience, “I found him the opposite. His family, consisting of himself, his wife, five daughters and one son, was really a model family. I was always treated with the greatest respect by all of them. While Mr. Christensen himself claimed to be an atheist, his family was affiliated with the Presbyterian church in Gunnison. Without any request on my part my employer, on two different occasions that summer, told me I was worth more than I was being paid. The first time he raised my wages to $15 per month and the second to $20. This, together with ‘keep’ was a high wage for a boy of my age at the time.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Late that fall Albert went home and attended school for some three months, which was about the usual school year in those early farm communities. He was in the “fifth reader” at the time. Early the next spring he was again hired by Julius Christensen and this time he had charge of a herd of sheep in the mountains. He was then nearing fifteen. That late fall he again went home and attended school for about three months, then returned to the mountains again in early spring to herd sheep for Mr. Christensen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert must have been a hard and dependable worker, even as a youth, for his responsibilities were being constantly increased, as well as his wages. He never seemed to have trouble getting employment. The fall of 1888 Mr. Christensen told him that if he would continue to work for him with the sheep he would pay him as high a wage as any man in his employ except his brother Chris, who was his foreman. That was $30 a month and board; Chris was getting $35. So Albert stayed on for another full year, or until he was approaching his seventeenth birthday. He was often lonely in <span id="page-537"></span> the mountains. Trouble with Indians, cattlemen, mired and frozen sheep was not uncommon to him. His memories of a happy home and the occasional visits of his brother Chris strengthened and sustained him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His year’s service ended, his employer again came to him and offered to rent him a herd and assist him in getting started in the sheep business for himself if he would stay on with the sheep as his brother Chris was doing. Now Albert had always cherished the greatest admiration for his oldest brother and this offer must have been a real temptation to him; but he had made up his mind to get an education so he turned down the offer and went back to Gunnison to school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rather early in life Albert had dreamed of becoming a lawyer. He said, “As a child I was intrigued with court hearings and attracted to trials in the Justice of the Peace courts. I believe they were held in the school house in those days. I happened there once when the Justice and two men, whom I knew to be lawyers, were conducting the preliminary hearing of a case involving grand larceny. The lawyers were Jacob Johnson and William K. Reid. Johnson was a man who attracted general attention. He was rather large and heavy set and wore a long Prince Albert coat and silk stovepipe hat, and all in all had a most distinguished appearance. William K. Reid, a small man with keen gray eyes, was slightly stooped and his right hand seemed to be withered and useless. (Both of these gentlemen Albert was to be rather closely associated with in the law profession years later.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Jacob Johnson, with his deep voice and measured sentences, almost scared me. His sharp, sarcastic retorts, witty Scotch-Irish insinuations and illustrations I found amazing and delightful. From that time on I never missed a Justice trial when there was one in town, school or no school. As a result of this, or perhaps something else beyond my understanding, I seemed to have the firm conviction that I would someday be a lawyer. Strengthening this intention was my parents’ confidence in me, for it finally <span id="page-538"></span> became known to them that despite all odds I was going to study law. A close friend told me of my mother’s reaction when she spoke to her about the many hardships and temptations to be encountered in attaining and following this profession. My mother said she had full confidence in me and knew I would surmount the obstacles and be a good lawyer.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The autumn of 1890, when his mother went back to visit her people in Old Denmark and search out her genealogy, Albert entered the Gunnison Seminary. The next fall he went to Provo, Utah and enrolled in the Brigham Young Academy there. A Judge Wilson was giving an elementary course in law and Albert was attracted to this. Here he was introduced to some of the writings of the famous English jurist and legal historian, Sir William Blackstone, and later bought one of his books. He also registered for German, mathematics and psychology. The fine educator, Dr. Karl G. Maeser, was still president of the B. Y. A. until about midterm that year, or Jan, 1892. Albert recalled Dr. Maeser passing him one morning bound for his home where he had inadvertantly left his keys. “Ven you haf your brains in your heels”, he explained in his inimitable manner, “you must use your heels!” While there he also played on the college football team, which was before the days of heavy padding and helmets when the game was really rough.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He helped to put himself through college by working summers and teaching alternate winters. The school year of 1892/93 he served as Principal of the District School in the small farming community of Koosharem, Sevier County. The fall of 1893 he again entered B. Y. A. and continued his studies in English, German, Latin, mathematics, speech and pedagogy. Dr. Benjamin Cluff was president of the Academy then.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The winter of 1894/95 Albert taught fifth and sixth grades in his hometown of Gunnison. That summer he worked hauling posts and poles to fence the 160 acres of land he had purchased from his father. He had also acquired a city lot and several head of livestock out of his earnings. I heard him speak of that pleasant year at home <span id="page-539"></span> among his loved ones. He mentioned his father as being so wise, patient, kind and helpful. He spoke of his mother with great affection as “the life and soul of the home!” She then had given up her extensive medical practice of some fourteen years and was taking boarders. She and Albert had many intimate and inspiring conversations that year, and one particular one about marriage. He also mentioned his delicate little foster sister, Ada, and what joy her sweetness shed in their home. He spoke of looking forward to visits with her on his return from school in late afternoons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">During that year he often visited his grandfather, Christen Christensen, the only one of his grandparents he had ever known. He had such great respect and fondness for the fine old Danish gentleman. The two had much in common, including their love for fine horses. The older man had raised a thoroughbred filly from birth, with Albert in mind, telling him that it would someday be his. Together they had watched this outstanding animal grow and develop until she was ready for the reins. Albert broke her and it was during that year that he was given this mare for his own; although he insisted on giving his grandfather a fair price for it. He bought a smart rubber-tired buggy to go along with his horse and when he went to Provo to again attend B. Y. A. he drove up in style. That rig was his pride and joy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">President Cluff also took a liking to Albert’s rig and often borrowed it during that winter of 1895/96, professing a desire to purchase it from him and keeping it to “try out” for unnecessarily long periods at a time. This finally provoked Albert and he said a few harsh words to the president. He always felt this was the real reason that Cluff turned “thumbs down” on his being selected class orator for the graduating ceremony that Spring, although he was selected by his class. The president stated as his reason the fact that Albert hadn’t taken teachers training so wasn’t entitled to graduate. This of course was ambiguous, since Albert had been a practical teacher of two years experience. Albert refused to take out his degree from B. Y. A. under those conditions, in spite of <span id="page-540"></span> the fact that he had the support of his classmates and more than enough credits. We have heard the tale about what was lost “… all for the want of a horseshoe nail”, including the rider. In Albert’s case, however, nothing was lost except perhaps a bit of his pride, for he still had his horse and buggy and all the excellent knowledge and training accumulated towards his graduation, as well as an additional amount of wisdom regarding the frailties of man.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">During the school year of 1896/97, he acted as Principal of the Levan school in Juab County. In his spare time he indefatigably read Blackstone and other law books and also studied history. He had set his mind on attending the law school in Ann Arbor, Michigan if at all possible. When school closed he returned to Gunnison and continued to read and study law all the time hoping that his chance would come. Money for transportation and tuition was his main concern. That summer he greatly missed the ever-ready smile of the courageous little Ada in the home, for she had passed away the previous winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some other impressionable experiences came to Albert about that time. He was given the opportunity to argue his first case before the law. It was a jury trial and he put up a strenuous legal battle for the defense, a citizen of Gunnison. Although they lost the case, his client seemed well pleased with his services and the leniency of the verdict, as well as his fee. Albert figured the experience was well worth the time and effort and so charged nothing; besides it helped to strengthen his determination to go ahead with law - sometime - somehow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One evening he attended the local theater to witness a performance by a home dramatic club from Manti. On the handbill advertising the play was a picture of the leading lady - a Miss Virginia Snow. Her acting impressed Albert; in fact he became so interested in Miss Snow during the course of the evening that he saved her picture and placed it in one of the law books he was studying.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The long hoped for opportunity to go to law <span id="page-541"></span> school came rather unexpectedly soon after. About dusk, 11 Aug. 1897, as Albert approached home, he was met by Henry A. Kerns, a local sheepman, and offered the job of taking a train load of sheep back to Kansas City. He accepted immediately, even though he was to leave by early morning less than two days later. He realized that this was the opportunity he had been waiting for. He said, “My heart was beating rapidly as I arrived home. I told father and mother of my decision and received their blessing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next morning at daybreak I was on my way to the Manti City Savings Bank with my horse and rubber-tired buggy. I hoped that by borrowing enough money to pay my tuition for the first year I could somehow make my way through law school. I was kindly granted a loan of $200, although I already owed the bank $500 on my previous schooling. I arrived home after dark. Mother had my underwear, sox, extra clothes and other personal effects already packed in a telescope case. She pressed my only good suit which I had worn that day and packed that. At about 3:30 next morning we left for Gunnison depot. No one except father and mother was on hand to bid me ‘Godspeed’, yet with their faith in me I was sure I would not fail.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, Laurs and Else Christensen, his loyal and caring parents, stood encouraging and cheering from the sidelines every worthy ambition and accomplishment their children undertook. It was a matter of great love, but then again perhaps a little matter of pride also. Something outstanding could come out of Little Denmark!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So Albert went on his way east, in company with several carloads of lambs bound for the Kansas City market. He had only been out of the State of Utah once before and then no farther than Denver. Along with him also were his telescope case and a few law books, into one of which had been tucked a picture of Miss Virginia Snow. He was well prepared, however, for his schooling at the University in Ann Arbor, and in two years completed the regular three year law course and secured his coveted “sheepskin”. This was not done without sacrifice, long hours of grueling study, <span id="page-542"></span> working after school, and without selling most of what he had in Gunnison, including the treasured horse and buggy, nor without deeply appreciated financial help from his wonderful brother Chris “I.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Back in Utah the summer of 1899, Albert “hung up his shingle” in Manti. A dream of long standing was about to come true. And yet another dream was in the making, for soon he was introduced to Miss Virginia Snow, or “Jennie” as her friends all knew her. The two began dating and a wonderful courtship followed. Some proud moments came for Albert when he escourted “Miss Snow” to his hometown of Gunnison and she presented a dramatic, patriotic reading at the annual community Fourth of July celebration of 1900. She was so dainty, vivacious and talented.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert took Jennie to the Manti Temple, 26 Sept. 1900, and made her his own “leading lady”. Sometime in October they moved into their own two-story brick home at 155 North 2nd West, which Albert had been able to completely pay for and furnish, due to his having been selected to take care of the legal work pertaining to the settlement of some one hundred claims brought on by the tragic Scofield coal mine disaster.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those were mostly bright years as Albert and Jennie walked together through the corridors of an exceedingly happy marriage; as they brought forth their five beloved children; and as he became a highly respected lawyer, County Attorney, and finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court, comprising Sanpete, Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan counties. I recall the salary was $4,000 a year - quite a sum for those days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those were the days when lawyers went about their precincts in buggies, buckboards, or on horseback with law books tied to their saddles. During his judgeship Albert traveled by horse-drawn stage, train, and the automobile. Price, the County Seat of Carbon, was then at the zenith of its riproaring history and his calendar was filled with many sensational criminal trials, along with the important civil ones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As Albert prospered he bought sheep and land.</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-45">
    <span id="page-542a"></span> <img alt="Albert and Jennie" src="45.png" class="calibre7"/>

    <p>Wedding picture of Albert and Jennie</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-543"></span> He went into the sheep business with his brother Arthur, who cared for the sheep while he furnished the capital. They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mountain east of Salina. After lambing, about July 1st, they would move into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months and the winter on the west desert. Albert’s brother Louis helped Arthur take care of the sheep on the desert during some of those winters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert joined his brother-in-law, George Black, in a small land investment in Garfield County. He bought property from the Warren Stone Snow estate and built the first garage business in Manti. One of his major purchases was about 350 acres of land on either side of the Sevier River west of Gunnison which he called his “Gunnison Ranch” and into which he put a great deal of effort and money. Bert Gledhill says he was working for Albert on the Gunnison Ranch when he had the two huge barns built there and helped haul the lumber to build them. He was also working there when one of these big barns blew down during a turbulent windstorm and had to be rebuilt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 29 Apr. 1908, Albert made arrangements to buy 160 acres of land some eighteen miles north of Gunnison in an area known as Flat Canyon, and this he called his “Flat Canyon Ranch”. People came from long distances to buy the “blue ribbon peaches” raised by some in Flat Canyon. Large, white-rind watermelon from there received first prize at both County and State fairs one year. Albert hoped to make this ranch into a first rate fruit farm and planted a large number of peach trees. The summers were very hot there and the winters extremely cold, which created some problems.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Oct, 1910, exactly ten years after Albert and Jennie had settled in their first home, Albert moved his family into a lovely new home a half block south from the old. It was not quite finished at the time but by the next spring it was ready to show to their friends. Fri., Mar. 31, 1911, the Manti Messenger carried this article: <span id="page-544"></span> &gt;“Dedication of Home and Housewarming <br class="calibre4"/> Over Hundred People Entertained at <br class="calibre4"/> Christenson Home this week.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Judge and Mrs. A. H. Christenson entertained royally Wednesday and Thursday evenings, the first a dedication and the second a housewarming of their new palatial residence on Depot Street. Wednesday was the dedication and invitations were confined to relatives and neighbors, about 35 being present. The dedicatory prayer was offered by J. H. Carpenter and short talks were given by Bishop Peterson and Ezra Shoemaker. Music was furnished by Alida Snow and Prof. Fred J. Fjelsted. The balance of the evening consisted of games and refreshments.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thursday night invitations were issued to 70, a crowd of younger people made up mostly from the clubs. The High School orchestra furnished the music during the early evening and, in addition to a short program, the principal entertainment was cards. Refreshments were served also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Christenson home is an enviable possession and a credit to any city, built of white bricks and with every line in quality and style of finish noting stability. On the first floor are the reception hall and living room thrown into one, a large and a small dining room, kitchen and pantry. On the second floor are a library, three bedrooms, sun room and bath room. The reception hall, living room and large dining room are furnished with solid oak and the balance of the house with fir. The entire woodwork is in natural wood stain - no paint being used. The front door is bevel plate glass, copper joined. The doors to the china closet in the large dining room are of the same material. The living room ceiling is of oak beam finish and the furniture of the craftsman finish. A modern basement with furnace, home cellar, laundry, amd coal bins, complete a thoroughly up-to-date building.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Accompanying the home were some lovely old shade trees - a spreading walnut - weeping willow - boxelder - and three heavy bearing apricot trees, together with a large garden plot, corral,</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-46">

    <p>Albert and Jennie Christensen’s 1st home in Manti as it stood when he purchased it in 1900.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-545"></span> barn, buggy shed and small horse-run. In the corral were always a milch cow or two, some chickens, perhaps a few lambs, and father’s thoroughbred horses often lifting their noble heads high over the big corral gates.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Against the backdrop of Albert and Jennie’s two homes and their numerous activities was staged the memorable drama of the family life that we their children knew and cherish. The scenes invite us even now. It was at our first home that I sought father’s sheltering arms in fright at the sight of my first bewhiskered, bell jangling “ho-ho-hoing” Santa Claus, while my younger sister, Elaine, stood up bravely and gave her order — “I want dah and dahbug”. It was here we took our first “space flights” holding tight to the long rope swing secured high up in our poplar trees and operated - by father’s strong arms, It was here we were roused from our beds at midnight and lifted high in those same strong arms to the attic window to view Halley’s Comet, a fiery ball in the sky with a tail of stardust trailing behind. It was father who allayed our fears that with the coming of this comet the world would end, as people were saying.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was with father as guide that we rode in saddlebags through the dense forests to the sheep camp and trembled at the bear stories told by the herder, Tillby, as we went along. It was later, with father’s consent, that we romped over the hills of giant wool sacks at the shearing corral in Christenburg. It was with him we first picnicked at “Devil’s Ribs” and roamed Temple Hill in search of “Indian Eyeballs”. It was he who baited our hooks as we fished for sunfish at Funk’s Lake, or for carp at Nine Mile Reservoir at sundown.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father drove the hayrack in which we crossed the river wheel-deep at Gunnison Ranch to gather redberries and with him we watched the long legged killdeers wading there and listened to their shrill bird cries at eventide. It was with him holding the lines that we rode in the buggy with “Stride On” in the harness on so many happy little trips to see our Danish grandparents, or through the west fields in search of sagebrush for mother to brew for hair rinsings, or merely to discover the first <span id="page-546"></span> wild rose of spring for her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father cautioned us to watch out for rattlesnakes at Flat Canyon as we picked peaches, fished salamanders from the water cistern, or wandered up the canyon of odd shaped rocks nearby, whose formation resembled giant cooking pots all turned topsy-turvy, so aptly called “Hell’s Kitchen”. With father we took our annual birthday trips by train or stage to Richfield, Price and other places he held court. He drove when we took our first car rides, I sitting in the bottom of the back seat of our new Buick eating salty soda crackers to keep from getting “car sick”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was at the new home that we sat with him and mother in the shelter of the broad front porch and watched battles of the elements in the heavens as “Thor swung his great hammer in a rumble of thunder” or “Odin flashed through the sky in his chariot of fire”. There was nothing to fear when father was near. Here we sat in the living room with the firelight from the fireplace reflected in the polished floors and colonnades, while mother read to us and father peeled apples or cracked nuts for our enjoyment. It was here we waited breathlessly at the bend of the staircase for the grate-fire to be prodded into blazing, the wax candles to be lighted on the Christmas tree, and for that most thrill tingling sound of all - father’s “Well, well, well, it looks as if Santa Claus has been here after all!” As if there was ever any doubt of it at our house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was at the San Francisco World Exhibition the summer of 1915 that mother, Elaine and I were shepherded around so expertly by father through the maze of beautiful buildings, exhibits, museums, courts, parks and statuary, with the “Tower of Jewels” looking down over all and pigeons, pigeons everywhere, which we often fed. There were so many things for our wondering eyes to “drink in” - people from all over the world in their native costumes - ex-U. S, president William Howard Taft with silk topped hat, tails and a fancy cane among them. With father we stood hand in hand on the broad steps of the “Court of the Four Winds” and listened in rapture to the chains of silver sound <span id="page-547"></span> rising up from the immense amphitheater below, as the great John Phillip Susa’s band gave a stirring concert. We heard Utah’s own Emma Lucy Gates sing the Star Spangled Banner on “Utah Day” (July 24) at the Fair. It was on this trip we caught our first sight of the Pacific Ocean and witnessed our first and only traditional bull fight in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A happy childhood is like a radiant jewel sparkling on the more somber chain of life - its beauty never dims. This was one of our priceless legacies. During those years, father was our hero, our protector, our Knight in shining armor. We never found cause to fear him nor to doubt him, for he truly loved us. Our home was a sanctuary of joy and peace, where laughter, story telling and music played a big part.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father and mother had some choice friends in Manti during those years - Hattie and Chris Axelson, May and Haze Clark, Eloise and E. D. Sorenson, Delphia and Quince Crawford, Millie and Halburt Kerr, Alice and Dilworth Wooley, Kate and Warren Snow - the L. R. Andersons, J. H. Hornungs, Ray P. Dyrengs, E. T. Reids, Ellis E. Johnsons, Frank Alders - I’m sure I have missed some. Most of the ladies belonged to the Manti Literary Club and the men to the Commercial Club. Their most intimate friends joined them in a “500 Club”. They had wonderful times together.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But there are varieties to living, and happiness does not always endure. In the early evening of Monday, 27 July 1916, in the Covey Apartments in Salt Lake City, five people surrounded the bedsside of Jennie Christensen - her life had just ebbed away. Her aging father, Joseph Snow, stood on the right, with stooped shoulders and eyes cast down in grief. Her sister, Retta Neff, knelt beside him shaken with sobbing. Father stood on the left, bending close to the pillow where mother lay. I knew his heart was breaking but he did not weep - outwardly. I stood near him and held her limp, outstretched hand in both of mine; somehow my fear of death vanished at that moment. Then father rose and put one arm around me - “We must go on <span id="page-548"></span> together without your mother”, he said gently - “We must be brave.” Childhood took leave of me then and never returned. Father was never quite his old self again after that either.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert continued to serve as District Judge until his term ran out in 1917, but declined to stand for renomination although both parties indicated a desire to place him on their tickets. His duties as Judge necessitated long absences from home and he felt he needed to be near his five motherless children. So he brought his energies back to the private practice of law, the running of sheep, the operation of his two ranches plus some semi-private business projects.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After Jennie’s death his sister Vena came into the home for a time to assist him. Then Jennie’s sister, Retta Neff, came to help and brought her children while her husband was away studying for his doctorate. Occasional hired girls followed but proved to be poor substitutes for a mother. Sometimes of necessity the children were left to carry on alone - but not often. After nearly four years of this, Albert found a wonderful helpmate in Miss Myrtle Farnsworth, the Domestic Science teacher in the local High School and a younger sister of Ida, lovely wife of Edgar T. Reid, who lived neighbors across the road.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert and Myrtle were married in the St. George Temple, 23 June 1920. She was almost thirty-five and he was forty-seven and a half. His children lovingly called her Aunt Myrtle from then on and she had an outstanding influence for good on their lives from the beginning. Albert was then tied up in a huge land investment known as the “Starr Ranch”. Myrtle understood about it before their marriage, since Albert had told her that if the venture succeeded, all would be wonderful, but that if it failed he would be literally “wiped out”. Myrtle was willing to take the chance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert’s brother, Andrew, had interested him in this venture, a large ranch in Juab County north of Nephi, the possibilities of which, to Andrew at least, seemed enormous. Though Albert was not as enthusiastic as the less conservative Andrew, <span id="page-549"></span> yet he had let himself become involved when an organization was set up among three major stockholders: Andrew (A. B.), his brother-in-law, Otis L. Ercanbrack, and Albert (A. H.), with a view to purchasing livestock and real estate on a large scale from the Starr Land and Development Company.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With A. B. as president of the new company and A. H. as secretary, a special meeting of stockholders had been held 24 Nov. 1919 in Nephi, where the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:— “Resolved to buy said property from the Starr Land and Development Company, the cost to be paid as follows: Total price $130,000 with $35,000 down in cash, the assumption of a $20,000 mortgage to the State of Utah then carried on the property, the balance of $75,000 to be assured by three promissory notes, one for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1920, another for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1921, another for $55,000 due ten years from date of purchase, with 6% interest overall - and in addition, the crops raised and harvested upon said land during the year 1920 to be mortgaged as future security for the note due in 1920, and the 1921 crops mortgaged to secure the note due in December of that year.” So the deal had been made and became valid and binding upon all concerned.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This proved to be the most disastrous step Albert ever took. Being at the height of the post-war boom of World War I, these stockholders were not spared when the post-war depression followed shortly. Albert was forced to mortgage all he owned to try and keep things going, as well as to borrow all additional he could. Lastly, he was forced to turn over his lovely home and most all else he had to his creditors, and besides was left under a staggering load of debt which at the time must have loomed as impossible for him to surmount.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In August of 1925 Albert and his family loaded up their remaining belongings and moved to Provo, Utah. Phillip, almost fourteen at the time, tells of this move:— “Then came the move from Manti to Provo. It was made with two hayracks, Uncle Arthur Christensen driving one and <span id="page-550"></span> my brothers Sherman and Hale the other. I rode with them as far as Salt Creek Canyon and then got tired of the whole transaction, for we burned out a boxing and had to camp for a day or two until we could get a replacement. Father came along in the old car and took me into Provo where he had taken Aunt Myrtle and the rest. He had arranged to rent a house in northeast Provo but it wasn’t ready when we got there so we stayed for a few weeks with some of Aunt Myrtle’s relatives; first the Ashworths and then the Abner Tanners until our house was ready. They were wonderful to us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We lived about nine months in Provo and then father bought an old home on an eight acre farm from M. B. Cutler, who had two wives, each deaf and dumb and living in separate homes. When we first looked at this old home, the Mrs. Cutler who lived there lovingly patted the furnace, about the only modern thing in the place. Aunt Myrtle soon made it look and feel like home however, and later an inside bathroom was installed and other improvements made. Here we had rows and rows of raspberries and strawberries, cats and cows, and an old horse, Molly, who pulled the cultivator for us through the rows of berries. Father and I planted fruit trees, apple, peach and cherry, together with a large garden.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was no small task for Albert to reestablish himself, start a new law practice with few contacts and very little backing and to build a career, almost as from the beginning. Though past middle age and heavily weighted down by debt, he found sufficient reason to go on fighting. Perhaps it was his Viking blood that urged him. Even though his debts ran into many times ten thousand and more, he resolved to pay back every dollar.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was seemingly no end to the sorrow and additional expense he was called upon to endure those next few fateful years. On July 23, 1926 his brother Joseph passed away. Sept. 4, 1927 his sister Emma died. The next spring there was much illness among his loved ones. His elderly father was suffering untold misery from diabetic ulcers; his father-in-law was in bad shape with cancer and his son Hale was in constant distress <span id="page-551"></span> with a then undetermined illness. Albert divided his limited time among them, doing whatever he could for each. His father-in-law passed away 3 Aug. 1928 in Salt Lake City. Albert was on hand when the end came and again at Manti when last rites were conducted for the fine old gentleman, Joseph S. Snow. Nov. 10, 1928 he was called from Hale’s sickbed to the deathbed of his own father, L. M. C. Christensen, who was laid to rest a few days later in the Manti cemetery and whose suffering had been long and heart-rending.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale had been operated on that mid-July but this failed to disclose the trouble or cure it. However a second operation near mid-October had revealed his condition to be grave. After that he never left the L. D. S. Hospital in Salt Lake City until his death of internal cancer, 9 Mar. 1929. Albert wrote of this:— “This morning at 5:40 a.m, our dearest Hale passed away - that same wonderful boy that he has shown himself to be throughout this terrible but unequal struggle. While my heart is grieved beyond words, I thank God that his awful ordeal is over. His has been an example that should help us all to carry on properly under all conditions. His memory to me will be a staff for whatever may befall us. I am proud to be the father of such a boy.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A little past five months after Hale’s death a baby girl, their third and last child, was born to Albert and Myrtle. They called her Kathryn and she brought a ray of bright sunshine from without the gloom. But the sorrows went on. Before Kathryn was a week old, Myrtle’s beloved sister, Ida Reid, was crushed to death in a car accident. Myrtle held up bravely but there were still more partings for her to endure. A bolt out of the blue came with word of her father’s passing, the last of November 1931. Myrtle’s mother came from Beaver to live with them then, but exactly one month after her husband’s death, the sweet little old lady was killed by a fall at the home in Orem.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In between these last two deaths, on 17 Dec. 1931, came word of the unexpected passing of Albert’s brother, Andrew, all alone in a strange hotel in St. George, Utah. The grim reaper made yet another call on Albert’s loved ones when less <span id="page-552"></span> than a year later, 4 Dec. 1932, his brother Arthur passed away after surgery. Some seem to be tested more than others at times and Albert was one of these. His cup of sorrow must have been near to running over during those difficult years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By then the country was in the midst of the great depression. Banks were closed, jobs were at a premium and many people were hungry. Though Albert had all the legal business he could handle, and more, collections were hard to make since most of his clients had little available money. Nor was his health the best, for the strain and pressures of recent years had begun to take their toll. Above all was the fact that he was still heavily burdened by debt. He had worked almost night and day, and his family had worked and saved and gone without along with him, with but one end in mind - that of freeing him from debt. Friends had advised him to take out bankruptcy - many were doing it. He flatly refused although at times pressured almost beyond endurance by some of his creditors. He was in dead earnest about paying off all of his obligations with interest, as soon as time and circumstance would permit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">During the long, hard pull, his home, his beloved family, his small fruit farm, together with his great faith in a Divine Power, were his strength and his refuge. Indeed he couldn’t have continued the struggle without these. He couldn’t have gotten along without Myrtle, who managed his household so expertly and with such courage and kindliness. The way she stood by him, giving hope and encouragement, will be forever to her credit. He couldn’t have managed without the love and cooperation of his children and the pride and satisfaction he had in their accomplishments. He looked forward to family associations - birthday parties - picnics - hunting and fishing trips - reunions - just daily little visits - but especially the glorious Christmas Eve family home evenings in which everyone took a special part and which were never neglected as long as he lived.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His daughter Kathryn writes of his later years:— “Dad was fifty-six when I was born. By the time I was a teenager he was sixty-nine and <span id="page-553"></span> when I reached college age he was seventy-four. We worked out a fine relationship. I always thought of him as loving and kind, but the characteristics I remember most were his great dignity, scrupulous honesty, and his pride in us children. I remember him saying on occasions when his family was all gathered around him that he could not conceive of Heaven being much more wonderful than this.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember serious talks with Dad, and I recall the loving way he’d take my hand and would rub my thumb and knuckles in a circular movement of his large thumb. He placed constant emphasis upon us being more than just “scrub” or common run-of-the-mill. Somehow he managed to make us children feel that we had an obligation, because of our heritage, to be contributing, worthwhile members of society. He would not compromise on the kind of school grades he expected. I usually left a list of my grades on the mantlepiece where he put his car keys and under which he always carefully placed his high topped shoes at end of day. If ever there was anything besides an “A” on that list, no matter how many “A’s” there were, he would say, “Well, let’s see if we can do a little better next time.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Most of my life I felt that it was necessary to be very careful financially, although I know that by the time I began to grow up things were easier than earlier. There always seemed enough money for music lessons and schooling however. All Dad asked in return was that we take advantage of these opportunities. He wanted us to develop our talents to the fullest. Countless times I have been grateful for the fine education he was willing to provide for me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I can still remember the look of joy on my parents’ faces when Dad came home from the office sometime during the last of World War II to tell us he was finally out of debt. His honesty, integrity, courage and determination have been a great inspiration to me and helped me to understand that there is little in life that cannot be faced successfully in the long run, if these characteristics have been developed within. As the giver of gifts of life <span id="page-554"></span> that were most meaningful and precious our father was most generous and gracious.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember Dad as a man of the soil. From early spring to late fall he and mother would rise around 5:00 a.m. He would work in the garden until 7:00, have his breakfast, and then prepare to leave for the office by 8:00. He would often spend around two hours in the garden again after his full day at the office. His loving care showed in his gardens and orchards. They were beautiful to behold, and kept a never failing supply of fresh vegetables and fruits on our table all summer and fall, with plenty for mother to bottle for use during the rest of the year. His ability with the irrigation water seemed magical; mother said it seemed like water would run uphill for Dad. Helping him plant corn, potatoes and beans are rather special memories to me and family fruit-harvesting-parties were the “greatest”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Some of the more humorous aspects of life with Dad always cause a chuckle within my heart. Dad did enjoy driving nice cars! The first car I remember was a green 1936 Plymouth which pulled our housetrailer all over the United States for our vacation in that year. The next was a blue Chrysler Highlander with red plaid and leather seat covers. This was the car I learned to drive and used so much. When it came to getting a new car in 1947, Dad said in mock seriousness that he was going to get a Ford. When the time came for the debut, he chose a Sunday morning. He took mother and me to Sunday School in the old car and then went to get the new. When Sunday School let out, there was Dad out in front of Lincoln High School, where our ward held church then, in a brand new 1947 Lincoln with push button doors and windows. Picture if you can all the men and boys of the ward crowded around that gorgeous car! Finally, as mother and I were able to get through the crowd and into the car, Dad found he couldn’t get it started. So many people had tried the battery-powered windows that the battery had gone dead. A substantial amount of glory vanished amid calls of “Why don’t you get a horse?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was in the Lincoln that Dad, mother, a <span id="page-555"></span> granddaughter, Colleen Keeler, and I drove back to attend the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia the summer of 1948. Dad was an official delegate from Utah to that convention which nominated Thomas E. Dewey for the U. S. Presidency. Dad was a lifelong Republican and it was quite a blow when he and Dewey awoke to find that Harry Truman had won the election. There were so many other Republican defeats during those years that election day, until Eisenhower’s victory, was always followed by a time of gloom at our house. To me, Dad was “Mr. Republican of Utah” and I feel that our nation would be better off if there were more as sincerely and vitally interested in politics as he.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The proud Lincoln car came to a rather unceremonious end. The Provo Herald of Friday June 4, 1954, carried the story:— “Judge and Mrs. A. H. Christenson, Orem, and two grandchildren narrowly escaped death late Thursday when their car overturned in a canal. The car rolled over two and a half times and landed upside down in Carterville canal. Mr. Christenson, 81, was pinned against the floor of the overturned car.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mrs. Christenson, seeing the outstretched hands of one granddaughter, Kay Webster, as she clung to the front car seat, hauled her through the water filled top of the car, which rested on the bottom of the canal, and up to air and light. She pushed the button, rolling down the car windows, and helped the little girl out onto the canal bank. Still a prisoner herself, she helped the second little granddaughter, Sue Webster, to duck under the water and up out of the window. However, it was impossible for the two older persons to get out of the half submerged car without aid, so she urged the drenched children, shivering on the bank, to call for help. An unidentified motorist stopped. One boy in the car assisted Judge and Mrs. Christenson in freeing themselves and the other drove off to get help.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The grandchildren, daughters of Reed J. and Norma C. Webster of Salt Lake City, had just arrived for a vacation with their grandparents and the four were on their way to Provo Canyon for <span id="page-556"></span> supper. Thick branches helped to cushion the fall of the sedan as it sank into the stream.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A lovely new 1954 Buick replaced the Lincoln in Albert’s garage. This was his last car. His very first car had also been a Buick for, if memory holds true, he owned one of the first if not the first Buick in Manti. Though he was without a car off and on during the years when things were so difficult, most of the cars he had were of the best. Fine cars were some of the very few personal extravagances Albert ever allowed himself.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kathryn adds:— “Dad had been an excellent and safe driver. Driving and feeling independent were of course very important - so important to him that perhaps he drove too long. I recall how he ‘revved up’ the motor there on the south side of the house in Orem, and then the inevitable honking and screeching of brakes as he entered upon Highway 91 with considerable determination. One of the frustrations of his last years was when the authorities would no longer renew his drivers license. The boys came for him lots towards the end of his life and the Buick remained in the service shop from time to time.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One by one each of his three living sons joined his law firm and began to handle more and more of the load, leaving Albert added time for recreation. He spent more time digging around in his small fruit farm, played a little golf and chess, and evidenced a special weakness for “Five Hundred.” This latter he often indulged when his children and their companions dropped in of an evening. Many lively contests of skill were held with the family gathered around the dining room table, and with Aunt Myrtle usually ending up bringing in a plateful of her famous “caramels” to treat both winners and losers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert loved to be out in the mountains. He went deer hunting almost every fall with his boys and others, during which time he got “nary a deer.” Most folks said it was because he hadn’t the heart to shoot the poor things, but his son Phillip said this just wasn’t so - his father was just a poor shot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-557"></span> But all this was before that “special hunt” of which Phillip tells;— “Father was nearing eighty when he and a son-in-law, Dan Keeler, and myself went on a deer hunt southeast of Strawberry. We arrived on Willow Creek Ridge shortly after daylight and parked our car. I shot my buck within minutes. Dan walked out along the ridge and down into a little draw covered with brush, tossing small rocks and twigs on either side as he went. Suddenly antlers appeared in the brush ahead of him - one quick shot felled the two pointer. Coming back up onto the ridge Dan met father. ‘Do you want to get a deer’he said. ‘Sure’ said father. Dan instructed him to go down into another little draw nearby and gently throw rocks and twigs, as he had done. Father disappeared into the draw as I joined Dan on top the ridge. We were standing there talking of our successes when - ‘Bang! Bang!’ came from the brush below - then all was still. I shouted, “Have any luck?’ In a minute an excited answer came back; ‘I sure did and he’s a WHOPPER!’ We three mighty hunters returned to Orem with our three bucks and father’s four pointer topped the kill. It was his first and last. This was a great day for father.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were many “great days” for Albert in his later years. They were great days for him when he saw his children graduate from college; when he saw his daughters taking part as “leading ladies” in operas, oratorios and dramas; when he saw his grandsons serving foreign missions for the Church. June 26, 1954 was a great day for Albert for he saw his oldest son, after having been nominated by President Eisenhower and confirmed by the United States Senate, sworn in to fill one of the highest judicial offices a Utahn could hold, that of Federal Judge of Utah. It was a great day for Albert when he himself, together with Myrtle, was able to return to the beautiful St. George Temple, this time to work for the salvation of the dead.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sherman writes:— “Perhaps one of the richest parts of father’s life was as he and Aunt Myrtle established a new home in Orem, as he became one of the leading trial attorneys in the <span id="page-558"></span> State and its recognized authority on irrigation law, and in this new setting a venerable citizen, honored, respected and revered.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes when I went to father with my problems he would listen carefully and then, instead of giving any particular solutions, would merely counter with the question, “Are you a thoroughbred or a mongrel?” I then knew what I must do, though the doing be hard. He expected much of his children but he demanded far more of himself. He had little patience for mediocrity in those who could do better but for the weak his sympathy was endless.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father was a tall man; tall in character as well as stature. He was a man of self-restraint and great dignity. Yet his dignity was tempered with a kindness and humility that would stoop unseen to place a silver dollar in the hand of a wistful child. During most of his mature years he was on the “giving end” of life. Not half his charities have ever been told. To me he was a thoroughbred in every sense of the word.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must have been another great day for Albert “H” Christensen when, Mar. 13, 1957, his spirit took flight. So many must have been waiting “over-there” to greet him - his beloved wife Jennie - his dear son Hale - his cherished parents - his brothers and sisters, together with the kind Chris “I” of whom he had dreamed so vividly not long before. Surely his grandsire Christen Christensen must have been on hand, along with others of his worthy ancestors. Think you some of the more ancient of these may have been among the welcomers - those who once rowed or stood commanding at the helm of high-masted Viking ships with carved wooden dragonheads pointing the way?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kathryn writes:— “I was married and living in the east when father died, three months to the day following his eighty-fourth birthday. He has remained in my memory as the vigorous, spirited man that he was the last time I saw him in life. I arrived home just in time for his funeral and to see him, as if peacefully sleeping, as I had seen him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“All his later life father dreamed of going to Denmark. In fact he at one time even began making serious preparations for such a trip. He had instilled in us children a pride in our Danish heritage. It may be that I was the first of his descendants to see that beautiful country in his stead (1959). How proud he would have been to see that Lovely Land. How proud I was when I saw it. And how proud I am of him.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Ellen Virginia or “Jennie” Snow Christensen, first wife of Albert “H” was born 28 Jan. 1878 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. She was the fourth child and second daughter of nine children born to Joseph Smith Snow and Lucy Ellen Van Buren, early Mormon Pioneers of English and Dutch descent.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A history of her life is included in the volume, “Cheney Garrett Van Buren and His Family”, published by this writer in 1962. Others have written about Jennie S. Christensen and all are agreed that she was an unusual and outstanding individual. Albert, writing of his first meeting with her, states:— “There seemed no doubt in my mind from that first evening but that she would fit completely into my hopes and life. She had taught school, attended the University of Utah, was very intelligent and possessed a grace that greatly appealed to me. Our visits became regular and increasingly agreeable to both of us and it was not long before we became mutually convinced that life together was promising and inevitable.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elaine describes her thus:— “She was small of stature, but she walked like a queen; her eyes were large, blue and misty, but searching and appreciative; her hair was dark and rich, curling the way nature wanted it to; her mouth was sweet and provocative, but spoke wisdom and truth; her hands were small and square, but tender and creative.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Prestwich, who was stage manager at <span id="page-560"></span> the Moroni Theatre, commented that Jennie Snow had the most beautiful speaking voice he had ever heard and could have been the top actress of her day had she not preferred marriage to a career.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes, when sleep eludes me, I fancy I see mother Jennie as she lived and breathed among us. ‘Tis strange what childhood impressions linger. I seem to feel her many moods and to be swept along in the circle of her activities. The pictures I see are quite vivid. I never see her angry, but I see her fearful - fearful when our horse runs away, tipping the buggy over and throwing the four of us into the mud, just before her third baby is expected, and little Elaine, filled with her own wee worry, cries and points to her muddy shoes, demanding, “Take doz off!” I see mother fearful of childbirth, for she is small and her babies are large and there is little modern medical knowledge to assist her - her own mother died in childbirth. I see her fearful when little Sherman, who is what they call a hemophiliac, gets the nosebleed; fearful when father, exhausted from a hard day at the herd or ranch, goes to sleep in the bathtub and shakes the place with his snoring while she, sure he will drown himself, pounds frantically on the bathroom door and tries to pick the lock, as we children all take up the pounding and shout to try and wake him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see mother happy and busy at sewing with us children taking turns threading the machine for her. I see her stencilling borders of acorns, tulips and other motifs on scrim for bedroom curtains for the “rose-room” with its solid mahogany furniture, the “blue room” with its birdseye maple, and the “buff room”. I see her deep-frying timbale shells and chicken croquettes for parties and openhouses and making dainty little nutbread and boston-brown bread sandwiches and letting Elaine and I help trim off the crusts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we come downstairs on cold winter mornings, I see her benevolent as she spreads steaming hot, nourishing breakfasts on the small kitchen table for some of the local less-fortunates. In summers I see her giving generous “hand outs” to roving tramps, gypsies and Indians. Though they <span id="page-561"></span> are only roomers, she sends trays bearing tasty breakfasts up to the blue-room for two out-of-town lady school teachers with whom we are sharing our new home one winter - because they can find no other place to stay.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see mother sitting patiently in a chair near the Baldwin piano, counting out the time, over and over again, as I practice for my piano lesson. “Sing the little verse that goes with this piece,” she says; “I would like Professor Woodward to see how well you can play and sing together.” So I practice and she sings along with me in her rich contralto. “Sing robin from your woodland tree; Sing robin, sing a song for me; I love your pretty melody; sing little robin, sing.” She kisses me as I leave for my lesson. “Play and sing your best”, she says. At the studio Mr, Woodward is entertaining his sweetheart and I feel hesitant about singing. Yet I seat myself at the piano and begin to play my piece and sing, as mother has told me. “Just play the piece and skip the singing,” says my teacher rather sharply. I go home to dear mother, crying and indignant because it seems he has insulted her. “Never mind,” she says; “someday we’ll show Professor Woodward just how lovely you can sing.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see mother patient with girls she has hired - skinny little Miss Lazenby who eats up all the leftovers saying, “Eat ‘em to save ‘em,” and Venice, who gets sick so much that mother is forever having to wait on her instead of the other way around. Good hired girls are so hard to find yet so much needed to help with our big new house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see her without a hired girl and with father away, weary at the close of day yet bravely trying to wrestle all four of us children at once as she gives us our Saturday night baths in the twin sanitary tubs in the basement; Hale and Sherman in one tub, Elaine and I in the other. One or the other of us keeps getting turned head over heels in those deep, slick tubs and comes up from the water gasping and screaming. I see her giving us our supper later in the kitchen and making our favorite “Lumpy Dick” as a last resort, and serving it hot with extra sugar. <span id="page-562"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see her basking in the joy she finds in our lovely home - in the big dining room with brown embossed leatherette fabric on the wainscotings, papered scenes of forests in colors of green, brown and gold on the walls above and “blue willow” china plates on the plate rails. She often steals away here for a moment to write and we children know just where to find her. She loves the small east window on the second landing of the stairway, whose crystal prisms cast rainbows of color from the sun’s first rays or the beams of a rising moon. How often we stand together and watch the full moon through that prism-bordered window.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I see mother ill and hardly able to walk though still courageous, after the birth of little Phillip, staying upstairs in the Rose-room or being carried downstairs in the strong arms of father. I see her struggling to regain her health by faithfully taking “Susanna Schowcroft’s Physical Exercises”, which she orders by mail; I see her powdering the backs of her hands to soothe the clusters of tiny itching red blisters which are aggravated by both heat and water and forerunners of the acute Bright’s disease that is eventually to take her. I see her embarrassed by the sores on these same precious hands, so covering them with gloves whenever she goes out in public.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But mostly I see mother Jennie as the talented, creative, enthusiastic and wonderful woman all who really knew her remember. Her vibrant, outgoing personality radiated courage and faith and a deep love for all of our Heavenly Father’s creations. As Elaine wrote, “Jennie loved everything beautiful: the sighing of the wind in the elms, the chirp of crickets in the hush of evening, the raspy rustling of corn in the shock, the changing panorama of clouds in a ribboned sky, the lyrical rippling of waters, the consonant music of nature, or the dissonant music of life.” In fact, Jennie loved life. Though she was very human her spirit seemed to soar above the clouds of ordinary living and was able to take others with it to some degree, especially us, her children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Even from the beginning, her vivid imagination and power of poetic expression made the things <span id="page-563"></span> about us live and tingle in our minds and hearts. She gave us new eyes, new ears, new understanding. And while she entertained and delighted us, she taught and disciplined in poetry, song and story. She ran the gamut of noble emotions from the simple to the sublime, and we followed along. She tuned the strings of our creative impulses and made them want to sing!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Her children’s stories were unforgettable and had their settings in places familiar to our experiences. The one about the “Two Little Mud Girls”, Dottie and Pearl who came to life, might easily have taken place in the garden and barnyard of our first home, for here were chickens, currant bushes, often toadstools that came up after a rain, Madsen’s unfriendly pigeons that roosted in our barn, stray cats, our granary next to the barn that was plagued with mice. Uncle Gard and Aunt Esther Snow’s white ducks that swam in the big irrigation ditch between our two yards, and plenty of nice, clean, soft dirt for making mud pies. “Be careful little mud girls - the world is very big and you are very little,” said the friendly chicken to Pearl and Dottie; but the advice was really for little Elaine and Virginia, given by their loving mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Longshanks and Tockadoo” could have been set in our old barnyard. Sometimes even now, when I’m tempted to brag, I think of the rooster Tockadoo and his bedraggled tail feathers. The story of “Old Thunder and the White Cloud” must have had its setting in the old County Block, not far from our home. “Two sisters and a Prince” brought forcefully to mind the old adage: “Beauty is as beauty does”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Old Santa Claus”, a happy Christmas adventure in verse, was made up by mother for me to give at a school Christmas program when I was around nine; in fact, the Christmas we first spent in our new home. She dictated the last part of it to me while she was mixing bread the morning just before the program. She helped me memorize the poem within the hour, with appropriate gestures, emphasis and inflections. For more than fifty years since then her descendants, to the third generation, have retold this Christmas poem at as <span id="page-564"></span> many Christmas Eve family home evenings. Her beautiful Christmas song, “One Christmas Day”, for which she composed both words and music, has also been given by her descendants on numbers of such occasions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was some time before she wrote “Old Santa Claus” that mother began training Elaine and me to sing and dance and do dramatic skits together. As I remember, our initial public performance was in “Bobby Shafto”, a sad tale in song, which we presented in conjunction with a Stake Primary Carnival in the Manti Tabernacle. A friend, Maud Ewing, took the boy’s part and Elaine and I were the two sisters. Aunt Retta Neff rushed into town the day before the performance, bringing beautiful old fashioned bonnets and long, full dresses for Elaine and me to wear. We were asked to repeat “Bobby Shafto” at a later date and our cousin, Reva Riddle, took the boy’s part then.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For several successive years after that Elaine and I were featured on yearly money raising variety shows put on by the Primary in conjunction with the local picture shows. Each year our names and pictures in costume appeared on bulletin boards outside the theatre; they seemed to think our acts were some sort of “drawing cards.” One year we were a Dutch couple with appropriate costumes and real wooden shoes. We sang “Lena, my Lena Smidt” and did a noisy Dutch clog. Another year we were an Indian couple and still another we were a couple of village “rubes” singing “Mornin’ Cy, Howdy Cy, Gosh darn Cyrus but you’re lookin’ spry.” Then we locked arms shoulder high in the latest and most daring fashion and did a ragtime dance that brought the house down. Mother certainly knew how to put a song and dance together and what she didn’t know Aunt Retta could add.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I always remember mother looking her very best whether at home or in public. I never saw her untidy, unless occasional errant curls straying over her brow could be called such. When she went out in public with our tall father as her escort she liked to appear as tall as possible. Then she pinned her curls high on top of her head and topped them with a bob fashioned from a switch she had hired <span id="page-565"></span> made from her own hair combings. She wore the highest heels she could buy on her small two-and-a-half size shoes, which had to be special ordered through the local merchants. I seldom saw her in bright colored apparel, for she most always wore the darker shades of brown, gray, blue, green, and of course black. Perhaps this is why I remember so well the dress she wore on that last New Year’s Eve when she attended a dinner dance with father. It was an evening gown of softest salmon pink satin with long, fitted skirt and elbow length sleeves. Over each shoulder ran several narrow pink satin straps, each centered with a small black satin button. I stood on a chair beside her with needle and thread and tacked the straps in place to please her. Long, black silk gloves completed her costume. Mother looked so beautiful to me that night. Seven months from then she was in her grave.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Aside from the memory of that wonderful woman,” Sherman writes, “time has left us nothing more closely touching her character and very being than the fragments of her soul which she placed upon paper. In her children’s stories she brought two little mud girls to life, not to mention the animals and birds and flowers that she translated into mortality for the delight of young minds. In her more serious poems she caught the most profound undertones of humanity and religion for the delight of the soul. (Included in this category is “The Wise Man,” which won for her first place in the Deseret News Christmas poetry contest of 1910.) Between the two, in verse and story, she has woven a golden mesh of love and devotion, courage and pathos, romance and happiness for the delight of the heart.” May we share two of her lovely poems?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It has been more than sixty years since Jennie Snow Christensen sang her songs and dreamed her dreams, yet her songs and dreams continue to live, but especially in the hearts of us, her children. I am sure I myself have fallen far short of her expectations, yet the memory of this precious mother has sparked some of my noblest efforts, humble though they have been. She made her limited life one of boundless giving of the beauty of her spirit, like a <span id="page-567"></span> delicate white blossom sending forth such beautiful and lasting fragrance as to almost defy description.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle Farnsworth Christensen, second wife of Albert “H”, was born 30 July 1885. She could be proud of her heritage for all four of her grandparents were early Utah Mormon Pioneers worthy of note. Her maternal grandfather, Marcus D’Lafette Shepherd, whose father had been an aide-de-camp to General George Washington during the American Revolution, became a member of the Mormon Battalion, was in on the gold rush in California and panned gold at Sutter’s Mill. Returning to Salt Lake City he presented his sweetheart, Harriet Editha Pharish, with a sack of gold nuggets as a wedding gift. They settled first in San Bernadino Valley but later sold their property there for a goodly sum of money and used this to buy machinery with which to set up a woolen mill in Beaver, Utah, where they were called to colonize by Brigham Young. A cotton mill in St. George and a shoe factory in Parawan were set up about the same time by others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle’s paternal grandfather, Philo Taylor Farnsworth, who migrated to Utah with the early Saints in 1848, was immediately called to go back to Winter Quarters with wagons and supplies to assist in bringing destitute saints to Utah. Again and again he made these trips and on one of them met a young English convert, Margaret Yates. He helped her to come to Zion, where they were wed. The couple were sent south to Fillmore, Utah to help settle that place, but later, in 1856, Brother Farnsworth was called to Beaver to become Bishop there. Myrtle’s father was then but a young child. Her grandfather became a polygamist and had four wives and thirty children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Farnsworth and Shepherd children grew up together in Beaver. The Farnsworths had many struggles trying to feed and clothe their large family, but were enterprising and hard working. The Shepherds were considered well-to-do and their children were given every advantage. In <span id="page-568"></span> 1866 Brother Shepherd built the first brick home in Beaver, a huge eighty by thirty three-story dwelling modeled after the Prophet Joseph Smith’s home in Nauvoo. It was long called “The Shepherd Mansion”. He also built a brick granary nearby. Among the furnishings in this home was a large grand piano which the Shepherds secured when Fort Cameron was abandoned by the U. S. Soldiers. It had been brought in for the wife of the Fort’s Major and was said to be the only such piano in the valleys then, except the one owned by President Brigham Young.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Myrtle’s parents, William Henry Farnsworth and Harriet Susanna Shepherd, were first married they lived in Beaver for a while where her father worked first as a telegrapher and then in a store. He then homesteaded some farming land about nineteen miles north of Beaver at what was known as Pine Creek Ranch. Here in the ranch shack of logs Myrtle was born, the fourth of seven children. When she was two and her new baby brother was six months, their father left on a mission to England for the L. D. S. Church. Her mother and the five children went to live in the Shepherd Mansion, where grandfather Shepherd took care of them for the thirty months Myrtle’s father was away.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">During his absence grandmother Shepherd died. Upon her father, William Farnsworth’s return, he and his wife and family were given the large home and grandfather Shepherd went to live with his polygamist wife a block away. Myrtle’s father was made manager of the Beaver Woolen Mills and served as such for the next five years. The large home was remodeled to better fit the needs of the Farnsworth family. Though several bedrooms occupied one wing of the second floor, a large recreation hall 50 by 30 ft. occupied the other. Community meetings, programs and dances were held here. The old brick granary was turned into the city jail for a time. Many’s the tale that could be told of those days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle’s mother had several sisters and they and their families flocked back to the old home on many occasions. Myrtle and her sisters and cousins <span id="page-569"></span> had free access to the large attic and their grandmother Shepherd’s trunks of beautiful clothes and bonnets she had brought across the plains, as well as to the old spinning wheel. Many were the home dramatics held by candlelight in that old attic. Myrtle’s mother’s family was a singing family and all used to sing around the table following a family meal in the huge dining room. Her mother, Harriet, and her Aunt Sadie often accompanied them on their guitars.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Early day Beaver was very educationally minded and prided itself on its good spellers, grammarians, mathematicians, as well as singers. The small town was blessed with excellent music teachers. This, together with native ability and training in the home, was an advantage to Myrtle and her brothers and sisters and they all sang well. Myrtle can hardly remember when she couldn’t sing alto. She joined the Ward choir when in her early teens - they all did. Later her brother Karl sang in the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir for years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle grew up in Beaver among her four sisters and two brothers and cousins by the dozens. She was a healthy, pretty girl, rather large for her age, and with an inner urge towards tomboyishness which she felt was very distasteful to her prim little mother and sedate older sisters. She had an optimistic and happy nature and a generous heart and she was loved by many.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At that time most of the Farnsworth family’s clothing was made from Woolen Mill products, or from cotton cloth they traded for from the cotton mills in St. George. Every garment was remodeled and passed down as long as there was anything of it left. The family shoes were secured by trading woolen goods from their Beaver mill for high button shoes made at the Parawan Shoe Factory. Though they may have thought these shoes ugly and ill-fitting, it was their patriotic duty to wear them nevertheless. Though fundamentally plain in her tastes, Myrtle longed for pretty clothes, and her first pair of “real store shoes” was an experience she treasured with happiness. <span id="page-570"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">She attended the first four grades at the Beaver District school in the three-room school house, heated by an old pot-bellied stove with a long stovepipe that ran overhead across the room, which was always falling down and sending a shower of soot upon the slates and copy books.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She attended fifth grade at B. Y. U. Training School in Provo where her mother took the children for the winter while her father did some remodeling on the home. Returning to Beaver, Myrtle skipped sixth grade and took seventh and eighth grades in turn. She was among the seven to be graduated from the eighth grade of Beaver District school in 1889.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From the time Myrtle was old enough to dream of a life of service she had a longing to teach. It was sometime while attending elementary school in Beaver that she began to teach in the Sunday School. From then on she taught Sunday School some place or another every single year for some thirty years and then off and on for another fifteen, making a total of some forty-five years she served as a teacher in the Sunday Schools of the Church.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following her graduation from eighth grade she stayed out of school a year to help in the home. She acted as tithing clerk in her Ward that year. The fall of 1900 she entered the Murdock Academy, which had taken over the place once known as Fort Cameron near Beaver and was in its third year. She completed three years of high school work there the spring of 1903, which was all the Academy offered at that time. She then attended summer school at B. Y. U. and in the fall began her long-dreamed-of public teaching career in the little town of Frisco in southern Utah, where she taught the first four grades that winter of 1903/04. From here on she became self-supporting and also was able to assist other members of her family in getting their educations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The summer and winter of 1904/05 she attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City to complete her work for a Normal certificate. Here she walked off with the honor of being among the three highest in scholarship for the four quarters. <span id="page-571"></span> The next winter she taught fifth and sixth grades in the Farmington District school and then went to summer school at the Utah State Agricultural College in Logan.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fall of 1906 Myrtle went to Manti to teach and taught there three successive winters, teaching fifth grade, first grade and seventh grade in turn. It was here she first met the lawyer A. H. Christensen, who was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Manti High School and closely associated with her brother-in-law, Edgar T. Reid. But she thought nothing of it at the time. She spent the three alternate summers in summer school, the first at the A. C. and the next two at the U. of U. She then returned to her home town of Beaver where she taught the fourth grade that winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For quite a while a desire had been growing within her to learn more about sewing. It was impossible to buy well-fitting, properly styled dresses in most towns in Utah. Women had to depend on their own untrained abilities or on the services of expensive, busy and mostly poorly-trained dressmakers. Myrtle believed if women could be taught to make their own clothes skillfully that this would add a great deal to their lives. So she stayed at home in Beaver the following year, taking a correspondence course from the “Brown’s School of Sewing” of Salt Lake City during the summer and fall and doing a great deal of professional sewing during the winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But again, she may have stayed home that winter mainly because of a very serious matrimonial decision she was required to make. Sewing gave her more time to think than teaching. She finally decided against marrying at that time because of a difference in religious ideals. This was only one of several such decisions she had to make over the next few years however, for besides being so well trained she was excellent company, very popular, and a beautiful woman, all in all. She was much sought after, even by a certain polygamist whose proposal of marriage she turned down with much distaste, She allowed herself to become engaged twice - but broke those engagements. It <span id="page-572"></span> seemed that marriage was not for her at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The summer of 1911 she again went to summer school at the A. C. in Logan for the first session, then attended the “Kiester Sewing School” there the latter part of the summer. Then she returned to teaching, this time at the Cove School in the very small community of Sevier, some miles south of Richfield, Utah. Here she spent the next three winters, teaching the first four elementary grades the first winter and acting as Principal the next two. Some of her choicest memories stem from that period, as she felt she was performing a very worthy mission there aside from her school responsibilities.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Unlike the preceding teachers in the small community of Sevier, who commuted back and forth much of the time, Myrtle took up her residence there where they had never sent out a missionary, never had an eighth grade graduate, never had an M. I. A. organization, and where the people, old and young, were literally starved for the finer things of life and truly neglected. Under her direction the small schoolhouse became a hub of activity during those three winters. The Sunday School was reactivated and an M. I. A. organized, On M. I. A. nights young and old came from farm houses near and far with lanterns and lamps to light the small school house, pleading to stay “just a little longer” as they listened to the reading of a fine novel, some bits of poetry, or joined in singing and religious worship. They were given new vision, not only religious but educational and cultural as well. “Miss Farnsworth” became not only the teacher, religious advisor, cultural stimulator, but also the counselor, nurse, and even the midwife on a few occasions. There were fewer school “drop-outs” and several students went on to graduate from eighth grade and she was able to assist them in getting registered later at the Murdock Academy at Beaver to begin their higher educations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle’s three winters at Sevier were interspersed with two terms of summer school at the U. of U.; for as she stimulated others to reach higher she increased her own resolve to do so. At the close of her last winter’s teaching at Sevier, <span id="page-573"></span> in order to have her credentials more complete, she herself went back to the Murdock Academy, which by then had become a four year high school, and in six weeks passed off her fourth year of high school training and received her high school diploma.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Myrtle left immediately for Chicago, Illinois, where she spent the rest of that summer at the University of Chicago specializing in food preparation, sewing, art, and the social treatment of crime. She visited art galleries, exhibits, museums, concerts and the beauty spots of nature, where she drank in the culture of that beautiful | city - such a contrast to the poverty of the little | old town of Sevier. This proved to be a glorious summer for her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She returned to Manti to teach Domestic Science, Domestic Art and English in the High School for a year. Then she went back to Beaver and taught the same subjects, plus Physiology, in the Murdock Academy for the next two years. She was persuaded to return to the Manti High School, where this time she commanded the highest salary of any teacher in that district. This was the fall of 1917. She taught there for the next three winters and then resigned her position to become the wife of the widower, Judge A. H. Christensen. Their marriage took place in the St. George Temple, 23 June 1920.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Albert was most fortunate to get such a woman as a second mother for his five children - and well he must have known it, for Myrtle brought not only expert training and unusual skill to the management of his household but great dedication and unselfish love as well. The children fondly called her “Aunt Myrtle” from the beginning and she accepted this with understanding and grace. She had a wonderful influence for good on the lives of these children over the ensuing years, as she of course did over the lives of her own three children who came to bless the home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Phillip tells something of this influence; — “Then came the day when I was about eight and a half years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the family. <span id="page-574"></span> I guess I was kind of a sickly looking little fellow then because she certainly took me in hand. I was finicky about what I ate and especially hated eggs. But there were things I ‘adored’ and those were Aunt Myrtle’s creampuffs with that good filling inside and chocolate on top. She put me under orders, however, that until I ate my eggs and other food I couldn’t have any creampuffs and she certainly did enforce those rules, much to my good. Though I had never eaten eggs if I could get out of it, she fixed them for me special by breaking them into a glass then putting the glass into a pan of boiling water until the eggs cooked up and were really delicious.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Through the years this dear woman saw to it that I was given good, nourishing food and I give her credit for pulling me out of the doldrums. Now, as I look back, I can see how silly I was in the things I liked to eat, but the training from Aunt Myrtle must have borne good fruits because my wonderful wife, Gwen, says I will now eat anything and refers to me in an endearing way as her ‘disposal’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I recall the day when I was about to leave our home in Orem for Salt Lake City where I was to take a bus to Washington, D. C. to join the F.B.I. and really go out into the great big world on my very own. I had my things packed, had taken a picture of Mt. Timpanogos, and was lying on the couch asleep, or nearly so. I recall Aunt Myrtle coming and bending over me, apparently asleep there on the couch, and in her sweet way kissing me and saying fervently ‘God bless you’. I say God bless you Aunt Myrtle for all you have done for me over these many years!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the family grew in number Myrtle had a way of drawing the shy new son-in-law into the inner family circle by giving him a chair to repair or a light switch to mend. She had the new daughter-in-law accompany her on shopping trips and consulted her on the selection of new outfits. She won the new grandchild over by letting her help roll and cut out cookies, by swinging her on the old bed springs swing south of the house, or by taking her onto her own comfortable lap and rocking her in the big rocking chair - all the time <span id="page-575"></span> singing lullabies in her deep, rich contralto, until she had put both herself and the little one to sleep.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle did much community service both before and after her marriage. Her war work during World War I and her humane efforts nursing the sick during the great flu epidemic which both accompanied and followed it, were worthy of note as was her service during World War II making parachutes and doing other war sewing. She was a member of the “Hopeless Club” in Manti for years and was an active participant in the Utah Sorosis Club of Provo for fifteen years while living in Orem, where her literary knowledge was used to benefit many. She worked long hard hours helping to get the Scera Center in Orem started. She did a lot in Four H Club work for young girls. She was active in P.T. A. work in various communities and served as president of the Orem organization for some time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aside from her service to her large and active family, however, her service to the Church was perhaps the most rewarding. This she never neglected. Besides teaching in the Sunday Schools some forty-five years or more, she taught numbers of years in the M.I.A. and served as president of the Young Ladies in Beaver Ward and then counselor in the Stake organization. She also served as Ward President of the Y.L.M.I.A. one year in Orem. She was president of the ward Primary there for seven years. She served on the Stake Board of the Relief Society while living in Orem and was class leader in all departments of the society on a Ward level at one time or another during the years. She spent part of the last two winters preceding her husband’s death working for the dead in the St. George Temple. In fact, it was only a week or so after the two returned from laboring there that Albert passed away (13 Mar. 1957).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With Albert’s passing, a wonderful companionship of nearly thirty-seven years was ended, as far as this earthly life was concerned. Though those years were tempered by both joy and sorrow, yet on the whole they had held far more of joy than of sorrow. Albert left Myrtle comfortably situated <span id="page-576"></span> and her health was good. She had had comparatively few sick days in her lifetime and was still able to take good care of herself. Nevertheless, she decided to sell her home in Orem and go and live with one or the other of her daughters, Norma and Kathryn, in places such as Washington, D, C., Bloomington, Indiana, Palo Alto, California, and in Salt Lake City, whither time took them. She knew she could still be of service to them and their young families and she desired this. Now, at age past eighty-three, she resides with Norma (Webster) and her Bishop husband and family in Salt Lake City, where she is still pretty much able to take care of herself at this writing. Only Norma and Kathryn can tell of the magnanimity of her services to them and theirs over the past twelve years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myrtle still has that sweet modesty that evidences faith in the ability of others and a willingness to allow them full credit, and more. In her exceptional memory she cannot tear herself apart from those with whom she has mingled - her life’s story seems to be mirrored in the lives and accomplishments of others. Her appreciation for the actions and kindnesses of others is never failing. “Thank you for a wonderful day”, a brief statement given in low vibrant tones from the heart, is so typical of this most gracious lady, the last remaining member of her generation of Christensens.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps nothing can better show the closeness of this family’s alliance or the deep respect of each member of it for “Aunt Myrtle” than the words of a letter written to her by Sherman just a month before the death of father, in recognition of her nomination as a candidate for the honor of Mother of the Year for the State of Utah. (She was awarded the place of “first alternate” to the woman chosen not long after father’s death.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">12 February 1957 “Dear Aunt Myrtle:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have just learned that you have been nominated for consideration as “Mother of the Year.” Feelings such as those I feel now ordinarily remain locked in the heart until occasions like this make</p>

Of course, after a fashion, we communicate them from day to day, but in such a subtle way that only the ones directly involved know fully what is meant.

  <p class="calibre1">“But now, I find that others have been more articulate in first applying to you the honored title of ‘Mother of the Year’. I wholeheartedly concur, and hasten to add this expression of my congratulations, admiration and love. Yet I cannot think of you in terms of but a single year, for you have been to us, indeed, ‘Mother of the Years’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My mind turns back to that day almost forty years ago, when the loss of my own mother was still vivid and cruel and I rode with you by train to Manti from Salt Lake City where I had been staying with Aunt Retta during the preceding school year. Sometime later you and Dad were married, I have seen you make three different houses into homes since then, keep up with the finer things of life in art, music and literature, and inspire all of us to do so, keep aware of the problems of neighbors and the world and help to solve both, and raise not only another woman’s children but your own also, all together as a family unit, graciously, efficiently and lovingly, without division and without distinction. And though we and ours are now scattered across the country and beyond, our thoughts are turned constantly to home, which remains simply where you and Dad are.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“May God bless you, not only for what you now are to us — The Mother of the Year — but for what you have been to all of us over the years gone by.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Affectionately, Sherman.”</p>
