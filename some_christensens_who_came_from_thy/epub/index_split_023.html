  <h2 id="the-united-order-experiment" class="calibre9">THE UNITED ORDER EXPERIMENT</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">In Gunnison the United Order was organized April 3, 1874. Advice, rules and regulations printed in circular form were sent out by the church presidency and apostles. The Order was reorganized in September and incorporated according  to law. About 300 persons, men, women and children in Gunnison, mutually agreed to honestly and diligently labor for the building up of the Kingdom  of God and for the salvation of mankind. “Their object was to create a higher standard of living, lessen women’s labor, better educate the youth, adopt the best methods of farming agreeable to location and circumstances, produce as economically  as possible and assist and divide with each other until all had plenty of this world’s goods.” Committees were appointed for farming, herding, butchering, merchandising, building, lumbering, salt boiling, wood hauling, railroad grading, and shoe, boot and harness making. Provisions were made for education, music and  singing. There was a special ways-and-means committee and one for streets and ditches. Winter work was threshing grain, logging, lime burning, rock quarrying and freighting, along with other pursuits of home industry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lars Myrup and his family joined the United Order in Gunnison and were numbered among the members there who consecrated their property,  time and means for the benefit of all concerned. Evidently Christen and Laurs Christensen and <span id="page-252"></span> their families were not among this group who organized there in September 1874. Whether they were slow in making up their minds or had some other reason we do not know. However, by the end of the year, their problems were apparently resolved in favor of “The Order” and they were ready to join forces with that noble  experiment — but not in Gunnison, for they had decided to move elsewhere. Thus, after five years of pioneering  in Gunnison, Laurs and Else with their four small sons, together with Christen, Anne, their three daughters and their three sons, pulled up their roots and moved again.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">As we know, the first inhabitants of Utah were the so-called “Children of Pride”, the dark skinned people belonging to the mighty Ute Indian or “Eutaw” nation, from which this state received its name. The Ute nation was divided into numbers of powerful tribes, each headed by a chief and assigned a designated territory or hunting ground over which it presided. Tribes were often divided into various Indian bands headed by sub-chieftains. These Utes were athletic, hardy, impudent and haughty, exhibiting in their makeup some of the best and some of the worst traits of character known to man. Their uncanny skill and courage made them the best warriors in the west and between tribes there were always conflict and wars. It was traditional with them to love and hate with vigor and so when the whites got in their way they often took revenge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the pioneers first came to the valleys, “Yakarah”, anglicized to Walker, was Chief of the main Ute tribe in the Territory and one of many brothers, all said to be of noble birth. Two of these brothers were Chiefs Sanpitch and Arapeen. Chief Walker’s favorite domain in general was the Sevier River System, which included the extensive five county region through which that river flowed; but he traveled far and wide east and west, hunting buffalo on the Great Plains, stealing horses by the hundreds from ranches and Spanish Missions in California and New Mexico, as well as taking scalps and prisoners and engaging in slave trade <span id="page-253"></span> as he went along extending his power and dominion. His band of followers, numbering from 500 to 700 braves, were considered the aristocrats of the Ute Nation and known far and wide for their excellent horsemanship and their dexterity in handling firearms. The reputation of Walker himself excited a variety of opinions. It could not be agreed as to whether he was good or bad, though all pronounced him clever. A contemporary of Brigham Young and much influenced by him in the long run, Walker joined the Mormon Church in March 1850 and later was made an Elder. He eventually signed over much of his territory to the church. Though he and his braves fought and bled the settlers in 1853-1854 in what was called “The Walker War”, he repented, we might say, “on his death bed”. Plagued with blindness for three days before he died, Jan. 25, 1855, he pleaded with his followers to keep peace with the whites.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Walker’s brother, Chief Arapeen, had previously  laid claim to most of Sanpete Valley, from Thistle on the north to Salina on the south, but when Walker died, succeeded him as chief over all his territory. Arapeen (Siegnerouch) had a special spot in Sanpete Valley that he loved above all others and here he made his summer camp. This beautiful, secluded area, surrounded by hills and mountains, came to be known as Arapeen Valley. It was an ideal setting for an Indian village  and here Arapeen and his band came year after year in summer, just as his ancestors of many generations had done before him. Indian folklore and tradition claim this to have been a place of “ancient fortifications” — who knows?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zig-zagging westward through this valley, headed for its rendezvous with the Sanpitch River, ran Twelve Mile Creek, which the Indians knew as  Aw wan ah voo. On the brink of a hill to the south, overlooking the creek bottom, Arapeen pitched his wickiup, below which his people cultivated and made an “Indian Farm”. Here, fed by mountain and canyon streams, the land provided much to sustain them besides farm products — fruit, fish and game. These Indians jerked meat to preserve it, and tanned skins of animals with a high degree <span id="page-254"></span> of excellence, from which they made their wigwams and clothing. Arapeen was as devoted to his people as Chief Walker had been to his and had their welfare  at heart; thus often bitterly resenting the encroachment of the whites on the streams and lands of their fathers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Arapeen was sometimes very friendly and looked to the whites for help and welcomed their assistance. We find him in such a mood soon after he took over Walker’s chiefship. In May, 1855, he appeared at Manti and said he believed there was room for all people in the area, both Indians and whites. Feeling that he was the rightful owner, as Chief of the Utes, of all the land of the region, he deeded Sanpete County and its water, timber and other assets, to Brigham Young as trustee-in-trust for the Mormon Church, — “for and in consideration of the good will I have to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints…” The original and complete copy of this deed, signed by Arapeen (Siegnerouch) with an “X”, and witnessed by George Snow (a son of Gen. Snow), R, William Glen and John Patten, can be found today at the Manti City courthouse. Notwithstanding, Arapeen still claimed ownership at times of different places in Sanpete, such as Warm Spring and the grassy meadow near the site of Fayette, which he bartered off to the first Bartholomews and Mellors who came there to settle. They gave him two fat oxen for the spring and some calves for the meadow, or so we are told.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In a warm-hearted effort to cement peace with the red brethren, Brigham Young, as Superintendent  of Indian Affairs as well as President in Utah, set aside various parcels of lands as “Indian Reservations”, where they could hunt and fish and also cultivate and improve farming land to provide them a better living. One of the most prosperous of these reservations was a twelve mile square area established around and including the well watered and timbered Arapeen Valley. A number of young men from Manti, including Moroni Voorhees,  a brother-in-law of Gen. Snow, were sent to live with the Indians on Twelve Mile. Here they learned the Indian language, helped build <span id="page-255"></span> fences and bridges and taught Arapeen’s people “white man’s ways” with the land. One hundred and ninety-five acres of land was under cultivation at the Indian Farm there in 1858, which produced about twelve hundred bushels of wheat besides corn and potatoes that year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chief Arapeen died of smallpox on the mountains  between Sevier and Grass Valleys, as he was returning from a good-will trip to the Navajo country,  and not long afterwards the Indian Black Hawk took over as the main Chief of the Utes in his area. It was only a few years after that the Indians were at war with the whites again, and as we should recall, this so-called Black Hawk War was somewhat  triggered by the bad temper of former Chief Arapeen’s son, Jake Arapeen. After the Black Hawk War began, in the spring of 1865, the Indians never came back to live in Arapeen Valley, though some came back often enough to steal and kill. During the war the deserted Indian village and farm on Twelve Mile became a military camp and a number of different cavalry and scouting companies  were stationed there off and on for three summers, under the overall supervision of General Daniel H. Wells. After hostilities were considered over, the settlers once again began visiting Arapeen Valley.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the month of May 1870 Simon Hansen, Mads Peter Sorenson and Carl Olsen drove their ox teams from Gunnison to Twelve Mile canyon to cut timber for homes and fences. They took the dirt road on the north side of Sanpitch River going southeast and crossed over below Chalk Hill, then followed along the east side of the river to Twelve Mile crossing (Christenburg) up past the “red hills” around the lake to Arapeen Valley. Lush Spring-fed  meadows lay to the north. The canyon stream cut a well-willowed path through the wide creek  bottom. As they pulled up onto the south side of the bench above the bottoms, a magic circle of earth and sky, bordered by a panorama of hills and mountains, surrounded them. To the east was Musinia (Mary’s Nipple) and the Wasatch Plateau, to the south the Glenwood mountain, to the west, above and beyond the low hills, <span id="page-256"></span> Mt. Carharine and the Pahvants, and to the north the Sanpitch mountains, visible as far as Thistle Valley. Beneath their feet the fertile brush covered soil was dotted with spring flowers. White, yellow-flecked sego lilies, red Indian paintbrush,  blue flax, pink sweet williams, lavender sweetpeas, pastel sugarballs, and vivid blossoms of the prickly pear and many unnamed blooms of golden hue vied for attention. This indeed looked like the “land of promise” to these young men in their prime and they picked out their homestead sites on the north side of the creek, for the land had just been opened up for homesteading by the national government. When they returned enthused to Gunnison and talked about the land, others were impressed and planned to join them. When they mentioned their intentions to move to Bishop Horne and asked if he had any objections, he said he had no real ones but hated to see them go for there was much to be done in Gunnison.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The spring of 1871 the three men and ten others formed a co-op and began farming at Twelve Mile. They cut the meadow hay with scythes and divided it equally. The next year they began digging a canal and cut a ditch to bring water from the creek to bring irrigation water to their land on the north and west. Bounteous crops, hand weeded, were harvested that fall and before winter had set in some temporary log cabins were started. But they had trouble off and on with the Indians, who managed to steal their horses when they were turned out to graze unguarded on the hills. Soon they knew enough to tie them up to their wagons at nights. A Conference was being held in Gunnison just before the middle of June 1872, and being eager to attend, the men left 15-year old Niels Heiselt to watch their horses. When they returned next day they found Niels dead, shot by Indians as he sat by the wagon eating his supper, and their horses gone. This shooting occurred 14 June.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the early spring of 1873 the three men, Hansen, Sorenson and Olsen, brought their wives and small children to Arapeen to live. They were soon joined by other families. The ditch was extended on the north division and more land was <span id="page-257"></span> broken up to meet the needs of the growing settlement. On the bend of the creek the trees, shrubs and turf were cleared of dead branches and in the delightful nook a bowery was built. Meetings and socials were held there and picnics and games were enjoyed in the shade of the tall cottonwoods. The “old swimming hole”, screened by squaw berries and birch, provided pleasure on hot summer  days, and here the family water barrels, mounted on two-wheeled carts in summer and bobsleds in winter, were filled as needed from the creek.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the next few years, beginning on September  14, 1874, most of the families living there on the north side mutually agreed to live by the rules of the United Order, to reverence Deity, pray with families and in secret, keep the Word of Wisdom… treat families with kindness and affection, set an example worthy of imitation, observe personal cleanliness, observe moral cleanliness in speech and action, keep the Sabbath day holy… to not appropriate for use that which belonged to others, return all that is borrowed… cancel indebtedness as soon as possible, patronize the Order and combine labor for mutual benefit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the U. O. Articles of Association were recorded at the Sanpete County Courthouse in Manti that mid-September day, it was necessary to select a name for the new settlement. Harking back to the beauty of the place during the month of May they called it Mayfield. The Articles also  insured “a twenty-five year contract for mining,  manufacturing, commercial and other industrial pursuits — building wagon roads, irrigation  ditches, colonizing and improvement of lands, establishing and maintaining schools, churches, libraries and any other benevolent, charitable or scientific associations consistent with the Constitution  of the United States and the laws of the… Territory.” Officers were to consist of a president,  vice-president, secretary and treasurer, appraisers and directors. Each monthly meeting of the membership was to be conducted by a chairman  selected from those present. <span id="page-258"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The United Order in general had been set up as a reform movement within the Church and inaugurated by President Brigham Young. He preached about it at General Conference and at all the settlements through which he traveled. The qualification for membership was not the amount of property possessed by the individual, but his standing in the Church and general good conduct. No one was admitted except those who put all they had into the association. The question of capacity to render valuable service to the group was not considered; the Gospel theory and practice of “the strong aiding the weak” was recognized and carried out, that the whole community might rise together. In most places the initiations of the “Order” were accomplished by a renewal of the covenant of baptism;  Brigham Young and his counselors setting the example at Ephraim, Utah July 17, 1875. The original “Law of Consecration” as introduced in Missouri by Joseph Smith the Prophet in 1831-34, was not strictly followed in any instance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Sevier Stake, of which Gunnison and Mayfield  were than a part, the organization of the Order came nearest to the original and proved the most successful. First set up there right after April conference in 1874 under the direction of Brigham Young’s oldest son, Joseph A. Young, who presided over that Stake, it grew in popularity until eight settlements in the Stake were involved and two-thirds  of the membership steadily working in it. Most kinds of work was done by contract, based on cash prices, and the surplus credits occurring from a man’s labor, over what he drew for the sustenance of himself and family, added to his stock in the organization. When a member wanted a house built and hadn’t quite enough stock or credit to pay for it, the Order built it for him and when his credits increased he paid the balance back. Besides the general stock, the members had “stewardships” which were separate and which included their homes, city lots, domestic animals, etc., which by industry and tact they could put to good use in procuring extras, the substantials being furnished from the Order’s source of supply. Thus the system was considered one of the best mutual associations in existence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-259"></span> In Else K. Christensen’s journal she wrote:  — “We were baptized into the United Order in 1875.”<sup id="fnref:3" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:3">3</a></sup> It must have been the very first part of 1875 however,  that our two Christensen families from Gunnison moved to the settlement in North Mayfield  and joined the Order there, for in the minutes of that Association for January 1875 we  read — “Resolved that we employ Elsie (Mrs. Lauritz) Christensen and Marie C. Erickson to superintend the milking of the cows in the company herd, and divide the milk according to the members of each family … etc.” The minutes for February 1875 included the following: — “A township, 640 acres, is being located on the south side of Twelve Mile Creek… Resolved to ask President Joseph A. Young to counsel us in regard to moving our improvements to this location (they did not move) … Considered letters from those asking for membership in the Order… It was decided to  trade some horses for cattle… Resolved to buy a Wood’s Self-rake reaper”. These are typical U. O. minutes, the originals are now in possession of a Mr. Hansen of North Mayfield, a grandson of Peter H. Hansen, then secretary of the organization.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A photo of this biographical note, with translation, can be found under Memories on Else K.‘s FamilySearch page (“Autobiographical details”).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most of those early North Mayfield homes were built of logs. The Christensens’ first homes there may have been temporary willow-covered extensions to their wagon boxes until log cabins could be built for them. But the families must have been safely settled before long that mid-winter in acceptable, though modest, quarters, since all were to share alike in the Order, at least as far as the essentials were concerned. They had brought all they owned with them, which must have been little enough, and consecrated it to the Order, having disposed of what they could not bring. On the other hand the spiritual gifts they brought along must have been great, for they were people of strong faith and deep humility in the main.  Their spiritual blessing must have been increased many-fold there, especially for those of them who sincerely sought to consecrate their very lives, as well, in an all-out effort to keep the divine laws.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Mayfield Order land was divided into fifteen acre pieces, considered then to be worth <span id="page-260"></span> between 4 and 5 dollars per acre, with water enough to water it being brought in ditches from Twelve Mile Creek. Each man labored for himself after spending so much time for the Order. He was paid or credited in the organization for all time spent over and above that which was required. The amount of wages was decided by the directors, with most men receiving full time pay and a few not quite so much. Women were given three full days pay for every six worked, and children were also recompensed for their efforts. A fifteen year old boy received a house and lot in the Order. Sloth was considered a deadly sin. Oxen were used for farming purposes, as Brigham Young advised, because  they were about 50% less expensive to keep than horses. (It was estimated at the time that it took 200 bu. of oats per span of horses yearly and $6.00 to keep them shod.) Oxen were also considered  better than horses for working in the timber. The skins on their legs were tougher, they were less excitable in precarious situations common to the logging business and they handled better on long trips up and down the canyon or over the steep rough terrain of the timber country.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else’s longing for a girl baby was satisfied two-fold when on Monday 8 Mar. 1875 twin girls came to bless the Christensens in their small log cabin home in North Mayfield. The babies were frail and Laurs called in W. N. Tofte to assist him in giving them names and blessings right away. Brother Tofte named the first one, Elsie Kathrine, for her mother and she lived. Laurs named the second Mary Karen, in memory of his mother, but she died that same day. They always called her “Karrie” when they spoke of her afterwards. Laurs undoubtedly fashioned a small casket of wood, which they lined with softest homespun, and laying the wee corpse gently inside, buried it in the freshly dug earth behind their cabin. Anne was probably called to assist with the other little girl and with Else, while Laurs looked after the four boys as best he could. And though they grieved for small Karrie and what might have been, yet they must have been comforted in the belief that she had gone to join the gentle Karen in Paradise. <span id="page-261"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">That spring some twenty-one families moved from the northern town of Ephraim and settled on the new townsite south of Twelve Mile Creek. This place was at first jokingly called “New London” for one of the English-born women in the group but was actually South Mayfield. The families here did not belong to the Order, but living conditions in the two settlements were much the same. The homes at first were mostly small log cabins with rough lumber shanties in the rear, later used for granaries. In addition to caring for her family and helping with the hard work of building new settlements from scratch, each pioneer mother there waged a constant war on the lizards, snakes and rodents that would share her dwelling in spite of all she could do. South Mayfield grew rapidly and though there was much competition between the two settlements, they also cooperated in building mills, roads, ditches and other mutually helpful improvements, as well as buying large machinery together for the benefit of both. It is said those on the south side called those on the north “the Orderites”, while those on the north called the south folks “the Skinnykites”. When one left to cross over the Indian Farm and Twelve Mile Creek from one part of Mayfield to the other he likely would be heard to say, “I’m going over to the other side”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About the first of July that year the proud old Dane, Christen Christensen, had endured about all he could take of “the Order”. So he pulled out and took his family back to Gunnison. He had put all he owned into that experiment, which had been little enough - a few horses, cows, pigs, chickens, a wagon and perhaps some small machinery - not many who joined had more to give. But he took much less than that out, the sum total of nothing except his family’s personal belongings - not even one cow to furnish milk for his children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lars Myrup furnished them with an adobe  dwelling not far from his own in East Gunnison and most likely with sustenance as well, until Christen could get to producing again. It was a blow to the older man’s pride to have to depend entirely on others, even for milk for his family; <span id="page-262"></span> he having been so long successful and independent and one to whom others looked for aid. A story is told of Christen at that time by his granddaughter, Florence C, Hougaard:— “One morning the family was seated at breakfast when they heard the mooing of a cow close by. They had no cow - so they went outside to see. Behold it was one of their own cows they had been forced to leave behind in “the Order”. Old Bossy had followed them back to Gunnison. They were overjoyed and Christen locked her up in their corral right away. Speaking of it later the old Dane said, “I don’t know for sure if I did right or not - but I felt the hand of the Lord was in it!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though some left the “Order” from time to time, others moved in. If Laurs had been tempted to pull out at the end of six months, when his father did, something restrained him. Perhaps it was the courageous, determined Else. Needless to say, they stayed on there and continued to labor hard to provide for their growing family as well as to contribute their share and more in building the organization. Homes were plastered on the inside with sand and lime. Ceilings were made of cheap factory and were whitewashed along with the walls, either with lime or with chalk from Chalk Hill. Men made their furniture or obtained it from the Order, whose carpenters were always busy. Tables, benches, chests, shelves, cradles and beds were made from logs hauled from the mountains  and milled at the lumber mill. Bedsprings were made mostly from rope. Mattresses were straw ticks or feather beds. Home spun blankets and quilts made from worn clothing kept the family warm, Pine and cedar from the surrounding mountains  kept the wood-burning stoves fed. Wool from the sheep was used for making blankets and clothing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So life went on, and in the Order much that went on was mapped out in the various monthly meetings of the association, from whose minutes we again quote: July 1875,“Met in the Bowery. P. C. Christensen appointed to keep order in the company yards and corrals… Resolved to instruct those who attend the chickens to prepare the eggs for shipment (by freight wagon)… Building committee appointed… Resolved to <span id="page-263"></span> buy notions and things that might be needed by the women… Petition presented for each family to keep a pig and chickens. Petition granted.” October 1875: “Agreed to ask some of the families to vacate the houses belonging to the company as they will be needed for grain bins.” December 1875: “Resolved that we declare a dividend of 10% per annum and credit same as Capital Stock… New directors elected viva voce.” February 1876: “Proposition presented to build for Peter H. Hansen a 14 x 12 ft. house with a kitchen at back, with both lath and plastering for walls and ceiling in front room, on condition he is willing to give up his present house for a meeting-house and his lot for a jubilee lot — proposition accepted.” December 1876: “A call has been made for donations  for the temple to be erected at Manti. Resolved to donate both labor and available means… It was determined what credit each stockholder should receive for his work and the work done by his wife and children (a man received ⅓, ½, ⅔, or full wages, according to the work accomplished) … wives who shear sheep shall receive one day’s pay for 20 head… ½ regular pay for girls planting potatoes.” January 1877: “Resolved to put floors in the houses, one room in each house first… Resolved that we subscribe for two copies of the Deseret News semi-weekly … etc… etc…” There was so much planning  to do in the Order that monthly business meetings sometimes lasted from early evenings until 3 o’clock in the mornings.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Brigham Young was a great colonizer, an  inspired leader and an outstanding personality; in truth he was one of the world’s great benefactors and is so considered by many today. A few of the untold number of helps instigated by him for the benefit of his people were the Immigration Fund, lasting peace with the redmen, railroad building, the United Order, and University and Temple building. The Church grew and flourished under his leadership, as he went from city to city and settlement to settlement meeting with and instructing  the Saints. The last few years of his life there <span id="page-264"></span> were a number of things took place that particularly affected the people of central Utah and Sanpete County. Besides the final settlement of the Black Hawk War in 1872 and the establishment of the United Order 1874-75, there was the completion of the Southern railroad to near the north border of Sanpete, as far as York, Juab Co, 18 Feb. 1875; the founding of the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, Utah Co., 16 Oct. 1876; and the breaking of ground for the temple at Manti, April 25, 1877. Numerous Stakes and Wards all over the church were reorganized and new ones formed in 1877 under his direction. Mayfield was made a Ward and taken from Sevier Stake into the newly formed Sanpete Stake, 4 July 1877, both the north and south sides being included in the new Ward.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The last minutes of the United Order in Mayfield  to which we have had access are the following: January 20, 1877. “Special meeting called… the President laid before the stockholders the following: If they would be in favor of selling our farms and remove as a company to Arizona… Resolved to let the question rest until we get more information in regard to it… Minutes read and accepted, Benediction Hans N. Tuft. Adjourned sine die. Secretary Peter H. Hansen.” These may have been the last minutes kept by that organization  in North Mayfield, for it wasn’t long before the Order broke up there. Numbers drew out their stock, gave up their stewardships and moved, some to New London or South Mayfield and some elsewhere. Still some continued to live on in “the Order”, as North Mayfield was called, although the organization was abandoned as such, and some of the descendants of these still live there today. The United Order movement generally did not get a fair start. Several factors contributed to its early abandonment: first, membership in it was voluntary and numbers in each area were not willing or not considered worthy to enter the Order, thus two classes were created in the Church, which was undesirable; second, there was lack of uniformity  in the movement as well as the vigorous leadership which was withdrawn when the Prophet Brigham Young’s health began failing; third, the great influx of non-Mormons into the territory and <span id="page-265"></span> the increasing complexity of community life, which produced friction. By the time of Brigham Young’s death, 29 Aug. 1877, the majority of the Stakes and settlements had given up the United Order, including North Mayfield, but the Stakes and Wards of the church continued to grow and flourish and railroad, college and temple building went on.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else Christensen and their family were among those who went over to the other side. By some means, Laurs procured a lot on the south side of Mayfield, or in New London as it was then called. The property was located some east and south of the public square there. Whether he homesteaded it, or purchased it from the government,  we are unable to say. Nevertheless he became the first recorded private owner of that lot, for we saw an abstract of the deed. Though it was not recorded as belonging to him until Jan. 5th 1880 (when it was all paid for or other terms of the contract with the government had been fully complied with) we know he moved onto the property at least two-and-a-half years before that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A three-room adobe house, facing west, was soon built on the premises and before Sunday, 8 July 1877, the Christensen family had moved in. On that particular day Else gave birth to a fine black-haired baby girl. They selected the name Emma Eliza for this little one but it wasn’t until 4 Oct. 1877 that they took her to the church there and had her blessed. Bishop Ole C. Olsen of Mayfield Ward blessed and named her. On that particular day also, the baptisms of Christen and Andrew were taken care of by the Bishop’s counselor,  Henry Jensen, Christen had just passed his tenth birthday (Oct. 4) and Andrew was four months past eight. The baptisms were undoubtedly held in the waters of Twelve Mile Creek and it is a good guess that their mother Else was not present.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs also secured a small farm in the fields near town. His credit in the Order likely supplied him with little more than a wagon and team of oxen, a milch cow or two, perhaps a horse, along with a few tools and possibly a plough; his stewardship of cabin and lot, etc., having gone with the Order. <span id="page-266"></span> With the few chickens, pigs or sheep the family may have accumulated, plus their meager furniture, bedding and personal belongings, their total possessions  then must have been scant indeed. The son Albert, in his recollections which are included in “The Hard Rich Soil” had this to say on the subject: “After leaving the Order and settling in South Mayfield,  the family had to do without all of what were considered the luxuries, and at times some of the necessities of life. With a large and growing family it became a struggle to make ends meet.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs labored on his small farm to raise what he could. He planted, and looked at the sky for signs of rain, for there were dry years when water was scarce as well as wet years when the floods came. There were years when the snows came early, before the crops were ready to harvest, and there were years when summer came late and planting was delayed or when early crops were nipped by frost. Laurs worked at other things too - herding sheep, hauling logs and timber, railroading,  ditch digging, road grading, freighting, odd jobs - anything he could do to bring in a little extra pay in produce, script or cash - but cash was scarce. Sometimes he worked on shares. His skin was tanned and weather-beaten as he labored in all kinds of outdoor weather to provide for his family. He worked for the benefit of the Church as well, dedicating time and effort in lieu of money, getting out timber from Twelve Mile Canyon for the building of the Manti temple, building  roads over which the timber could be brought, or any other thing that his toil could supply for the raising of that holy structure. Temple building in Zion was a cooperative undertaking and all good Saints were loyal to the cause. Working for the Lord and one’s self and family was a joy. It wasn’t work that wore a man down - but the worry and fear of failing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else did her share. She was vigorous, capable  and determined, for she had many dreams for her children. She, with others of the pioneer women there, sheared the sheep, carded the wool, spun the thread and wove and dyed the cloth. With her wool-cards, spinning wheel, knitting needles <span id="page-267"></span> and loom, she made and sewed by hand most of the clothing worn by her family, as well as her own. Dyes found in berries, brush, bark and dogwood  could add a variety of color to the handmade articles so, together with her young children, she went into the field and hills gathering rabbit brush for yellow and bark and berries for a variety of browns and reds. She made rugs to cover her floor from rags or wornout clothing, torn into narrow strips then sewed together and woven on a loom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When she needed soap to help keep the family and the home clean, she saved wood ashes in a large barrel, poured water over them and caught the drippings, added these to scraps of fat she had hoarded and boiled them up together. Then after much stirring and many skimmings over the hot fire, she set the mixture by to cool and harden, to be cut up into bars of soap afterwards. Water with which to clean and wash, as well as drink and cook, had to be carried mostly from the irrigation ditch that ran near by. (They caught soft water in rain barrels under the eaves.) Washing of clothes was done by hand with homemade soap and plenty of hard scrubbing on the washboard. The ironing was done with stove irons, with a special fluting iron for ruffles on skirts and bonnets. Their clothing differed greatly from our present day scanties; for though boys’ summer clothes might have come under that category to some extent, female clothing in particular bore very little  resemblance to that of the present. Long full skirts, dragging the ground, tight long mutton sleeved waists, warm-shawls, petite bonnets tied under the chin, and high button shoes were high style for women in those days - but not all could afford to be in fashion. Clothes had to last a long time and be durable as well as fashionable.  Hand-me-downs and made-overs were much in style also in early Mayfield and Gunnison days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The boys of the Christensen family had much worth remembering in those South Mayfield days, for though poor in worldly goods perhaps, they were rich in the association of “caring parents” and each other and the developing experiences of <span id="page-268"></span> childhood. Again we draw from the rememberings of Albert: — “In our home in those years we had family prayer mornings and evenings. Our mother was a great person. She seemed to be able to tell our thoughts. She always knew just what to do if we got sick or hurt and somehow she didn’t seem like other women … Our father was the most patient and kindest of fathers and never throughout his lifetime touched a child of his in anger. A happy childhood home and the memories of that home are worthwhile companions for a young boy… Our home was always a place of love and peace. Contention or quarreling was uncommon.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One of my early recollections concerns a momentous event in the life of any boy in this western country. Father bought us a pony. It was an experience of ownership in common. Many delightful hours were spent in riding this most precious possession in the world. In the beginning, the great thrill was riding behind one of my older brothers, it being deemed unsafe for me to ride alone. This limitation at least at first was accepted without protest. To feel the exhilaration of a gallop up the road into the mouth of Twelve Mile Canyon, to see the willows and trees passing behind us as we surged ahead over the lively feet of this wonderful  horse, was a great thrill.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Black Hawk War was over before my time (the year of his birth actually), but it was very much in the minds of all of us. Tales of the Indian depredations often were the entertainment of both children and adults. Frequently the older children would ‘play Indian’. Sometimes I had troubled dreams. One evening about sundown I was out in the yard with some other boys. Some Indian stories were being rehearsed by one of the older boys. While I was between the house and the boys one of them yelled, “There they come!” I was immediately stricken with the most violent fear and ran into the house screaming and sobbing. Despite the reassurance of my mother as she held me on her lap, I could not be calmed. For years afterwards in the dark, especially in the mountains, I frequently had to overcome the same feeling.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One day later on I was ‘riding double’ behind <span id="page-269"></span> my brother. It was a beautiful day in early summer  when the air was balmy and laden with the smell of pinon pine, cedar and flowers along the way. But the joy of riding soon vanished. Immediately  ahead there came toward us a band of Indians, swinging their blankets and ‘whooping it up’ in regular Indian style. We turned the pony and sped towards home. I clung to my brother in terrible fright. Soon the Indians were upon us. Further efforts to escape were useless. We slowed our pace and, numb with fear, awaited what it seemed would be an inevitable doom. To our great surprise the Indians passed by and as they did so one of their number said in a rather pleasant voice, ‘Hello bub, did you get scared?’ After recovering from the excitement I found that one shoe of my only pair had been lost. Notwithstanding  its great value, we had no immediate desire to go back to find it. Later efforts to locate the shoe failed. For the rest of the summer I went barefoot, which was the custom in Mayfield among the children generally. The lack of shoes did not deter us from freely roaming through the fields and along the foothills.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When I was a little older, Indians became more familiar. Considerable numbers camped a short distance south of the village. Often in the groups of Indians were boys of my own age - 6 or 7 years old. From time to time, with other boys, I visited the camp and engaged in playing, and at times wrestling, with Indian boys my size. The grown-up Indians took great delight in the sport, especially when an Indian boy would throw one of us. At such times they would yell and applaud, but would become silent and detached when an Indian boy was thrown. (After Mayfield was settled, Indians often came, spending a week or two in town gathering food such as flour, pork and eggs. They often brought dried venison to trade.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Later when I could ride alone I learned that a boy makes a poor hitching post. My father and some of the older boys were working on a 15-acre farm about a mile east of Mayfield. They were ploughing with old Tom and Jerry, a yoke of oxen. I rode the pony up to the farm. As the sun warmed <span id="page-270"></span> the earth and air, I got sleepy. I decided to take a nap on the warm land. I tied the rope that held the pony around my waist to make sure he would stay with me. However, my peaceful slumbers were abruptly ended as I found myself sailing over the ploughed ground at the end of the rope, with the pony running hard and as frightened as I. The chase ended without serious consequences. I do not remember what, if anything, my father said to me about the matter. Knowing his life-habit of never volunteering needless advice, I am sure he said little or nothing. He probably knew that the experience had made sufficient impression.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One fine day in late summer or early autumn, the four of us brothers, Chris, Andrew, Joseph and I, who often roamed the foothills and fields together, were roaming the fields and accidentally  ran across a watermelon patch. The sun was warm and the field was dry as far as water was concerned. The temptation was strong to satisfy our thirst with a fine watermelon, which we did. We were sitting there so engaged when Jim Whitlock rode by and saw us eating the watermelon. He evidently knew whose patch it was as he promptly notified our mother that we were raiding the Bishop’s watermelon patch. When we came home in the afternoon we were confronted with the charge of stealing the Bishop’s watermelons  (Bishop Ole C. Olsen). Our mother was a firm believer in not letting wrongs remain long unsettled, so as might have been expected under the circumstances, she told us we must go down to the Bishop’s place, about two blocks away, and ‘make it right with him.’ A vigorous demurrer was interposed against this, but we were very firmly told not to expect anything to eat until we had made it right with the Bishop. None of us was hungry, and at the time it seemed to matter very little whether we got any dinner or not. (We were still full of watermelon!) But we soon learned that melon fullness does not last long. We went about our play, but when the sun was beginning to reach the west hills we thought about our supper. Knowing that mother meant what she said, we called a council of war. It was unanimously decided to go and see the Bishop. <span id="page-271"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We started down across the public square, then covered with sagebrush, proceeding in Indian style, Chris leading the way, Andrew next, then Joseph, and I toddling along in the rear. I suppose I felt most secure as I was the last one in order to meet the wronged Bishop. However, we arrived at the log home of Hannah, second wife of the Bishop, Chris knocked rather lightly and, as we feared he would, the Bishop answered the door. We were invited in and he asked us what he could do for us. The truth was hesitantly told and we all joined in giving assurance that we didn’t know it was his patch, that we wouldn’t do it again and that we hoped he would forgive us. Breathlessly we awaited his response. We didn’t have long to wait for he exclaimed, ‘God bless you boys!’ And then he called, ‘Hannah, go down to the cellar and get these boys some melons.’ Hannah did so promptly, bringing up four large melons. The Bishop patted us on the heads and blessed us as though we were real heroes. We went home happy and really grateful to the Bishop and to our mother. We had our supper that night with a satisfied conscience,  but as I recall we ate no more watermelon that day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There was another experience that we enjoyed at serviceberry time. In the fall of the year when these berries were ripe, the women and children of the village went up into the hills east of Mayfield, where the bushes were numerous and generally loaded with fruit. This was the principal  fruit available there at that time. Usually, kettles and cans and all manner of other containers would be taken along. Sheets and canvas were spread on the ground. The branches from the bushes would be broken off or cut down, then shaken over the sheets and canvas. When the  containers were filled with berries, it would be a tired but happy group that would return to town. Generally, the winter supply of fruit was obtained from this source, supplemented by chokecherries, which were also plentiful in the hills and lower slopes of the mountains.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the summer of 1878 there came into my life an experience which impressed me with the <span id="page-272"></span> fact that we are not wholly alone, and that there are some things inexplicable about dreams. Through this and other experiences I have come to believe without doubt that warnings are sometimes  given to people through dreams. One morning at breakfast time mother told us that she had had a dream about me and the big irrigation ditch that ran past our home on the north, with a foot-bridge across it. She told us that she dreamed that she was standing on that bridge looking at the water in the ditch as it flowed rapidly westward and under the bridge. All of a sudden, upstream a little way, she saw my hat come floating. She hurridly stooped down from the bridge to pick it up and when she did so, there was my face under the hat. She said that she then awoke and was so worried about the dream that she couldn’t go back to sleep. She was afraid that something would happen to me if I didn’t stay away from the water. Of course, I promised that I would be careful. A few days afterwards mother told us that she had had another dream about the same as the first except that she was standing on the bridge across Twelve Mile Creek, which people crossed enroute to North Mayfield. As she was looking at the stream she saw my hat floating down toward the bridge about as she had seen it a few nights before. She rushed down to get the hat and as she picked it up, my face was under it. That morning she appeared more worried than ever and told us all, and especially me, not to go near the ‘creek’, as it was called… Very soon after the two dreams, mother told us of another dream which she had in which she was again on the bridge which spanned this same creek. She again saw my hat and under it my face, as she had seen it before in her dreams. We all promised to be careful around the water and not go near the creek. After a time however, as nothing unfavorable happened, the excitement about the dreams was more or less forgotten.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Before this it had been common for my brothers and me, with other boys, to go fishing on the creek with our string lines and pin hooks. The ‘Big White Hole’ was especially popular. Here the water entered the hole rapidly and the white foam would often cover its surface in different <span id="page-273"></span> sized patches as clouds occasionally cover the blue sky… One day, some time after the dreams, Jim Paulson, Jim Whitlock and my oldest brother Chris came to the place and it was there decided to go down to the creek for a swim. Chris was the oldest and I was the youngest of the four boys present at the time. It was Chris’ job generally to take care of me, so I toddled along with the other boys over the ‘Indian Farmland’. We ended up at the swimming hole. The three other boys were good swimmers. It didn’t take long for them to slip off their clothes - whether or not they had shoes on has escaped my memory; probably not. For some reason the three went upstream for seventy-five to a hundred yards to another hole. In the meantime, I decided to paddle around in the water but I had difficulty in getting my shirt off as it buttoned down the back; try as I could I couldn’t get it unbuttoned. It appeared that the button was larger than the buttonhole! I decided to go to Chris for help. As the bank of the creek was smoother on the north side, I determined to cross over. The water didn’t seem deep just above the swimming hole where the water flowed rapidly. About all I remembered was that I slipped and fell and in an instant was in deep water. Everything went black and then I had a faint feeling of floating in the air. The next thing I knew I was on the sand bank on the other side of the swimming hole with my brother and the other two boys. They were working my arms and legs and moving me around, It seemed a long time before I could walk. Then I learned what had happened. When the three had come back to the swimming hole they couldn’t see me and they called. Receiving no answer, they looked frantically about and finally saw my white hair in the middle of the whirlpool. Jim had leaped into the pool and dragged me out. As soon as I felt better I was carried over to where our clothes were. When we were dressed we proceeded toward home, Chris holding one of my arms and one of the other boys the other. As we walked along my strength returned and by the time we got home I was all right. We decided not to tell of this experience as we knew it would worry especially mother.” (And Chris, Albert and Jim Whitlock <span id="page-274"></span> never did. However, years later, during the construction  of the Denver and Rio Grande railroad through Utah, when the project was proceeding across the desert east of Price, Utah, Jim Paulson gave the long-kept secret away. He was working on the railroad there with Albert’s father, Laurs, and one evening around the campfire asked the older man what ever happened to his son Albert who was nearly drowned in Twelve Mile Creek. When Laurs showed great surprise, the whole story was divulged to him and later through him to Else.)</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Education in those early days in Utah was not compulsory. Citizens in each city, town or village handled the problem of educating their children in their own way. Education of their children, however,  was one of the first interests of most pioneer parents. With Else Christensen this was particularly  true, and she taught her own children herself at her knee until other schooling was available  and even afterwards. Her deep interest in the culture and training of the mind carried over into the lives of most of her sons and daughters. It wasn’t until the family joined the Order and moved to North Mayfield that Christian and Andrew started school. However, both had been so well taught by Else in the home that when they were ready for school they were in their “advanced readers”. Martha Hansen, wife of Simon, took the Order  children into her home and gave them their first school there. It wasn’t until after the United Order was abandoned that the teaching of children was held other than in private homes in Mayfield. Joseph must have started school first in New London (or South Mayfield) the fall of 1877, also in a private home, for it wasn’t until 1878 that a rock building 35 x 23 feet was erected there on the northwest corner of the public square for school, church and all public gatherings. Albert told of his first educational training outside the home thus:— “I started District school in Mayfield in the fall of 1878, when five years old. (He turned six in December.) My first teacher was Gus M. Clark and school was held in the meeting house.” <span id="page-275"></span> As far as we can determine this all-purpose rock building was one block west and one north from the Christensen home in South Mayfield. This settlement  had a school board of its own by then, which hired and paid the teachers. The first teachers were paid so much per pupil, often in produce or script, since cash was scarce. Later on, three one-room rock schools were maintained in Mayfield  with pupils of many ages and grades meeting together under a single teacher. One of these was in North Mayfield and two were on the south, where the younger grades were separated from the older ones. Long after the Christensens had left that settlement, the last of the nineteenth century, a consolidation of schools took place and a new public school building was planned to house children  from the beginners to the eighth grade. The spot selected for the resulting two-story brick school house was the historic site of Chief Arapeen’s  summer home and a favorite camping ground for his ancestors in days of long ago.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must have taken months before word came to Else of her father’s death. Anders Christian Christensen died in Nørhaa 10 May 1878 and was buried in the Parish churchyard there beside his wife Mette, 15 May 1878. Else’s sister Karen Skaarup later wrote her about it. As Else knew, her people believed with other Lutherans that if one died in full belief of the Trinity and had not denied the faith they would be saved. To her the gaining of a glorious salvation was not nearly so easy. She herself had given so much and suffered so much for the gospel’s sake to this point, and yet she must have felt much more would yet be required before she could hope for the best reward in Heaven. The status of her deceased parents in the next world must have troubled her, but the thought of her father’s passing must have brought heartache and memories flooding back to. her - memories of her childhood. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else and their children must have visited back and forth with relatives in  Gunnison - Christen and Anne, Lars Myrup and Maren, Pauline and Andrew Andersen, and Petrine and Sena, Petrine was now a beautiful girl nearing <span id="page-276"></span> twenty and keeping company with a fine young man by the name of Jens Mikkelsen. Christen and Anne had another son, born 10 Jan. 1877 whom they named Joseph. Lars Myrup and Maren, keeping pace, had a dainty little daughter born 4 June 1877, whom they named Karen Laurine. Pauline had gotten over her grief at losing two little sons, one after the other in the cradle as it were, when she gave birth to a lovely baby daughter on 13 June 1876. They had named her Annie Lenora, after Anne (the American spelling was Annie). The news in Gunnison that had them all talking, however, was Lars Myrup’s going into “polygamy” and taking two more wives besides Maren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Plural marriage was not a general law for the entire church and was never, at any time, practiced by over 2 percent of the eligible adult male population. Those who were permitted to  practice it officially were chosen for their unquestionable  integrity and good standing, and undoubtedly believed plural marriage to be a doctrine of divine origin. The majority of men and women who embraced it were among the most moral people the world has ever known. Through this social order the great surplus of female Saints in the church were given protection and absorbed into useful family life. That some of the finest people of the church and of the world came from such plural households is an undeniable fact. But despite all the social reasons that may be advanced in its favor, it must be admitted that it was directly contrary to the tradition of the people, both in and out of the church.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps no doctrine of the early church so caused dissention within or without the organization as did this so-called “polygamy”. It is a fact, sad to say, that a number within the church abused this law. From them and ever-malicious Mormon-haters,  rumors flew on the tongue of gossip and were multiplied and enlarged, causing abuse, ridicule and slander of the church and its people to such an extent and created such a stir among its enemies and the press, that the United States Congress was inveigled into passing a number of “anti-bigamy” laws, one after the other, the last <span id="page-277"></span> and most infamous being the “Edmunds Tucker Act.” With these laws the bitter anti-Mormons not only intended to crush the practice of polygamy but crush the church as well. How near they came to succeeding can only be touched on here. For some thirty years the bitter campaign of persecutions raged against the church and its people. At its height Utah, besides being denied statehood, was actually deprived of the rights of self-government. The property of the church was confiscated and it was even taxed outrageously for the use of its offices, buildings and temple block. During this period the church was under heavy financial stress and its credit so depleted it could not borrow a dollar. Only the faithful payment of tithes enabled it to weather the storm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Members of the church for a time were not allowed to vote or hold office. Federal officers were sent to govern the Territory; many if not most of them anti-Mormons who put every stumbling block they could in the way of the General Authorities and other church leaders who practiced plural marriage. Most of these were hunted down unmercifully, fined, imprisoned, or both, or forced into exile. Some took their families  and fled to Canada or Mexico, but most stayed and faced the music. Hundreds of homes were broken up, husbands and fathers sent to the penitentiary and even wives and mothers jailed for “contempt of court”. The Prophet Brigham | Young, who had many wives, was punished with the rest and had his health weakened and his life shortened due to the rigid treatment he was put under at that time. His successor in the church, President John Taylor, died in exile. It was not until his successor, President Wilford Woodruff, under divine inspiration, issued his famous “manifesto” declaring an end to plural marriage in this dispensation that the persecutions began to subside. It was a number of years after that, however, before there was peace again and church and personal property in the Territory was restored  to its rightful owners.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In this atmosphere our Danish progenitors lived and breathed, for though they themselves <span id="page-278"></span> never embraced polygamy (one wife at a time was enough for Christen and Laurs Christensen), yet many of their General, Stake and Ward leaders and their friends and associates did. For them they were concerned. Among these of course were Bishop Ole C. Olsen of Mayfield and their highly esteemed kinsman, Lars Myrup. Just how these and other of the polygamist brethren in Gunnison handled their particular problems in this regard, we know little. They and their families were undoubtedly “made to pay” in some way or another, since the wary federal authorities were like bloodhounds - fierce on the trail and never at rest when on the scent of an offender! Unexpected knocks on doors of polygamist homes during those trying times must have struck fear to the hearts of occupants, young and old. Searches, raids, arrests, trials and disenfranchisements  were numerous and grievous to bear. There was usually a hidden trapdoor to a cellar or attic through which the head of a household could be hustled at such times as it was breathlessly  announced, — “U. S, Deputy Marshals are in town!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aside from their run-ins with the law, these families often had internal problems because of this plurality of wives. Lois Myrup Anderson, a granddaughter of Lars and Maren, has given us a “peek” into the Lars C. N. Myrup home during this period:— “Maren agreed to his second marriage  to Josephine Marie Jensen, a very young Danish immigrant girl. My father (Niels Christian Myrup) remembered seeing this girl for the first time one evening when he and the other boys were in bed. She came into their home and threw herself  down on the floor in front of Maren and begged to be allowed to come and live with them. She was not quite sixteen years old at the time and hadn’t been in this country very long. Father said her family was very poor, Lars used to visit these new Danish immigrant families to help them get settled in this country, and Maren often went with him. (They had doubtless met Danish Marie on one of these visits.) Later Lars married this girl (17 Jan, 1876). It was not generally known that she and Lars were married for she worked <span id="page-279"></span> for Maren as a sort of a mother’s helper. She adored Maren and the feeling was mutual between them. When Maren died suddenly, Marie also died a few months later, people said ‘of a broken heart’. Lars married his third wife, another Danish girl named Mary Ann Jensen, in St. George, 15 Feb. 1877. When she moved in, the kind and gentle Maren was very much grieved when her young boys had to give up their bedroom and sleep in the granary.  Many times the wife Mary Ann put on men’s pants and went out to work in the fields if Lars was short-handed. Father said that after Maren’s death your grandmother, Else Christensen, came to their house many times to see how Maren’s children were getting along with their ‘hot- tempered’ stepmother.”</p>
