  <h2 class="calibre9" id="luther-bartholomew-christensen">Luther Bartholomew Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(41) Luther Bartholomew Christensen (2) His sister Edith writes: “When our youngest brother Luther arrived he was a beauty! But when a few weeks old he contracted pneumonia. Mother doctored him first with what she knew but began to despair of his life. They called the doctor. He reduced the living room heat, opened the windows wide and ordered the infant to be wrapped in cloths wrung from ice water. Mother proceeded with panic in her heart, ice water! But it worked! The fever dropped, the congestion vanished, the baby ate again and it was over - like a miracle!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Luther writes of his own life: “It was a cold, grey spring morning on 20 May 1911, in the little university town of Leipzig, Germany, when the doctor walked down the two flights of stairs to file my birth certificate. Soon afterwards my father was asked to leave the school, for ‘infractions’, a little rule against students preaching religion. They didn’t even give him time to organize a protest march or sit down strike. I am told that Father left first and that the family followed shortly, and I was carried, wheeled, shipped, railroaded and autoed from place to place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father was finally sent to Rexburg, Idaho to convert the school there from a high school to college standard. I had then reached the age of five and my first recollection is of lying on my belly on a foot bridge over an irrigation canal, dangling a pinned worm in front of a fat lazy trout that was holding himself motionless in the clear <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-844" title="844"></span>cold water flowing past his brilliant sides. I don’t remember if he took that worm, but I do remember hundreds since that did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was here on Jan. 29, 1961 I was given a patriarchal blessing in which I was promised I should never have any broken bones. My family tell the story of my brothers, Wendell and Sheldon, wanting to prove this theory. When Mother had them taking care of me one day, they instigated a game where one of them tossed me from the hayloft in the barn to the other who was standing in a wagon that was half full of hay. Somehow I managed to slip between the hayloft and the wagon and landed on the ground. I was plenty bruised but no bones broken. This should have given both of them a very good testimony.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“From Rexburg we moved to LaVerkin, Utah. Here I made mud pies, got my Sunday shirts covered with black cherry juice, caught ground squirrels, and generally kept my parents busy. I remember the pool being built at the hot sulphur springs that were so prevalent there, the sargum cane which was being made into sargum, the bantum chickens which were fed from seeds of the sargum cane, watercress growing in the cold water spring that flowed into the Virgin River, and the fresh milk being placed in the cooler for the cream to rise and be skimmed off and made into butter. I remember that the older kids trapped possums, coyotes, bob cats, raccoons, etc., and I remember the horse Father bought Mother, which later contracted lockjaw and had to be shot and dragged by a team of horses to the rim of the gorge and pushed over, a procedure used to dispose of dead animals.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved from LaVerkin to Hinckley, Utah, and lived on a farm. I trapped quimps and kept their heads, as a bounty was being paid for these. I pretended these were all sorts of fur-bearing animals - I was a big trapper! It was here I started first grade. I remember there was a little girl sitting in front of me with long hair. One day I stuck a wad of gum in it. When she fussed, I quickly explained how she could pull out one hair at a time where the gum was and it wouldn’t hurt, by demonstrating on my own hair. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-845" title="845"></span>The result was a round bald spot on my head which was quite difficult to explain to Mother that night when I got home. I remember going with Wendell and Sheldon spearing carp from sloughs and the canal in front of our house. This was the year of the big influenza epidemic - many people died. We were all required to put on masks when we went out of doors to keep from getting the germs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Money was scarce and script was used. I remember Mother making and selling butter. Hers was especially popular because she heaped up the butter mold thus giving about a pound and a quarter instead of the usual pound. One day I took some to a store to sell, called ‘Petty’s’, and when the clerk asked me if I wanted money or script, I told him script was alright. I will never forget how angry mother was with me for taking ‘Petty Script’ when I could have gotten money.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our next move was to Star Ranch. This period seemed one of complete happiness for me. There was a railroad that ran through the ranch and nearby was a section house in which a small boy lived about my age who seemed to have the same interests as I. We made slingshots and played we were big hunters. We shot mourning doves off their nests, hoot owls, caught marsh frogs, fished in the reservoir for fish (mostly carp) which most people considered were unedible but which we roasted and ate everything. Later I was given a twenty-two rifle and added ducks and rabbits to my game bag. I was also given a pony and the job of herding the cows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was customary for the railroad to use the strip of land that passed through our ranch as a rest stop for sheep that were being shipped to market. In the spring there were many lambs which the owners considered nuisance value since they had to be hand-fed, so they gave them to us kids. We considered them fine pets until we discovered they had ringworm, and guess what? Our farm hand had a cure for this. He burned cotton cloth on a cold axe blade which formed a sort of tar which was applied to the ringworm. I assume this worked, since all went well until the lambs were grown. But then Father considered them <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-846" title="846"></span>good food and we were supposed to eat heartily.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Provo was our next move. Here I attended three different schools in a period of two years, and here again we had an epidemic of influenza. I had it, as well as the rest of the family. As I felt better, I made my first trip out to the chicken coop to gather eggs - I was in bed a good week after.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Here I remember making skis out of old barrel staves, carrying them to the top of the chicken coop roof and then skiing down. There was quite a drop at the bottom but I got quite expert at this. I remember also of taking my toy sled into the canyon and cutting and bringing home a Christmas tree.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring another boy and I gathered watercress in the streams above Provo. We washed, tied, and peddled it. At every opportunity I’d go fishing from the bridge that crosses the Provo River. My tackle consisted of a willow, some string, and a fishing hook. With these I was able to catch trout, blue gills, suckers, chubs and bullheads.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved to Salt Lake City and located on Twenty-first South where the Jordan River made a bend and crossed it. We had two or three acres of ground. The place was quite run down and we had lots of work pruning, gardening, repairing the barn, etc. I remember a big apple tree full of redwing black birds who stopped to rest as they migrated south for winter. Our place was located near Redwood Road along which sheep were driven from winter range to summer range in the mountains. This spring, after the shearing of the sheep, the weather became so wet and cold that a good many ewes with lambs nearly froze to death. We were able to buy six ewes for $1.00 each, including nine lambs. We hauled them home in the back of our old touring car, wrapped blankets around them and got them warm and fed them. Out of the whole bunch we only lost one ewe. We kept them until fall and sold all of them for $140.00.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We made us a nice garden. There were a lot of old rhubarb plants in the garden which we separated and transplanted. We had more than we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-847" title="847"></span>had a use for, so I harvested it, did it up in one pound and two pound bunches and peddled it. While working in the garden one morning I saw my first pheasant rooster standing in the plowed ground. The sun was shining on his breast - he was beautiful. At this time we also added a black cow to our homestead. There were lots of fish in the river so I fished a great deal. I don’t believe I ever finished school this year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved to a house on State Street just back of the McKinley School. We had quite a bit of ground and many big trees, mostly poplar which we topped or cut down completely, so we had to cut them up into firewood. We also had a big garden but I managed to still find time to fish and hunt around the Jordan River, Mill Creek, Decker’s Lake and an old slough on the church farm. That summer Father, my brothers and I set out in an old Model T Ford and went as far as Idaho, Montana and Yellowstone Park looking for projects to work. For us boys it was a real pleasure trip.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The fall found us back in Salt Lake for school. I began to trap muskrats and skunks. I would take the streetcar every night after school to Draper, check my traps and skin any animals I had caught. I could take my muskrat pelts on the streetcar but they would not allow me to bring the skunk pelts, so I would leave them and bring them home on my back once a week - a walk of about 17 miles. I remember sometimes getting on the streetcar after skinning the skunks, I would walk to the back of the car and almost simultaneously the people would move to the front and open the windows wide. I sold my pelts to the American Hide and Fur Company. This I did in winter. In the spring I worked in the fields for the Italian truck gardeners. We planted carrots, onions and celery and weeded the gardens. In summer we harvested the vegetables and put them into pits. In fall we washed them and prepared them for market. I made a total of fifteen cents when I worked there after school and thirty-five cents for a whole day on Saturdays.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the sixth grade I began to dislike school. I was receiving poor grades in spelling, arithmetic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-848" title="848"></span>and reading. I remember being very angry in a spelling test when I spelled ‘donut’ and the teacher said it was wrong. I took her over to the window and pointed out to her a sign spelling it this way over a doughnut shop. During the latter part of my seventh year at school my teacher and I seemed to have a difference of opinion as to classroom conduct. Well, to straighten out the difficulty I was to stay each night after school and copy ten pages of an encyclopedia. I had no desire to become afflicted with writer’s cramp or to have increased knowledge, so I made plans to escape the ordeal. After the rest of the class had been excused for the afternoon and the teacher had stepped from the room, I crawled through the window and down the fire escape and went home. That night I began thinking. I was afraid to go back to school next morning and I knew if I didn’t go back my parents would hear what I had done. If they did, I would have worse than writer’s cramp. Finally, I decided to leave home. I hitchhiked to Idaho Falls. It took me two or three days to get there. I found a job there working on a farm and worked until summer (fishing time) and then I hitchhiked to Yellowstone and Jackson Hole. I slept out and enjoyed the out of doors for a month. While on this spree, I met a sheepherder in Island Park, west of Yellowstone. He told me the people he worked for needed a camp tender. I applied at Hamilton Brothers and they hired me. I had plenty of opportunity to experiment with camp cooking. I varied the mutton diet with trout, grouse, and deer that I furnished.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I worked for them until the sheep were taken off summer range and then set off to Parker, Idaho, and worked in the potato harvest that fall. Then for a while I trapped mink, muskrats, coyotes, and did odd jobs for a farmer, who turned out to be a Mormon Bishop and an old student of my father. Through our conversation he found out who I was and reported my whereabouts to my parents. At Christmas time he and his brother took me home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father made arrangements with the LDS School to not hold me back to 7th grade but to let me go onto Jr. High School. I took all the usual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-849" title="849"></span>things plus Seminary. I didn’t do well in most of my subjects but I liked Seminary because we studied Exodus, which involved the Children of Israel traveling through the wilderness living off the land and eating manna and quail. I finished that school year and then returned to Idaho Falls and worked on a farm all that summer and until after school had started the next fall.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I then returned to Salt Lake and started school again. This time it was a South Jr. High School. This winter I went back to trapping and also did real well in school. I won first place in a writing competition and had the opportunity to read my paper at the assembly for the whole school. I also was in the operetta and was the only baritone, as I was the only boy whose voice had changed. I needed a car for my work with the traps. We had an old car in the garage in need of repairs. I got it all fixed up but I lost out to Wendell who had just returned from his mission and took possession of the car to go courting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“That summer I chauffeured my Dad to California. We worked with mining claims in San Gabriel Canyon. That fall we returned to Salt Lake City and I to the South Jr. High. The following spring I came back to California. I told Father I wanted to stay here and work for a sporting goods place. We weren’t successful in finding this type of work, but I got a job at Glendale Small Animal Hospital that summer and continued on for the rest of the year. The following fall I worked for the hospital in the mornings before I went to Herbert Hoover High School, and for a supply company after school. On Saturdays I worked for the Humane Society taking the dead animals down to the rendering plant. At this time I bought a little apple green Chevrolet roadster with a rumble seat. I had a tin box which fit in the rumble seat where I carried the dead dogs. The first trip in my new car I had an accident, with dead dogs flying every which way. People gathered and were feeling so sorry for my poor little dogs that had been killed; little did they know that the dogs had been dead for several days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-850" title="850"></span>“This year I really took an interest in school. I received straight A’s and again I sang in the school operetta. I went to school here for two years but still lacked credit to graduate. I had become interested in veterinary medicine and so I applied to Washington State College for entrance. They accepted me and said to come to the college and I could make up the credit. I enrolled in the Pullman High School and took part time work at the College. I graduated from high school there. I had met some boys at the Veterinary Hospital in Glendale who were also attending Washington State College in the school of Veterinary Medicine, so five of us batched together. I did the cooking and they did the housework. That summer I came back to California and went to work for the Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital for Dr. Fosbinder. This was the spring of 1932, a time of depression when wages were low. I never made over $100.00 a month until I graduated with my D.V.M. degree. My free time was Wednesday and Friday nights and every other Sunday. I enjoyed my work here. I drove the ambulance and really learned the city well. I met a lot of famous stars in this way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“This fall I met my girl through my sister who was here going to Art Center school. After dating her for three months she left for San Francisco. Once a month I went to visit her there. I would drive all night Saturday after work, spend Sunday with her, then drive all night Sunday night to get back in time for work Monday morning. On one telephone call to San Francisco, I had carefully looked up the rate (ninety cents for three minutes), I just naturally assumed that the operator would tell me when the three minutes were up. As time went by and she didn’t tell me I thought she had forgotten and that I was talking for free. I was floored when she called back to verify my $12.50 call.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Nov. 17, 1934 my brother Wendell, who was then a Mormon Bishop, married us at his home in Los Angeles. He managed to misspell her last name so we really never knew whether we were legally married until we went through the Los Angeles Temple twenty-seven years and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-851" title="851"></span>six children later (15 Apr. 1961). (His wife is the former Velda Ruth Johnson, born 4 Jan. 1912 in Duchesne, Utah to Oscar Emanuel and Sophia Deseret Baldwin Johnson).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I wanted to get back to college and get my degree. Two years passed while Velda and I worked together toward achieving this goal. She managed a ten unit court in exchange for our apartment and utilities. I kept on at the hospital. In Feb. 1936 our first son, Steven, was born. September of 1937 found us in Pullman, Washington with our hard earned savings. We hoped with careful handling and my working all vacations that this would see us through school. In Dec. 1937 our son Kent was born, and by the end of this school year we had used over half of our savings. In the light of this situation, Velda decided to go to work the following fall. She applied for and got a position as secretary of the National Youth Administration at the college. This she did until I graduated in 1942 with my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. During the time while we were saving to go back to school, the curriculum had changed from a four to a five year course - I had to go the five years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“School was a tremendous satisfaction to me. My record throughout the entire five years was almost straight A’s. This made it possible for me to get into the scholarship honorary, Phi Kappa Phi, the Veterinary Medicine honorary Alpha Psi, and the Biological honorary Phi Sigma.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After graduation I returned to California with my family, and the Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital - this time as a Doctor. I worked for Dr. Fosbinder for $500.00 a month for six months and then went into partnership with him. In 1944 I bought the business from Dr. Fosbinder for $10,000 and leased the buildings and grounds from him. The years that followed were very demanding; I worked long hours. Sometimes I had an assistant and sometimes I worked alone but we usually found time for a two week vacation. This became somewhat of a custom: We met at my sister Edythe’s home in Mill Creek Canyon, Salt Lake City, with all my brothers and sisters and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-852" title="852"></span>their families and proceeded in a caravan to Sheridan, Montana, Yellowstone and the Glacier Park area. Our children loved this association with their cousins and it has been a means of keeping our families close through the years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1943 our third son, Philip, was born and in 1948 we were delighted when our first girl, Kathleen, was born. She truly seemed like a little princess to us after having three boys. This happiness ended abruptly when she was taken from us just three days before her third birthday. As time went on we managed to pick up the pieces and tried to establish a firm footing again. This was helped by the birth of our fourth son, Paul, in Jan. 1953. He was a bright, busy, interested little boy and soon had our household humming again. In 1958 we were blessed with another boy whom we named Allen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, in 1950, I bought the hospital outright for $46,000.00. It took us ten years to pay for it - this is the way Dr. Fosbinder wanted it set up or I’m sure we could have managed it sooner. I also found a fascinating new hobby - photography. Lots of new interests came into our lives when in 1961 we went through the Temple, taking all our sons with us. My mother and most of my brothers and sisters went with us. We had our daughter sealed to us also at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I retired in 1963 - sold my business and leased the building and ground. We are able to live from this income. Shortly after retiring I joined the Sierra Club. I have always been interested in conservation. I have taken many wonderful trips with this club, including two to Alaska, some in Mexico, and many backpack trips in the Sierras. Also, all through the years I have maintained my interest in hunting and fishing as well as my photography and have traveled quite extensively. I have had wonderful luck with my colored slides and have a vast library of them. I have received quite a lot of recognition with them from the Southern California Camera Club. I have also shown them to many groups of people. It has been a real source of pleasure to us as a family in our entertaining.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-853" title="853"></span>“Our three oldest boys graduated from the University of Southern California - Steven from Medical School, Kent and Philip from Dental. Paul is looking forward to being an Orthodontist, while Allen is delightful, perverse and stubborn, but looks more like me than any child we have and is probably made up just like me. We love them all dearly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We are still living in our same little house in the San Fernando Valley. We appreciated the comfort and peace we feel in our home. We have quite a lot of freedom through the day while the two younger boys are at school, and we take in many interests, such as: Yachts in the harbor, new model homes, sport shows, musicals, art exhibits, etc. Velda and I find that we enjoy the same things. We are interested in our church activities and are hoping to buy us a new camper a year from now and really see the world. I feel much as the quotation in Psalms: ‘My cup runneth over’”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To bring this story up to date, they did buy the new camper - and guess what? They sold out in California and bought a new home in Provo, Utah, moving the first of this year, 1969. They are now busy furnishing their home, finishing the basement and landscaping the grounds. Welcome to Provo dear Cousins!</p>
