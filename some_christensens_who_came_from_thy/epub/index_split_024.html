  <p class="calibre1">The lack of resident doctor’s services was sorely felt at times. Fear and compassion were mingled when epidemics of contagion spread from home to home, and feelings of helplessness were present when new babies were coming. The health of their families was one of the major concerns of most pioneer mothers. In rural areas like Gunnison Valley, folks had to depend upon old and simple homemade remedies and the blessings of the Elders of the church to carry them through trials of sickness. Senna tea was used as a laxative, sagebrush tea or sulphur-and-molasses made a good spring tonic. Often a few herbs administered with faith brought about wonderful results. From fall until spring it was the custom for most children to wear an asafetida bag a piece, tied on a string around their necks, to prevent them from catching diseases or colds. Even midwives were scarce and somewhat poorly trained at best. In Mayfield, Else K. Christensen, Sena Larson, Margaret Voorhees Whitlock and Anna Carlson were the ladies credited as having assisted greatly in the care of the sick during the latter 1870’s. Many hours were spent by them nursing back to health men, women and children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There had been sickness in the Laurs M. C. <span id="page-280"></span> Christensen home, the latest being the illness of the oldest son Christian, or Chris as he was called. Somehow he had contracted a most serious eye infection which had progressed to the point that the sight of the right eye at least was despaired of. In all the region there was not a doctor or nurse to whom they could turn for help. Else poulticed, salved and prayed. Laurs did what he could, and the Elders were called in to assist him in administering to the afflicted youngster. His grandfather Christen was sent for and traveled back and forth from Gunnison to advise and help, having had excellent success in curing ailing animals from time to time. The struggle seemed long and at times most discouraging, but with the kind blessings of the Lord, together with all the special care and treatment his loved ones could give him, young Chris grew back to health and strength again and his sight was preserved. The infection nevertheless had damaged the tear duct of his right eye, thus allowing an occasional tear to fall on his cheek regardless of whether he was glad or sad. This “falling of tears” continued throughout the lifetime of this pleasant-natured fellow. His family called them “happy tears”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This experience brought more forcefully to Else’s mind something she had been thinking about for quite awhile. Why couldn’t she herself be trained in the medical skills? The urge to act in that direction had come to her from time to time as she worked with the sick, but now the necessity of it almost overwhelmed her. In vain she had tried to force the thoughts of such a possibility from her mind. The promptings of the “still small voice” became so strong, however, that she could ignore them no longer. Laurs also realized the great responsibility of trying to raise a family with so little knowledge of diseases, etc., and no available doctors. He agreed that she should be given the opportunity to seek medical training, but how?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were so many drawbacks! Else’s family needed her. Small Emma was not yet two and little Elsie, with a mind of her own, was scarcely four. Laurs had his hands full making ends meet without having the full care of two little</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-281"></span> girls and four active boys besides. Then there was the problem of money — of this they had little and none at all to spare for the various expenses that would have to be met if she went away to study, even for a short period. But Else was a woman of unusual faith. She had made difficult moves and decisions before in her life and she knew that if this course was important to their future the way would be opened for her to accomplish it. She sought help in prayer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then word came of the tragedy that had struck the Myrups in Gunnison. Again we quote from the rememberings of Lois M. Anderson:— “My father was 9 years old. He had been told to watch his baby sister, Karen Laurine, who was less than two years old. (Her cousin Emma’s age.) Like most little boys he got interested in something else and forgot the little sister and she fell into a cistern or barrel of water and was drowned.” (Niels Christian Myrup grieved about this the rest of his life and never got over feeling that he was responsible.) Maren was well along with her sixth child at the time and this was hard on her indeed. That Laurs and Else drove to Gunnison to offer aid and comfort can well be imagined, for this was a close-knit family. And that Else at the time had grave misgivings at the thoughts of leaving her own baby Emma and her other children, can also be readily believed. Her dreams must have been troubled as she went on with her planning and preparation to leave her family for awhile. She wished before leaving, however, to see Maren safely through her delivery.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 10 May 1879, just two months following the sad death of her baby girl, Maren gave birth to her fourth son, Joseph Henry Myrup. The very next day Else left home to take the train to Salt Lake City, where medical training was available. Laurs drove her in the wagon to the railroad terminal at York, just over the Sanpete County line into Juab. Here she took the train headed for Salt Lake City. She had borrowed money for her ticket and a little extra from a friend. She had arranged also for a Sister Anderson to look after things at home in her absence. No doubt <span id="page-282"></span> this lady had been duly cautioned to “keep the little ones from the water!” The children must have been a handful for Sister Anderson at best. In Elsie C. Bartholomew’s history she tells something of her reaction at being left at home:— “At the age of four I became tired of home life, mother having gone to Salt Lake City to study how to take care of the sick. Sister Anderson, who was caring for the family in mother’s absence, did not please me; so I took my belongings and went through our garden to the next lot where the Mortensons lived. They were grandma and grandpa to me. When I got there I had lost one of my hand knit stockings. I retraced my steps back to our garden and there it was, hanging on a gooseberry bush.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else K. Christensen must have had a great deal of confidence in her own capacity, or a great deal of determination, or both. Though she had made no prearrangements and had arrived at the railroad station in Salt Lake City that llth of May 1879, practically a stranger, she seemed to know exactly where she was going. Whether it was shown her in a dream (as some have said) or had come to her through inquiry or in some other manner, we cannot say. Truly she was gifted with dreams and great spiritual insight - who are we to say how she knew her way then? Be that as it may, she went directly to the home of an aged woman doctor of medicine originally from Denmark, knocked on the door, introduced herself, stated her mission and, after only a moments hesitation, was admitted by the elderly doctor herself, for she lived alone. Else was without sufficient money for board and room for any length of time at all, let alone any to pay for medical instruction; yet here she was in the home of this talented lady asking for these very services.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nicolene Olsen, Doctress and Midwife, was suffering from an ailment of long-standing and had discontinued her practice years before. She had taken female students into her home from time to time since then however, to train them in the art of children’s diseases, obstetrics and general medicine, in which she had specialized. This she now had also ceased to do, vowing to teach no more <span id="page-283"></span> and turning a number away who had sought her assistance. But there was something about Else K. Christensen that so impressed her that she could not say her nay (nej). Somehow the favored Else came to an agreement with Sister Olsen and it is quite probable that she was allowed to work for the aged woman in return for her lodgings and training. On the flyleaf of a medium sized hard backed journal the next day. Else wrote, with scratch pen and purple ink, the following in Danish (translated):— “Began the 12th May on my instruction with Sister N. Olsen. Salt Lake City 1879.”<sup id="fnref:4" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else stayed at the home of Mrs. Olsen, who spent practically all of her available time for the next month training this eager and capable woman in medical skills. They had no language problem, as each was well versed in Danish, nor were there any personality or other problems to stand in the way of learning. Else had remarkable power to grasp and remember the things she heard; thus she gained rapidly a comprehensive knowledge of obstetrics and the general practice of medicine. Furthermore, Sister Olsen gave her a number of her medical books and dictated various methods and treatments, remedy recipes and directions which Else copied neatly into her journal in Danish.<sup id="fnref:5" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:5">5</a></sup> Her training also included some practical experience, for she delivered at least one child in the | process. This item was written in her journal: — “Br. Smith, S. L. C. en datter den 9 June 1879. (From then on for the next fourteen years she recorded the father’s name, and sex and date of birth of hundreds of other babies she ushered into the world.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the generous Danish lady had taught her student all she herself had learned in her medical studies in Copenhagen, besides much she had acquired throughout years of practice, the period of intensive training was ended and Else was ready to return home to her husband and children, as well as to begin her new career. But first she purchased some tools-of-the-trade as it were, which included, among other smaller items, a blood-letting knife. Likely some whiskey <span id="page-284"></span> (she wrote it “Hvisky”) was also included since this was called for in various of the treatments she had studied. She also purchased a middle-sized brown satchel or kit, in which to carry her professional equipment.<sup id="fnref:6" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:6">6</a></sup> Upon her leaving, the gracious teacher bid her a tearful farewell, for they had grown to be staunch friends, and gave her the following letter of recommendation (translated from the Danish):— “Salt Lake City, June 14, 1879 - It is Sister Christensen’s wish to live to be an excellent midwife and to bring help and happiness to suffering humanity so that she may be an honor to God and a blessing to his people. I myself felt that I didn’t want to give any more instruction in this work, because of my weakness and long lasting ailment I have had to fight. But when Sister Christensen stepped to my door there was an unexplainable spirit that attended her and it was impossible for me to refuse her. As I became acquainted with her I realized that she was a most worthy person, and she has proved in every way to be superior to anyone I have ever trained in my home in this work - this dear, unforgettable daughter of God. And because of this, with willingness and in all sincerity, I give her the very best recommendation to anyone who under any condition may need the sincere help of Sister Christensen. She will attend them and care for and protect them as a mother of Israel, with love and wisdom and with sympathy and patience. This is my full conviction. Wherefore I am satisfied to leave her in the hands of God, and anyone who needs her help, with my very best recommendation. And may the Lord of Israel bless her entrance into and exit from every home is my prayer, in Jesus’ name - Amen. Nicolene Olsen, Midwife and Doctress.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">When Else returned to Mayfield she was at once called into service. The nearest regular doctors were at Manti and Ephraim and so her help was greatly needed, not only in her own town but in all of South Sanpete. She had only been home a day or two when she was called to deliver a new baby, recorded thus in her medical <span id="page-285"></span> journal:—“Lars Greekkersen (prob. Gregersen) en datter den 17 June 1879.” It wasn’t long before her ability became known in the towns neighboring on Mayfield, from Salina on the south to Pettyville (Sterling) on the north. Else made her work one of mercy and love. With her brown kit in one hand and a bowl of Danish soup in the other, she went forth serving the sick and the needy. Members of her family soon became accustomed to the sound of heavy wagons rattling up the street and stopping at their place any time of night or day. Then Else would be off on her missions of mercy, for she was usually prepared to leave at almost a moment’s notice.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whether she assisted at the birth of Christen and Anne’s last child and fifth son, George Ludvig Christensen, 20 Aug. 1879, was not recorded in her journal. (This child only lived one-and-a-half years, passing away 11 Feb. 1881). But surely Else must have been summoned to the same home and the bedside of Christen and Karen’s twenty year old daughter Petrine, some two weeks later. We have no details of the cause of Petrine’s death, only that she succumbed 8 Sept. 1879 in Gunnison. This lovely girl was engaged to be married at the time to Jens Mikkelsen (later of Manti). Her loss must have been a cause of much sorrow to her loved ones and friends. Death is sad at any time but when one is in the full bloom of youth with so many plans and hopes for the future, it can seem sadder. (She was not soon forgotten by Jens Mikkelsen, for 26 Mar. 1903 he and his wife then went to the Manti temple where he was sealed to Petrine Christensen for eternity, and his wife stood for her.) Caskets of wood for the deceased were made locally then by one James Hansen of Centerfield. In those days they were covered with a black material and it was not until about 1886 that white covered coffins were first used in the area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But there were happy times too, especially for the children. Christmastime was always celebrated with much gaiety in the Christensen household, with the traditional Danish ways of holding Yule mingled with pioneer customs. Christmas <span id="page-286"></span> Eve was the important family gathering time when one and all mingled their voices in laughter and song and, holding hands, danced around the candle lighted Christmas tree. Then the “Yule Nisser”, “Christmas Elves”, “Santa’s Brownies”, or whatever they chanced to call them then, would be expected and the children would be rushed off to bed after hanging up their stockings and putting out a dish of rice mush or pudding on the doorstep to feed the night visitors. (This Christmas Eve family evening became so firmly established in the L.M.C. Christensen home that it has endured among some of his descendants for three generations.) Presents for the children’s Christmas would be mostly homemade things: perhaps marbles made from clay, berry stained red-cheeked rag dolls, dolls carved from wood with hair of black sheep’s wool or modest corncob dolls; molasses or honey candy and pinenuts and pine and spruce gum gathered from the mountains. If a feast could not be spread at any other time of the year, Else would at least manage one for Christmas Day - stuffed goose, pork or sausage, sweet soup made with sego, dried currants, prunes and cinnamon-stick, coffee cake and a kettle of fragrant Danish soup steaming around plump islands of Danish dumplings for accompaniment. The last day of each year was the traditional time for a community party for the children there. On New Year’s Eve in Mayfield, that year of 1879, “the meeting house, bedecked with evergreen banners and rosettes, was turned into a fairy bower, Santa Claus, standing between two giant Christmas trees illuminated with scores of candles, gave a welcome to all. Each of the 120 children present drew prizes from the trees.” It is quite certain that at least the five older children of Laurs and Else Christensen were among those there to draw prizes as well as to enjoy the excitement of the festivities.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In spite of the unprecedented cold weather in the spring and early summer of 1879, when sugar cane froze three times in June and the maize twice in July, the crops had been about normal. The acorn crop in the mountains, however, had been particularly abundant, which, according to Indian legend, foretold a hard winter ahead. Two <span id="page-287"></span> venturesome gentlemen decided to profit by this acorn crop and thus turned a large number of hungry hogs loose in Twelve Mile Canyon to feed on them. But the two “gentlemen” quarreled and the project was apparently abandoned. By the late fall the pigs refused to live on the acorns any longer and came out of the mountains and down into the fields around Mayfield by the hundreds. Some of them were penned by the people, as no one seemed to own them. Laurs and his boys captured a couple of the roaming hogs, as others were doing, and penned them up in their back yard. It seems none were prepared for the exceptionally severe winter that followed. Snow fell to an abnormal depth early in the season, piled up high during the winter, and kept up so late in the spring of 1880 that animals of all kinds could not find anything to eat in the fields or on the range.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In his recollections Albert tells of the tragedy that was suffered by the Laurs Christensen family at that time:— “Soon all of the feed at home was gone and our animals were kept alive only by eating the straw from the straw sheds. Father had a yoke of oxen, “Tom” and “Jim”, one old milch cow, “Bluebell” and a heifer “Lillie”, that would calve in the spring or summer. These were the hope and pride of the family. With careful feeding, father managed to winter his oxen, cow and heifer. The hogs were butchered. As soon as vegetation commenced to grow in the spring, he turned our oxen and the young heifer out to forage on the foothills east of Mayfield with the hope that they could get food sufficient to survive. We kept track of them and at first they seemed to be doing well.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One day, however, my brother Joseph and I were hiking about in those east hills barefoot. We first found Lillie in a hollow, dead. She was swelled up with her legs sticking up in the air. Then we went in search of Tom and Jim. We found Tom all right up on a side hill south of where we had located Lillie’s body. We found Jim further up on the hill; his back was downhill, his legs were in the air - he was dead. Doubtless the two had eaten poison weeds. Now we just had the old cow Bluebell, who was dry, and the ox Tom. <span id="page-288"></span> This was indeed bad news for the family.” These crushing losses during such hard times made a vivid impression on seven-and-a-half year old Albert at the time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For Laurs himself this catastrophe, coupled with the hardships and emotional strain of the past few years plus the economic uncertainty and anxiety of the present, seemed like a last straw. He became despondent and discouraged and his health and courage began to break. In this unhappy condition he seemed, at least momentarily, to have blamed the Bishop and even the Church itself for this misfortune; having, in a quandary to know what to do with his starving animals that desperate spring, asked the advice of the Bishop and taken it. Echoing far off down the musty corridors of time we hear the words of a somewhat tense domestic drama, similar to one which reportedly took place in Mayfield that spring of 1880… The despairing voice of Laurs:— “Let’s give it all up and go back to Denmark where we belong! I’m sick and tired of the never-ending struggle of it all. Ever since we left the Old Country we have had little else but grief, worry, toil and failure!”… Then the answering voice of the oft outspoken Else, weary with the burden of her tenth child, yet unborn:— “I gave up my family, home, friends, all that I then held dear for the sake of the Gospel. I risked my life with you on the angry sea; I walked by your side over vast plains and rugged mountains, in the scorch of sun - the beat of wind and rain - the chill of snow; I held my ears to shut out the shrieks of murdering Indians and pounding of drums, as I bore your first sons; I have feared for my life and at times gone hungry; I have slaved and toiled with you, and born your many children - I have buried one of our own flesh and blood. Now if you think I am going to ‘give it all up’, as you suggest, and take our sons and daughters far away from the influence and strength and blessings of Zion to raise, because of an old dead cow, you are not the man I thought you to be! You may go - but you will go alone” . . and that ended it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Discouragement can weaken body and mind and cause even the spirit to falter at times. Laurs <span id="page-289"></span> too was a thoroughbred in every sense of the word. He also had given up much for the Gospel and almost everything for his wife and children. He had not only done his own work, trying to build and provide for his family, but had of course taken a great deal of the responsibility of the home while Else had been in training, and continued to do so while she was acting as nurse and doctor. While he could not do the heavy house-work, he did more than his share in caring for the children. He had provided them with a fairly comfortable three-roomed adobe house there in South Mayfield, with a log granary, cow sheds, pigpen, chicken coup, outhouse and other needed additions in back. (These were well built for most of them are still standing.) He was faithful to the Church and his Priesthood, honest in his dealings with man and God, a kind, helpful and devoted husband and a wonderfully patient, understanding and loving father. Hard-working as his strength would allow, he was also dependable as the coming of night after day. He seldom complained and cast off most of his troubles with a shrug of his shoulders and a witty remark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Can one think of Grandma Else without Grandpa Laurs? Nej, nej, for they belonged together. The thorns and thistles in our paths of life may retard our progress briefly. It is no disgrace to stumble o’er them. The important thing is that we rise again and go forward, even though bruised and torn, fighting our way along. It is not what one has to contend with along the way of life but what one is able to endure and overcome that signals success.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs squared his shoulders again, yoked Tom up with the neighbor’s ox, put his hand to the plough and went forward with his farm work. Then Else gave birth to their tenth child, Lars Peter Christensen (later changed to Louis D.) Saturday 20 Mar. 1880, there in their home in Mayfield. According to the record in her journal she took care of the delivery herself, though she likely leaned heavily on her husband for help at the time. This, their fifth son, must have been a good sized baby for he grew to be the largest of their children, <span id="page-290"></span> They had this infant named and blessed at the church 3rd June by Bishop Ole C. Olsen. He was a fair child with curly blonde hair, a mischievous smile and a powerful pair of lungs. It soon became apparent that he would make his voice heard in the world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else’s work with the sick now took her to all parts of Gunnison Valley. If it was as a midwife she went her fee not only included delivering the baby but taking care of it and the mother as well, during her confinement or “lying in” period, which lasted on the average of two weeks. She also did some of the housework and the washing for her patients. She was often paid in other than money; for example:— (From her journal) “Mrs. King came and paid… peaches .60, butter .60, wheat $1.60, hat .25 = $3.05 - owe $11.80; Frandsen came the 6 Jan… wood $2.00, 2 dolly $2.00 - paid $15, . etc.” But whether she was paid in cash or produce her earnings must have helped a great deal to give a lift to the sagging economy of the hard-pressed family, proving to be a blessing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">An increasing number of Else’s patients were now coming from the town of Gunnison, which was more central and held by far the larger part of the valley’s population. It was decided that it would be much more convenient for the family if they would pick up and leave Mayfield and move back to Gunnison. Else could look in on her loved ones more often while working there and educational opportunities for the children would be better also. So Laurs found a buyer for his home and small farm, one Lars P. Jensen from Pleasant Grove, Utah County. As a down payment Brother Jensen gave Laurs a wagon and team of horses, we are not aware of what else. It appears that the deal was made sometime around the fore part of July 1880, but the property was not completely paid for until 10 Apr. 1906, at which date it was deeded by Laurs to the other party.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their brother-in-law, Lars Myrup, made one of his two homes in Gunnison available to them and their brood of seven that early summer. As far as we can ascertain this small adobe house was <span id="page-291"></span> in the eastern part of town about a half mile west of where Christen, Anne and their family were settled. It appears that Myrup’s other Gunnison home was in the southern part of town just east of the main street which led south to “the Field” or South Gunnison; for here, it has been said, he owned about a city block of land. He also owned an extensive farm near the sugar factory in those south fields and was building a new home in that area. Though a number of families were already living on their farms there, in the early 1880s settlers moved out into South Gunnison in great numbers, including the families of Laurs Myrup and Andrew and Pauline Andersen. Many new homes were built, some of adobe, some of logs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon after moving back to Gunnison, Laurs Christensen leased a farm in Christenburg, about three or four miles from where they then lived, from a large landowner and stockraiser by the name of Julius H. Christensen (no relation). Mr. Christensen and his two brothers, Theodore and Titus, owned a great deal of the land in that desirable location midway between Gunnison and Mayfield. In fact, they had been the first to take up land and move their families there, and it was after them that this sprawling, scattered farming area of Christenburg had been named. The early spring of the next year (1881) Laurs and Else and their children moved from the Myrup home in East Gunnison to a rented house in North Christenburg, known as Antelope Valley, to be nearer their leased farm. The earliest homes there were three-room ranch type dwellings with walls of adobe. “Wild flowers and grass, seeded by the wind and watered by the rain, covered the thick sod on each roof in their time and season.” Here to this choice farming land lying east and north of Chalk Hill and bordering the Sanpitch River, Laurs brought his family to live for the next three or four summers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime he purchased an acre of ground in the northwest part of Gunnison on which stood a small adobe house with two rooms, facing south and standing back a considerable distance from the street. In this his family lived during <span id="page-292"></span> the winters. Soon a larger house was erected just south and west of the old one and both places were used to house the large Christensen family in winters for a year or so until the new house could be completed. This house was built mostly ofrock hauled from the quarry north of Gunnison cemetery. Eventually the new house boasted three good sized rooms besides a kitchen and pantry on the ground floor plus one large unfinished and two small finished rooms in the attic upstairs, used for sleeping. Whether the new rock house was sufficiently completed in time to welcome Laurs’ and Else’s second pair of twins is not known, but that they were born in one or the other of those two houses on the corner of first north and second west in Gunnison is a certainty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These second twins, a boy anda girl, were born at 4 o’clock in the morning, Wed. 19 July 1882, and according to Else’s journal she had no attending midwife other than herself. The little ones were feeble however, and help was sent for to give them names and blessings. Grandfather Christen Christensen came and blessed the first child, a boy, giving him the name Arthur Marinus Christensen. Brother John Wasden, a neighbor from across the street, gave the little girl a blessing and the name Martine Lauriette, the second name for Laurs, but she died about 12 noon that same day. And so another little spirit went to join her sister and others of her departed kin in Paradise. The boy Arthur lived and, under the tender and expert care of his fond mother, grew in health and strength and wisdom. It was not until Feb. l, 1883, however, that they took him to church for his official christening.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is a great thing to deliver one’s own twin babies; but when we consider that Else delivered at least twenty-six babies in 1882, one of them a daughter for Hans Jensen just six days before her twins came, another a daughter for Lars Myrup nineteen days after, the picture becomes far more involved, and we are led to feel nothing but amazement at the accomplishments of this remarkable woman. We are not forgetting for a moment either that when possible she did much of the housework <span id="page-293"></span> and took care of the mothers and babies she brought, until the mothers were up and around again. Of course she had the help of her family, as well as a hired girl in the home much of the time, but nevertheless she was simply marvelous during those crowded years of her medical service. Her brown kit was always ready, standing by the side of her bedroom door, and there were many sick that she attended, aside from her duties as midwife, for folks came to her from all over the valley and she answered their calls willingly and promptly. It will always be a mystery how Else K. continued her work of love and mercy for others without neglecting her own family, but the health and education of her children was one of her chief concerns and was always taken care of in the best possible manner. She was also concerned with the health of her husband and tried to keep him in top physical condition. We have been told that one of the methods she used on Laurs for this purpose was to thin his blood every spring with her blood-letting knife. As a spring tonic for her children, however, she used the less severe treatment of sulphur and molasses or a big dose of epsom salts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Maren Myrup’s seventh child was born, 10 May 1881, Else was at the delivery bed of her beloved sister-in-law. Little Sarahann Myrup, however, only lived about sixteen months and then passed away (Sept. 1882). It was about this time that an incident happened involving Maren and her second son Niels, and told as follows by Lois M. Anderson:— “My father told me one story that I shall always remember. When he was about ten years old he was sent to help his grandfather, Christen Christensen, doing odd jobs around the yard. One morning when he arrived his grandpa accused him of taking some of his tools. Father denied this but his grandpa apparently didn’t believe him and gave him a good ‘cuffing’ to force him to tell the truth. When young Niels got away he ran home and told his mother, the lovely, ladylike little Maren, who promptly ordered the boys to hitch up the buggy and taking her son Niels alongside on the seat, and with the buggy whip in her <span id="page-294"></span> hand, set out to confront her father. Niels said later that sitting there looking at his irate little mother with the whip in her hand, he began to fear for his grandfather. Maren was convinced that her son was telling the truth. When they arrived at her father’s place, Christen apologized to them both. I cannot remember whether the tools were found or not but I don’t suppose Maren sent her young son to work for his grandfather again, at least not that year. I think our great-grandfather Christensen was a rather stern man, at any rate for our day.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nearly nine months following the death of Maren’s little Sarahann, Else was called in to deliver another baby for her. Manda May Myrup, born in Gunnison 24 May 1883, was Maren’s eighth and last child, for this young thirty-four-and-a-half year old mother was not permitted to watch over the lives of her children in mortality much longer. When tiny Manda lacked eleven days of being two months old, Maren died very suddenly (13 July 1883) of what was later believed to be appendicitis, although it was not known by that name then. Lars Myrup’s second wife, Marie, took little Manda to care for but the small child only outlived her mother less than a month, dying in August that same year. Thus the plucky little Danish emigrant pioneer and mother, Maren, came to her life’s end and her body rested at length beside those of her three infant daughters in the Gunnison cemetery. Her oldest daughter Mary and four sons, Lars or Lewis C., Niels C., Adolph M., and Joseph Henry survived her and lived to marry and bring a sizable posterity into the world to honor the memory of Maren Christensen Myrup.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else K. felt concern for her sister-in-law’s children and after their mother’s death looked in on them often to see how they were getting along with their “hot-tempered stepmother”. Maren’s boys were still sleeping in the granary at the Myrup place when they all took measles and had them very bad. Else went out time and again to help doctor them. They all thought a great deal of their Aunt Else. A little later on the son Niels developed the nervous disorder, St. Vitus’ Dance, <span id="page-295"></span> and Else again traveled back and forth to Centerfield to doctor him. She gave him some nerve medicine which helped him sleep at nights. The treatments must have been effective for the malady didn’t stay long with him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those summers in the early 1880s when the Laurs Christensen family moved out into Antelope Valley (North Christenburg) must have been looked forward to especially by the children. Though the older ones helped their father on the farm there or herded sheep or cattle, there was always time to roam barefoot through the meadows, play hide-and-go-seek, pomp-pomp-pull-away or such with the children of Ole and Inger Larsen, who lived neighbors, or go swimming with them in the “Big Hole”, a bend in the Sanpitch River back of the Larsens’ barn. It was while swimming here in the Big Hole that little Elizabeth Larsen, about four years old, had been drowned. They found her small body one mile down stream.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else K. was of course still going out from here on her missions of mercy. One of the older Larsen children, Caroline, remembered that one evening when Sister Christensen had just returned from one of her longer periods of doctoring, her son Albert ran out to greet her with these words, “Mother we are having clabber milk and lettuce for supper!” Perhaps Caroline thought this a very strange meal, but no doubt young Albert knew how much his mother enjoyed clabber-milk. In her memoirs Caroline Larsen recalled other things about the Christensens. She remembered Albert as being a very spiritual child; for sometimes, when the children were all playing there together, Albert would come up missing. When they hunted they would often find him in some thick bushes or trees - praying. So then they would all tiptoe away very quietly and wait, never saying a word to him about it afterwards. Though Caroline was nearer Joseph’s and Albert’s age she was drawn to their eldest brother Christian. Later there in Christenburg she and Christian became childhood sweethearts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not far north from the Christensen and Larsen homes there was a sheep-shearing corral, which <span id="page-296"></span> had been maintained from the early years of Christenburg’s settlement. As many as 40,000 head of sheep on their way from the desert to the summer range were sheared there annually by experts, some of them from Antelope Valley. We have been told that Else K. Christensen sheared many sheep at this corral in those early days and that she could outshear many of the men. When the sheep came in for shearing in the early spring, small hills of wool-filled sacks would pile up at the corral. It was great sport for the children who lived nearby, and others who came in with owners of the herds, to clamber up and jump down or chase each other back and forth over and around these huge piles of filled wool-sacks. Sometimes whole families would come in during sheep shearing time and make a days picnic of it. This shearing corral was kept up well into the twentieth century. The Larsen and Christensen children enjoyed this fun year after year in those early Christenburg days, as some of their children and even their grandchildren did after them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At one time in Christenburg a heart-rending experience happened in the Christensen household. One cool evening, perhaps in early spring or late fall, a hot log fire was ablaze in the fireplace of their dwelling, to warm things. Young Louis, about four years old, had been snuggled into one of his father’s old coats and was standing near the open fire to make doubly sure of getting warmed up. The coat almost dragged the floor and its sleeves hung well down over his chubby hands. In an unguarded moment the small boy reached out his arms towards the dancing flames and at that instant the right sleeve of the coat caught fire and before the pain-stricken, screaming child could be given the necessary help by his distracted parents, the four fingers of his right hand were so terribly burned, down to the very knuckles, that they could not be saved. All of his mother’s medical powers and the spiritual strength of the entire family was brought to bear in an effort to heal the seared flesh of suffering little “Lou”. Proud flesh set in and it was with much difficulty that Else was able to save the hand proper. She often told of how she worked, wept, and prayed to save that hand! Nobs grew on <span id="page-297"></span> the stumps but the fingers never grew in again, but with the help of the Lord the main part of the hand was preserved and became useful again; for Louis learned to use this maimed hand with great dexterity in the years that followed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was there in Christenburg, 10 July 1884, that a church Patriarch by the name of K. H. Brown, along with his Danish scribe Antone C. Sorensen, came to the Christensen home by appointment to give blessings of counsel and encouragement to various members of the family. Laurs and Else had blessings at that time, as well as Albert, Elsie and even little Louis, and perhaps most of the other family members who were at home at the time. Since the mother Else’s blessing had so much influence on her later life, as perhaps was true of the others also, we wish to quote parts of it here:— “… If you will listen to your husband’s advice and to the voice of the ‘still small spirit’ the Lord shall give you holy visions by day and holy dreams at night, clothe you with power from on high so that you shall have wisdom to manage your house, be a comfort and support to your husband, and a good mother to your children… You shall be known of the Lord and your seed shall be blessed by him… You shall have wisdom to do much good among your brothers and sisters in Zion and the Lord shall bless you with faith… the works of your hands shall be blessed. Your pantry shall always be full and your children never lack for the good things of life… Your posterity shall be blessed and shall be a star in your crown and a comfort in your old age… You were chosen to come forth here on the earth in order to accomplish a great mission, along with your husband and family, for your father’s and mother’s lineage, those who are now dead and in prison waiting to be freed by you and your family… Because of your obedience to the Gospel and your faithfulness throughout trials you shall live to see, while still in the flesh, your children and grandchildren receive possessions in the Stakes of Zion and the Spirit of the Lord rest upon them.” It was through this blessing that summer’s day in Christenburg, that the “Spirit of Elijah” or the seed of genealogy was, <span id="page-298"></span> if not planted, at least caused to sprout and grow in the mind and heart of Else K. Christensen. Her beloved parents and her ancient kinsmen in an eternal prison - could it be? Was it her destiny to free them? Such thoughts may have been mingled with her thinking as she was seized with a feeling of the necessity of her searching out the records of her dead ancestors, and from that day she began to plan for it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were no stores or businesses in Christenburg, or any “meeting house” - just stretches of farms, orchards and meadows, with a few farm dwellings and barns, etc., with the Sanpitch River winding its way between. The Christensens, Larsens, and the few other families there, were obliged to travel to Gunnison to attend religious services. When their elders went along they usually rode, but otherwise the children walked back and forth to Sunday schools, Primaries, and Religion classes, each wearing his or her only good pair of shoes, thus called Sunday shoes. It was here in Christenburg that the older Christensen children learned early in life the value of work, thrift and industry. Here they learned to appreciate nature and developed a love for the out-of-doors and the “good earth”. It was here also that the older boys became acquainted with the man from whom their father leased his farm, the well-to-do land owner and sheepman Julius H. Christensen, and he acquainted with them to the satisfactory point, at least, that this gentleman came to think enough of them to hire them to work for him, one after the other for many years, beginning with the oldest, Chris.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs Christensen and Ole H. Larsen often freighted together during this period, and later on as well. Though the danger from outlaws and robbers was not then as great as in earlier times it was still a threat and thus considered safest for freighters to travel in groups, and so they did. There was safety in numbers in case of sickness or injuries, runaways or broken wagons, as well as highwaymen. It was extremely dangerous to carry money. Pay for freighted produce was as a rule sent home by mail. Grain, flour, meat and <span id="page-299"></span> poultry, fruit and garden products were hauled to the mines in Utah and Nevada; anything that would sell, in fact, was taken there to sell, often for gold. Many farmers made trips after their crops had been harvested or at other times when the farm work could be managed by the women and children. Taking care of their animals, preparing food and entertaining each with tales of Indians and the olden days around the campfire, relieved the monotony of these long hard trips.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else’s eleventh and last child was born in the new rock house in northwest Gunnison at nine o’clock on a Sunday night, 27 March 1887. She was blessed in the home 7 April and given the name Elevena, after the Danish way of naming; viz - if the eleventh child happened to be a girl she was given the name Elevena; if the eighth child happened to be a boy, he was named Otto, etc. Later the spelling was simplified to Elvena but almost from the first she was called “Vena” by everyone except her mother. Though not mentioned in Else’s journal, this home naming was probably done by Elvena’s grandfather, Christen Christensen, since he was usually called for such a service if available. The child’s official blessing and naming at church, however, was not taken care of for nearly two years and nine months following her birth, or 23 Dec. 1889, and it was done then by Gunnison’s Bishop Christian August Madsen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Christen Christensen’s seventieth birthday, 29 July that year of 1887, all of his living descendants got together and held a celebration in his honor at his home in east Gunnison. He turned handsprings to show all present what he could do at his age; none others there could do what he did. He had a lively disposition and was a good mixer. He loved to dance and did very well at it. But most of all he was a fine storyteller, and folks always gathered round to hear the tales he told, especially the young people. He was an excellent letter writer and a fine penman besides. He always wrote to his folks in Denmark once a year, and on these occasions he related to them <span id="page-300"></span> everything of interest that had transpired during the past year. He had an excellent memory. He had his wife Anne take notes for him as the year progressed, and when he was ready to make his yearly report he would take these notes and go into a room by himself and write his letter. This would take him many days - but when the letter was finished it was worth it. Anne would read it through aloud and the children always tried to be around to enjoy the contents before it was mailed off to Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christen Christensen at seventy was still a very proud man, although the vicissitudes of life had mellowed him some. He had lost most of what he had when he left the United Order, and though a farmer and stockraiser by trade, and a very good one, he had taken up the job of delivering salt to the people of the county to get a little ready cash to help re-establish himself. He got the salt from the salt bluffs about two miles west of Axtell. This placer salt-bearing mine embraced about 40 acres in that locality. In the earliest days of settlement each family had obtained and refined its own salt, but later it became quite an object of barter and many necessities were obtained through this traffic. The price of rock salt in 1884 was $2.00 per ton, delivered, but naturally it became more expensive as people prospered. The many tons of rock salt hauled to the silver mines in Utah, Idaho and Nevada were of some consideration to the economy of the people who dug it out and hauled it. Christen hauled rock salt at first and he became quite a well-known figure throughout Gunnison Valley, seated erect in his little “salt-cart” driving through, stopping at farmhouses and dwellings along his route to deliver his commodity. Later several boileries were established in the valley, with capacities to turn out 400 tons of fine salt yearly. Lars Myrup had one of these out in Centerfield where he made and sold table salt. He had several working for him. They would take a wagon and drive out to Redmond (west of Axtell) and get the rock salt, return with it to Centerfield and put it in a large vat or boiler, filled with boiling water, where it would be dissolved. When the salt had all crystalized in the bottom and the dross had <span id="page-301"></span> been drained off, the salt crystals were dried out, ground and sold. It was quite possible that Christen worked for his son-in-law, Lars Myrup, selling the refined salt; for he kept up both farming and delivering salt as long as he was able. Be that as it may, one’s eyes grow moist thinking of this once proud Danish gentleman whom some had called “the great man of the north”, who once drove his own fine team and carriage as a well-to-do farmer in Old Denmark, peddling salt in Zion in an old one-horse cart.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A nice thing happened to this fine old man about this time. The three Hansen orphans, whom he had long sought to find, found him! In some way they had learned that Christen was the one who had paid their passage, and that of their dead parents, to Zion more than twenty years before. They located his whereabouts and came to pay him back for this noble service. They were some of the very few who ever reimbursed him for the financial help he had given them in getting to America. He never worried about this and often stated that it was a blessing to use one’s means in such a worthy cause. But this money he did receive came in handy in his old age. He desired to show his appreciation, and since these people had no records of their births in Denmark and other genealogical data and had longed so much to have this information, he sent back to the Old Country and obtained many of these records for them, for which they were most thankful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was so much contagion in the Valley in those early years. Diphtheria had been rampant in Gunnison in November of 1879, at which time six of the brethren had been appointed as a board of health to guard against the dread disease. Schools were closed for a time until it was considered safe to recommence. Again in 1884 this same disease had caused the people there “to be diligent in the practice of sanitary rules”. Meetings then were not discontinued but it was “considered wisdom to leave the children home.” In the fall of the year 1887 an epidemic of diphtheria swept over the whole of Gunnison Valley. Many people contracted this highly contagious disease. <span id="page-302"></span> Sore feverish throats were swabbed with alcohol and blue vitriol in an effort to combat the dread bacillus. Most all homes were visited by death. Fatality among the children was exceedingly great, sometimes three or four from a family. Some adults also fell prey to this fearful malady. In North Mayfield, during one of these epidemics, five of the seven children of Simon and Martha Hansen (she who had been the first teacher in the United Order there) died of diphtheria within one week. Three of them were buried in the same grave. In Gunnison, children of the Ole H. and Inger Hansen family, who had recently moved from Christenburg, into a lovely new winter home there, contracted this ravaging sickness and two of them, Peter and Hanner, died of it that year. Mixed feelings of fear and compassion filled the hearts of the people as diphtheria spread from home to home. The red flag of warning on so many gate posts, all too often became a symbol of death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else K. Christensen was on the go during that dreadful time. History has failed to record the extent of her efforts, to this point, but merely noted:— “Mrs. Elsie (Else) Christensen is said to have had ‘great success’ and Parlan McFarlane, although not a doctor, was quite successful in treating the disease.” It has often been quoted that “Fools rush in where angels fear to tread”. In the case of the doctress Else K. this could be applied a little differently; for here was one home-spun angel of mercy who pushed resolutely forward into many stricken homes where most others feared to go - saving a life here - giving hope and comfort there - and leaving her benediction of service and love wherever she went. Did she fear for her life and those of her own children? Of course she did! But she knew it was her duty and her destiny to become involved, come what might. She must have had great dedication and courage and still greater faith. That none of her own family were afflicted at this time seemed proof of the approbation of the kind Heavenly Father to whom she so often and fervently prayed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whether it was for some contagion, sore affliction, pestering complaint, or for the <span id="page-303"></span> important work of bringing babies she was summoned, Else K. Christensen was almost always well prepared. Sometimes she gathered and made concoctions from smartweed, wormwood, horehound, yarrow and other herbs which grew wild in the valley. She often used catnip, peppermint and sage tea in her treatments. She was a specialist with hot packs and mustard plasters. Among the medical helps which she used freely and with great skill were, besides the previously mentioned “blood-letting knife”, a variety of lances for boils and a suction cup to draw the pus out. She kept all her tools very sharp and in the best of condition, safe in her medical kit, ready for use at any and all times. To the Christensen children Else’s brown satchel was a “mustn’t touch it”. To them it held “magic things” with which their mother treated the sick and the afflicted. It sometimes held her medical journal as well, in which were written the recipes for “magic cures”, together with a list of the babies she had brought and other data pertaining to her profession.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just about spring the next year Else made the following entry in her journal;— ‘Victor Madsen en datter den 14 March 1888.” This simple statement in no way indicated the part the birth of this baby girl was to play in the lives of Laurs and Else Christensen and their family. Ada Lorena Madsen, for so the infant was later named, was the fifth child of Victor August Hastrup Madsen (adopted son of Bishop Christian August Madsen) and his wife Sarah Olesen Madsen. Else worked hard to save the life of this little child and as she worked she prayed, for some malfunctioning of her heart was evident from the start. With special care some progress was made in the little one’s condition throughout the weeks following her birth, but the mother, Sarah, failed to gain back her health and strength after the ordeal. Else spared nothing in her efforts to get Sister Madsen back on her feet again, but to no avail. It was apparent that the young mother could not get well. In despair Sarah Madsen called Else Christensen to her bedside and tearfully pled with her to take her baby Ada to care for and raise when she was gone. Who could have denied the last request of this <span id="page-304"></span> dying mother? Not Else!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sarah Madsen passed away Friday 25 May 1888, less than two months before her twenty-eighth birthday. She was buried a few days later in the Gunnison cemetery beside another baby daughter, Almira, who had died at two years. With the full consent of the bereaved husband, Else took the two month eleven day old Ada Lorena Madsen into her home and cared for the motherless little girl as if she were her own. We have been told that little Ada, though frail and sickly, was very bright and of a very sweet nature and that the nine Christensen children, as well as Laurs and Else, took her to their hearts. This was especially true of one year old Elvena, who adored Ada, and the feeling seemed to be mutual between them. They played by the hour together and Else even dressed them alike when she could. People often thought the two little girls were twins, although Elvena had very blonde curls while Ada’s were very dark. Ada was not officially adopted by the Christensens, yet she was much loved by them and treated as their very own. No strings were attached to her by the Madsen family. Her natural father gave her foster parents this written statement:— “I hereby give my consent for my daughter, Ada Lorena Madsen, to be called by the name of the people who raise her. - Victor A. Madsen.” So they changed the small girl’s name to Ada Christensen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For a little more than eleven years the people of the Church, but more particularly the Saints in Sanpete Valley, had awaited with great anticipation the completion of the immense and beautiful building that was being erected. On a hill of solid stone jutting west into the valley from the rugged Wasatch Mountains east of the city of Manti, the magnificent structure had grown until now it stood in all its glory on the crest of “Temple Hill”, its delicate towers patterned against the sky. It appeared like a glittering jewel on the bosom of the mountain range. Built of oolitic stone of a warm cream or ivory color, which had been quarried from these same mountains, it commanded <span id="page-305"></span> a superb view of the country round about, north, south and west. It was impossible to imagine a more eminent location for a temple and one affording greater opportunity for artistic and delightful surroundings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The building itself was 171 feet 6 inches long, 92 feet wide, and 79 feet high to the square, plus the two towers reaching heavenward, the one on the east 169 feet. These were thirty feet square at the base but tapered upward. The walls of the main building were 3 feet 6 inches thick at the base, with 4-foot buttresses, diminishing to 3 feet at the square and the buttresses to about 2 feet 6 inches. The building itself, as well as the towers, had ample window facilities. Adjoining the structure on the north was a heating plant and annex. The grounds were terraced and planted with vines, shrubs, trees and flowers. The public highway ran past the temple from which the ascent to the ground floor was over thirty feet, but a sloping drive beginning at the north, passing under part ofthe east edge of the building and finding an outlet on the south, made the ascent easy. Two lengthy flights of steps led up to the temple, a great wide one of cement on the west and a narrow one on the far south just east of the driveway.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The interior of the temple matched the exterior in beauty and workmanship in every degree, perhaps one of the most distinctive features being the two spiral stairways of choicest wood which had been so intricately balanced as to need no center support at all. The height of each of these was 95 feet from floor to ceiling and they contained 150 steps apiece. There were only five such unusual stairways in the United States, including the two in this temple. (Even today there are only five in the U. S. A. and no other temple has the likes of these.) Overall, the Manti temple had been a gigantic undertaking and at the time was the finest structure yet to be erected in the Rocky Mountains, although it was the third temple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Out of the hearts, out of the foodstuffs, out of the labors and sacrifices of these people this temple had been built. A Sunday egg here, a <span id="page-306"></span> young calf there, a bushel of wheat gleaned by a widow - it had all added up over the years to the one million dollars that had been required to build it. Now at last it was completed and the hearts of the people were bursting with feelings of thanksgiving as the day of its dedication drew near. A three day celebration had been planned and one can be sure every adult member in the valley who was physically able, and could secure a recommend from his or her Bishop, would attend one or more of the inspirational meetings. Numbers of the authorities from Salt Lake City were expected, as well as caravans of church leaders traveling in from other parts of the Territory. Whereas at the time of the dedication of the site eleven years before (25 Apr. 1877) valley Saints had mostly come to Manti in slow moving ox-drawn wagons, now they would be able to come and go with faster teams and rigs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Monday, 21 May 1888, the Manti Temple was dedicated by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. The large assembly room, seating about 1,500, was filled to overflowing. Men of the Priesthood were seated on the right, the women on the left, as was the case in all church meetings even well into the nineteenth century. A regional choir had been practicing for months for this occasion, under the baton of Professor Smyth. “On the first day of the religious gatherings in the temple, just as Professor Smyth was concluding the voluntary - a selection from Mendelssohn - a number of the Saints in the body of the hall and some of the brethren in the west stand heard most heavenly voices singing. It sounded to them as angelic, and appeared to be behind and above them, and many turned their heads in that direction wondering if there were not another choir in some other part of the building. There was no other visible choir however… Some of the Saints saw the spirits of Presidents Young and Taylor, J. M. Grant, and others, in the temple, and the heads of some of the speakers were surrounded by a halo of heavenly light during the services. The Saints enjoyed a spiritual feast extending through the three days, and many shed tears of joy while listening to the testimonies and admonitions of the servants of God. <span id="page-307"></span> There can be no question but that God has accepted the Manti temple at the hands of his Saints and will bless all who have in any degree assisted to build it or who, not having the means to assist, have said in their hearts, “I would have helped if I could.” (This quote was taken from The Millennial Star, Vol. 50, No. 26, p. 405.) Perhaps some said then, doubting, as some may say now, “Seeing’s believing” - but did not Christ say, “one must believe to see!”?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is hard to think other than that the Christensens and their relatives from Gunnison were present at the dedication of the Manti Temple, Christen, Anne, Pauline, Lars Myrup, Laurs and even Else must have been in attendance, though it took place just four days before the death of Else’s patient, the mother Sarah Madsen. Possibly they were among those who heard the invisible choir, or saw heavenly beings seated among them. Less than six months later most of the above took advantage of the marvelous opportunity and entered that magnificent edifice again, this time to do work in behalf of some of their departed loved ones. The “Spirit of Elijah” rested upon them and the importance of “work for the dead” was made manifest unto them. There was no excuse for them to neglect this work now that they had a temple near at hand; if they did, they did it “at the peril of their own salvation”, as the prophets had said. In speaking of these things during the dedication of the St. George Temple, Brigham Young had stated:— “Those who can see the spiritual atmosphere can see that many are still glued to the earth. They are lusting and longing for the things of the earth, in which there is no profit. While we ought to look after temporal things, we should devote them all to the kingdom of God. Where are the hearts of the people; where are their forefathers? What are they doing for their own salvation and for that of their forefathers? … If we were awake to this great truth this house would be crowded from Monday morning until Saturday night… This temple has been built that people can come and labor for their salvation and that of their progenitors… What do you suppose the fathers would say if they could speak <span id="page-308"></span> from the dead? Would they not say: ‘We have lain here thousands of years in the prison house, bound and fettered in the association of the filthy and corrupt.’ If they had the power the very thunders of heaven would resound in our ears. All the angels of heaven are looking to this little handful of people. When I think upon the subject I want the tongues of seven thunders to awaken the people to action.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Monday, 12 Nov. 1888, Christen Christensen and a number of his family made their way from Gunnison to Manti by wagon and set up camp on the grounds provided for that purpose just southwest of the temple grounds. The next day Laurs, Pauline, Anne and Christen himself went into the beautiful temple and were baptized for dozens of their dead kindred. For four days they labored in this sacred building for their deceased relatives - brothers, sisters, parents, grandparents - all were baptized, endowed and sealed under the hands of the holy priesthood. They did not forget to do the endowments for the gentle Karen and the daughter Petrine, or for Karen’s parents and relatives who were dead, for Christen had procured the records of them by correspondence with her people. On Nov. 14, 1888 they had the joy of fulfilling one of their most sacred dreams, that of being sealed together as a family for time and all eternity. Christen’s two daughters, Nielsine, or Sena, and Caroline came into the temple that day for this occasion. Caroline, the only one of Christen’s and Anne’s children not born in the covenant was sealed to them there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Christen’s and Karen’s children, both the living and the dead, were sealed to them - all but the first son, Christen, who was still living in far-off Denmark, apparently with no interest whatsoever in the purposes of the Most High. Christen Sr. stood for himself in this last sealing, as in the first, while Laurs, Pauline and Sena not only stood for themselves but also alternated for their dead brothers and sisters, Peter C., Niels C., Maren, Ane Marie and the two Petrines. Anne stood for the gentle Karen and Daniel H. Wells, first President of the Manti Temple, performed the sealings.<sup id="fnref:7" class="calibre11"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:7">7</a></sup> Sena herself had risen from a bed of sorrow to come to the Temple that November day. Exactly two weeks before she had laid away a five weeks old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In those early days the Saints did the work for their own dead, or hired it done by other Saints. Christen and Anne were most faithful in their genealogical responsibilities. They wrote often to the Old Country for records of their departed kin and friends and went to the temple regularly to act as proxies in their behalf. According to their daughter Caroline, the practice of going to the Manti temple continued with her parents as long as her elderly father was able, for she wrote:— “He was not only kind and considerate of the living but did what he could for the dead. He and mother went from Gunnison to Manti by team many a Tuesday and came back Saturday. They took their provisions with them and camped, doing temple work for their dead kindred and friends. They did this for many weeks and years, when father was not busy in the fields, farming.” The Manti temple records show that Christen and Anne Christensen worked consistently in that sacred building for the next nine years, accomplishing a great amount of vicarious work for their dead.</p>
