  <p class="calibre1">(28) Rex Christensen (7) was born 10 Mar. 1906 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the old Wasden home across south from the home of his Christensen grandparents. When he was seven days old his parents thought he was dying. They called the Elders in to give him a name and a blessing and he recovered, but that is the reason, his mother said, that he had only one given name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When he was yet very young the family moved to a ranch a mile or so west of Gunnison into a rather poorly equipped farm house there. The ranch belonged to his father’s brother Albert. Rex was indeed a sickly baby and had some very severe spells when he would hemorrhage from the nose. His father was often away with the sheep. His sister LaFaun says that their mother, often alone on the ranch except for her three small children, pulled baby Rex through a number of bad sick spells with her faith and prayers. She <span id="page-799"></span> remembers how her mother knelt by his cradle to pray and how she rocked him in her arms hour after hour in the rocking chair to soothe him singing a plaintive lullaby. Many mothers had a hard time raising all their children to maturity in those days. Rex’s little brother Spencer, who came along right after him, only lived a few weeks.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not long before Rex turned three, his father bought his grandparents’ big rock house, across from where he was born in northwest Gunnison, and moved the family into it. It was here that he lived the next seven years of his life. It was from here that he went to the Gunnison district school for several years - it was but a few blocks from this home. It was from here that he left Gunnison when he was just six days past ten, together with others of his family, to go to Wyoming and live on a ranch his father had homesteaded, being part of the acreage taken up by several members of his father’s family several miles from the town of Lyman and which they called “The Oasis”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rex eventually grew to be a strong, strapping and very handsome fellow. In 1929 in Ogden, Utah, he married Marcella Richardson, daughter of Walter and Stella Richardson. They had one son but separated when the child was about two years old. Rex married second, 29 Nov. 1932 in Lyman, Wyoming, Ina Mae Packham (b. 23 Aug. 1903 in Pleasant View, Utah, to John and Lydia Kent Packham). They had two daughters. Ina died of a serious illness 10 Mar. 1942 in Ogden, leaving Rex with the two little girls. On 27 Oct. 1943 in Ogden, Rex married his third wife, Mabel Patterson (b. 23 Jan. 1924 in Ogden to David Earl and Dora Miller Patterson). They became the parents of two sons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For many of his last years he suffered with emphysema, a malfunction or disease of the lungs and reported to be the fastest growing disease in the world today. He was unable to do any heavy work. Mabel, a very lovely, kind and patient person, took care of him and also went to work to support the family. Rex passed away at their home in Ogden 29 Sep. 1968 and was buried in Ogden Cemetery 2 Oct. His wife and five children survived <span id="page-800"></span> him, as well as a number of grandchildren and brothers and sisters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mabel has written of him and we quote:- “Rex had brown hair, brown eyes, a fair complexion and an even temper. I found him very easy to get along with. Everyone he met seemed to like him right away. As a man he had very good health up until the last dozen years when he developed emphysema. He was an avid fisherman. I have seen him catch fish when others around him couldn’t even get a bite. He loved the outdoors and said he felt a closeness to his Creator when on a stream or in the hills. He recalled many summers of hard work on the ranch in Wyoming with his father and brother Lucien. He attended school both in Lyman and Evanston, Wyoming. He was a boxer in his high school years and at one time won the Golden Glove tournament in his area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Rex was just past nineteen he was called to serve a mission for the church in New Zealand. He had his endowment 2 Apr. 1925 and left the mission home shortly afterwards, traveling by train to Vancouver, Canada and then by boat from there. He returned by boat to San Francisco in 1928, the boat trip having taken nineteen days each way. While on his mission he had appendicitis and later on pneumonia. He said only the faith of the Elders and the grace of God saved his life on those occasions. He loved the time he spent on his mission and he loved the Maori people. Occasionally he commented on how eager these people were to help the Elders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Once at a Conference there President McKay, then an Apostle, was in attendance. Afterwards, outside, there was an intoxicated man who was angry with the Mormons for some reason or another. All worked up in his anger, he approached Brother McKay and challenged him to a fight. He raised his fists to strike the great Apostle who stood there calmly, saying not a word but just looking at him in pity with those piercing eyes of his. As suddenly as he had raised his fists, the enraged man fell to his knees sobbing and asking forgiveness. Rex said this incident helped to increase the testimonies of the other people who were present - and also his own. <span id="page-801"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Rex had lived in Ogden ever since he returned from his mission in New Zealand in 1928, except for one year in The Dalles, Oregon, where his second wife, Ina, became ill with a brain tumor and they returned to Ogden to be near her family, and the six months he and I and the family lived in Redlands, Calif, in 1950.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He was a good husband and father. A couple of years before his death we attended ‘Project Temple’ together and on June 22, 1967 he took me and our sons to the Logan Temple to be sealed to him for all eternity. Though we miss him so much we realize he is better off where he is. I am now interested in getting his genealogy together, as well as my own.”</p>
