  <p class="calibre1">(27) Myron Ellis Christensen (3) was born Sun. 4 Mar. 1906 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the family home in the west part of town, which is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-795" title="795"></span> still standing today. He was christened Ellis Myron but later changed his name to the above arrangement. His only brother then living, Harold, was ten years older than he, so his closest companion in the home was his sister Ruth Ellen, some three-and-a-half years older; they have been great friends ever since.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When he was in his teens his parents moved from the home of his birth to a farm they owned near Rocky Point, west of Gunnison, where he helped his father feed lambs and with the farm work. He attended grade and high school in Gunnison, graduating from the latter. It was a long walk from Rocky Point to school and seemed especially so in the cold of the winter. But in spite of it, or perhaps a little because of it, Myron grew to be a tall, strong, healthy youth capable of a lot of hard work. He received excellent training in farm and livestock management from his father and set his heart on acquiring a good farm of his own someday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His father died in the small farm house near Rocky Point, 23 July 1926, when Myron was four months past twenty, leaving him as his mother’s main source of help and strength. Harold and Ruth had long since married and made their own homes. His three younger brothers, one nineteen and the others going on fifteen and ten, were a lot of help, especially the two oldest who had undergone a lot of farm training and were also big fellows and capable,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Myron at the time was courting. One evening at a roller skating rink in Manti, Utah (Felts Pavillion), about four years before he had met a Manti girl named Delida Jensen (b. 23 June 1907 in Sterling, Utah to William and Maria Louella Peterson Jensen). A friendship had begun that night which had lasted those several years, during which time Myron had made hundreds of trips to Manti in all kinds of weather. Nearly nine months after his father’s death, Myron and Delida (“Dee”) contracted a civil marriage in Manti, 13 Apr. 1927. Myron’s mother and three brothers soon moved to Fayette, Utah to live with her recently widowed brother, Uncle Henry Bartholomew, and assist in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-796" title="796"></span> caring for his motherless children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dee takes up the story from here:— “Myron and I took up farming in Clarion, Utah (near Gunnison) and farmed there until Delta City took the water rights away. After leaving Clarion we moved to Gunnison for awhile and then we got the opportunity to come to Genola, Utah to work for G. H. Chaffin on his ranch. This was during the severe depression of the 30’s. Myron worked on the Chaffin ranch for ten years and then bought a farm of his own in the Genola area where our family still lives. We have five living children and one died at birth. The five are all married now and have children of their own, so Myron and I live on the farm alone and still work hard. But we travel quite a lot in our car and always go on at least one big trip each year, most usually in late fall or winter when the farm work can be left alone for awhile. We have been to the Northwest, Mexico, and numerous times to California where we almost always drop in on Ruth Ellen and her family in San Diego. This winter we took Myron’s brother Marvin and his wife Lois with us to Ruth Ellen’s. We enjoyed ourselves there. The last trip his brother Harold took before he died was with us to San Diego. We love to travel. We go fishing a lot too, for Myron loves to fish.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The winter of 1967 was a hectic one for us. My mother passed away and Myron was laid up with the gout in his foot. This was pretty tough for a farmer. Then our son’s year old boy was in the hospital with spinal meningitis and was very sick, though he finally responded to the medication. Grandma Dee had the four year old to care for during his baby brother’s illness. Generally we have good health and should not complain, but we too are getting old like the rest of you. But we enjoy life a lot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“While in Goshen, Myron has been a member and one time president of the White Lake Riding Club. He was also employed by the Strawberry Highline Canal Co. here for eleven years. At present, besides operating his own farm, he is employed on the large church farm at Elberta, Utah, not far from our place, and has been for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-797" title="797"></span> several years. Looking forward to retirement, Myron just sold part of his farm and bought himself a boat so he can go fishing in style.”</p>
