  <p class="calibre1">(20) Byron Charles Peterson (6) was born Wed. 27 July 1904 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. His grandmother Christensen was in attendance at the birth. There was a small earthquake in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-756" title="756"></span> area that day and when the house began to shake she thought his father had run into it with the wagon. There was some damage done by the quake. On their place the old well sunk and the city ditch broke, a neighbor’s shed caught fire and burned and the Richfield Tabernacle in Sevier County cracked.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron was quite badly tongue-tied as a child and couldn’t talk plain. Even after several clippings off and on, by Dr. Hagen, he still had some trouble. In fact he says that even today he has trouble with his W’s, though we’ve never noticed it. He was also a rather determined child, but whether he got that from his Danish or his Swedish ancestors we cannot say. He sometimes took his ill-temper out on his father’s pigs, of which there were usually over a hundred. He would throw rocks at them or hit them with sticks to make them squeal. He remembers that they used to squeal real loud whenever grandmother Christensen came on a visit and she would say, “those poor pigs are hungry” and go out and throw them some extra handfuls of grain. She had a soft spot in her heart for pigs and they always seemed to know when she was around and took advantage of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron was baptized in the Manti Temple a few weeks after he turned eight, 20 Aug. 1912. His mother took him there. There was another boy from Gunnison there with his mother for the same purpose, and after he was baptized he broke away from his baptizer and took a good swim in the font before they captured him and brought him out for confirmation. This boy’s mother was so embarrassed she hardly ever got over it. Byron decided that if he ever got another chance at baptism he would do the same thing - but he never got another chance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was about eight when he started helping his father on the farm. About his first job was raking hay. He loved the farm and turned out to be a farmer and cattle raiser for much of his life. He says he was somewhat of a runt when he was a boy but that when he started to grow it seemed the sky was the limit. He grew to be a tall, big fellow with a big heart. School to him in his early years <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-757" title="757"></span> seemed an unnecessary encumbrance, though he put up with it. In the fifth grade he had whooping cough real bad and was out part of the year. He says it took him nine years to get out of the first eight grades and he was lucky at that. His cousin Melrose, a year younger, was in his same class the last few years and was “pretty smart”. Byron attended first year High School and a good part of Second in the old Gunnison High School building and then one day in early spring of that second year, a few weeks before they were to move into the new high school building, he had an argument with one of his teachers, an old maid. She insisted that he make up some back work and he said he wouldn’t do it and quit school then and there - anyway he was needed by his father for spring planting. He never went back to school and from that time on carried a full load on the farm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron remembers attending Sunday School and Sacrament meetings, and later MIA, but never Primary. He didn’t like Primary. His mother was very active in the church, as were his two younger sisters. His father was active also, as far as his work would permit, and became Bishop of the Hamilton Ward. Sometime after his mother’s death in 1927 he was approached by the man who was then his Bishop, in a more or less casual manner, about serving a mission for the church. Byron made it known that he was not interested. He was keeping company with a girl he liked and contemplating marriage, although she didn’t know it. After a time they broke up. Then 11 Dec. 1929 his father married a widow with three children who lived in Redmond. This disturbed Byron a great deal also. He wasn’t long after that getting word to the right parties that he wanted to serve a mission.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was called to go to South Africa, one of the most distant missions of the church. After he and his father had visited around in Gunnison, Goshen, Provo and Salt Lake with various relatives, he entered the Mission Home in Salt Lake City 10 Mar. 1930. He was going on twenty-six years of age. He was set apart for his mission by Richard R. Lyman and left by train for Chicago 20 Mar. at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-758" title="758"></span> 12:35 p.m. The group of outgoing missionaries stopped over at Chicago and visited points of interest and also stopped to see Niagara Falls enroute. Arriving in New York City they spent a day seeing the sights and sailed next day on the “American Farmer” ship for England, docking nine days later, 3 Apr. 1930 at Plymouth, where they were welcomed by President Lund. They spent six days viewing the sights of London and surrounding areas. Then those going to South Africa left Southampton, England on board the German ship “Adolph Werman” 9 Apr. They arrived in Capetown, South Africa 1 May 1930.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron spent sixteen months laboring in the Capetown area. On 21 July 1930 in the nearby town of Woodstock he met an investigator, Johanna Gregg Fourie, and her husband and children who were then members of the Dutch Reformed Church. Several years later Mrs. Fourie and most of her children joined the LDS church and she credits Elder Byron Peterson as having had a great deal to do with their conversions. The youngest Fourie child, a daughter Felicia, who was five years old when Byron met the family, later came to Utah and married his cousin’s son, the oldest child of Virginia C. and Daniel M. Keeler. Mr. Fourie joined the church many years after his wife and came with her to Utah in 1952 to see Felicia and her family. Here they were permitted to go to the Salt Lake Temple for their endowments and sealing, having Felicia sealed to them also. They visited Byron and his family in Gunnison and Mrs. Fourie spoke in their Ward and told Byron’s part in converting her family. He was the third LDS Elder she ever met. (Mrs. Fourie, now eighty, has been head of the Primary in South Africa since the day after her baptism, some more than thirty-four years ago. She was recently honored with a write-up-and picture in the Church Section of the Deseret News.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Following his time spent in Capetown, Byron served another year in East London, South Africa, his missionary service being twenty-eight months in all, not counting traveling time. He left Capetown 9 Sep. 1932; arrived in Southampton, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-759" title="759"></span> England 26 Sep. and left there 28 Sep., docked at New York City 4 Oct. 1932 and got in Salt Lake City 8 Oct. General Conference was in session there and he was met by his sister Ada and her husband Lin. When he returned to Gunnison he had been away from home a few days more than thirty-one months. He was then twenty-eight years and three months old. His mother, of course, was gone from the home; his father spent most of his spare time with his second wife at her home in nearby Redmond. Ada and her husband had moved to Delta, Utah; the country was in the midst of the great depression of the 30’s and the Peterson ranch looked pretty well run down because of it, and he and his sister Imelda were pretty much alone. After looking over this gloomy situation, Byron said he sat down and wept half the night. Similar fits of discouragement strike numbers of missionaries upon returning home from successful, wonderful missions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Byron soon threw himself into the work on the farm, along with his father. He also became very active in the Ward, especially in the MIA. He loved to dance and never missed an opportunity to attend a church dance or social. Being an eligible bachelor he was undoubtedly much sought after as a partner. He had always liked girls and felt at home with them, having been raised with sisters. And though he may not have admitted it, he was looking around for a wife. This went on for some three years following his return from his mission.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In August of 1935 a very special event, long in preparation and well developed, was to be held on Temple Hill in Manti. A religious pageant with choruses and trumpeters was to be presented directly east of the temple, during which time flood lights were to be turned on, illuminating for the first time the outside of the beautiful temple in all its glory. All the people of Sanpete Valley and the temple district were invited and guests were expected from all over the state. Byron had arranged to take six widows from the Ward in Gunnison with him in his car to Manti the evening of the presentation, They were driving <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-760" title="760"></span> along main street in Manti when he caught sight of a Manti girl he knew walking along with another girl towards the temple. Always friendly, he slowed down and called to the girls, “I’ll be back to pick you up.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Depositing his load of widows at the temple gate he drove his car back and picked up the two girls, being immediately introduced to Mildred Olsen, a girl from Manti who was working as a practical nurse in Salt Lake City but who had returned especially for the pageant. (Her boy friend was ushering at the west gate and couldn’t escort her to the affair but planned to walk her home after - though she didn’t tell Byron Peterson that.) Taking his car seat from the car, Byron invited Mildred to share it with him sitting on the temple lawn, which she did. They spent a wonderful evening there. Mildred, writing of it later, had this to say:— “What a glorious sight to behold - the inspiring pageant - the magnificent temple flooded in light - a throng of thousands of people seated on lawns, walks and hill. Even old Mother Nature added her blessing by furnishing a total eclipse of the moon at a very dramatic moment, plainly visable to all, which greatly enhanced the scene of unusual splendor.” It would have been a wonderful night to fall in love and perhaps the two did, though they may not have known it then - for Cupid is a sly one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron went back to Gunnison afterwards with his load of widows and Mildred strolled home with her boy friend. Returning to Salt Lake she found it hard to forget the evening and Byron Peterson. She dropped him a card at Christmastime, mentioning how much she had enjoyed that August evening and discreetly jotting down her Salt Lake address in small letters in one corner. Byron took the bait right away and began driving up to Salt Lake to see her. The trouble was, however, that he seldom made appointments. He was as apt as not to leave Gunnison after work with one of his Peterson cousins and a load of pigs to deliver. He seldom found her home since she would be out on various cases. One time, learning that a Gold and Green Ball was to be held in her Salt Lake Ward, he came all dressed up <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-761" title="761"></span> to take her to it, without any notification, but found her tied with a patient she could not leave. Another time when he called in to see her she had been left to care for three little children, in the absence of their parents. They attended an afternoon movie, taking the children with them. They really had quite a difficult time getting together - but it was thus they courted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron Charles Peterson and Mildred Elizabeth Olsen were married 22 July 1936 in the Manti Temple, five days before his thirty-second birthday. She was twenty-nine and a half (b. 1 Jan. 1907, Ferron, Utah to Andrew Christian and Hannah Elizabeth Hansen Olsen). Both Mildred’s parents were dead but she owned the family home in Manti, which she sold. Byron took her home to live on the farm in Gunnison. There wasn’t much of a celebration but his father suggested that the family take a little trip over the Twenty-Fourth, so father Charles, Ada and Lin, Imelda, Byron and Mildred, went to Ferron Reservoir fishing for three days - and that is how they spent their honeymoon.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron served as President of the Ward YMMIA and then was put in as First Counselor to the Bishop of the Hamilton Ward. He was later placed on the Stake High Council and was active on the Genealogical committee. Mildred was as active in church as she could be with a farm household to manage and raising her family. She was a hard worker. They had five children in a little over eight years, during which time Byron’s father’s second wife died of a brain cancer and he returned to live with them in the home. Charles was married again, however, on 14 May 1945 to another widow and went to live at her home elsewhere in Gunnison about two months before Mildred’s fifth baby was born. The farm and cattle were doing well and furnishing them with a good living and things looked bright ahead.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two months after this Byron came down with a severe sore throat and grumped around the house for several days. It seemed he had an ordinary cold, but though he spent a great deal of time on the bed he couldn’t rest. The morning <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-762" title="762"></span> of 15 Sep. 1945 he arose from the bed and made his way unsteadily towards the kitchen where Mildred was finishing up the children’s breakfast chores, preparatory to fixing him a good breakfast, for he had said he was famished. She turned to look at him as he reached the door - he looked terrible. Suddenly he seemed to stiffen and clutched at the doorframe; he could not take another step. She helped him onto a stool then phoned the doctor.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After the diagnosis and the prescribing of several sets of pills, the doctor left the house. Mildred followed him outside. “What is it Doctor?” she said. He said he couldn’t be certain but that if her husband went unconscious in a short time she’d know he had polio. Byron went unconscious alright, and the next day (16 Sept.) was rushed to the General Hospital in Salt Lake City where he remained unconscious for three weeks while his life hung in the balance. He lived, but his right hand and arm were stricken - and his legs - his poor pain-filled legs. It was three months before he could sit up. Eight months of therapy and hospital care brought back the life and strength to his hand and arm - but his legs? He never walked again. He was allowed to return home a few days at Christmas and again in early spring for the same length of time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mildred and the children all came down with a mild form of polio to a greater or less degree, but they were not hospitalized. The children soon grew better but Mildred’s trouble was in her spine where she suffered a lot of pain, as she did in her arms and shoulders. She was unable to lift anything but she couldn’t stop with a family to care for. It took her five months to get back to near normal. In the meantime Byron’s father, Charles, passed away suddenly just three weeks after Byron was stricken. Someone made a typed copy of the proceedings at the funeral and this was sent to Byron. It was poor comfort for the loss of a father, on top of everything else, but it was comfort nevertheless and appreciated. We have heard the expression “It never rains but it pours” - how true that must have seemed to the Peterson family at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron was brought home to stay 10 May 1946. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-763" title="763"></span> Five nurses and one doctor from the hospital came with him to give instructions on his care as well as orient the family to the realization of the emotional struggle their father and husband was going to endure getting back into society. The doctor said, “No one in the world can make him walk again and nothing in the world can do more to help him now than the patient understanding and love of his family.” So Mildred rolled up her sleeves and went on with the job of nurse and doctor as well as loving wife and mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron made wonderful progress. Before long he was directing the operation of his farm and livestock, from a truck he learned to drive or a wheelchair. For three years after that, with the help of his son Kent, he hauled water by truck from State Canal to their one thousand acre range at Lone Cedar around Scipio Lake, 11 miles west of Gunnison, to quench the thirst of a hundred and fifty head of cattle for about a month and a half each year, until the cattle found their way to the small lake. They made several trips a day doing this during that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fall of 1947 they bought a duplex in town at 78 East lst South, and rented the farmhouse to others. This made it easier for the children to attend school and for Mildred to do the shopping and other family business. They still reside there today, living in one side of the duplex and renting out the other. A cement ramp from the front cement porch makes it possible for Byron to go and come at will in his wheelchair. He has worn out three of these and now has a fourth one, this with pneumatic tires to make it easier going. He has wheeled himself downtown and to church and local funerals, where the brethren lift him in his wheelchair up and down the steps. He drives his own car to other cities and cemeteries to attend the funerals and burials of relatives and friends. Most of us Christensens have seen him at such places. Memorial Day always finds him at Gunnison Cemetery and then Manti Cemetery, near the graves of departed loved ones, waiting to greet other relatives he knows will come to decorate the graves. He was and is a man who loves his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-764" title="764"></span> family and relatives dearly, one and all. Some have this great spirit of family loyalty, while with others it is almost entirely absent.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron eventually found it necessary to sell out his ranch and cattle interests, first the cattle then the range and lastly the farm, or ranch, of 372 acres. He says one of the saddest days of his life was the day he was forced to part with the ranch - he says he shed enough tears over it to irrigate the place. He has sent both his sons and one daughter on missions and both his sons to college. All his children are doing very well, He and Mildred have raised a fine family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the last three summers Byron has assisted in operating the Tourist Information booth in Gunnison City Park and expects to do the same this summer (1969). It has been a great experience and he is well qualified - both because of his friendliness and interest in people, and his knowledge of the area and its history. We copy from an article in the Deseret News:— “Gunnison, Sanpete County - more than 3,000 persons learned more about tourist attractions in south-central Utah through the tourist information booth operated at the City park during 1967. Officials said a total of 766 vehicles stopped for information. The booth was open for 677 hours and operated by Emil Nielsen, Byron Peterson, and Mrs. Ferdinand Hansen. It was sponsored by the Gunnison Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through the assistance of the Gunnison Businessman’s Association and Sanpete County agencies.” An account of Byron’s experience with visitors there would fill another ten pages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His service at the booth has been interspersed by numerous trips with friends by car, truck or jeep into the outlying areas of the region, but more particularly into the wonderlands of eastern and southern Utah. He is a great traveling companion. He can talk for hours about the beauties of Utah’s highways and byways, mountains, canyons, deserts and streams. Few retain a better knowledge of places they visit than he. It has been twenty-three and a half years now since he stepped foot upon the sod - he who had been more apt to run at his work or play than walk. We have never heard him <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-765" title="765"></span> complain or grumble at his lot, though he must do at times, as Mildred can surely testify. With it all he has retained his great sense of humor, almost bubbling over with it at times. What a lucky man he was to get a helpmate like Mildred.</p>
