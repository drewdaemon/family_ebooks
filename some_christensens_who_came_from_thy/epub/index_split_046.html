  <p class="calibre1">Laurs M. C. and Else K, Christensen had sixty-seven grandchildren. A history of each is included in this part of the book. Fifty-one of them were living when the writing of it was begun; four have passed away since. In order to save space and repetition each grandchild’s name in the beginning will be followed by a number denoting the branch of the family to which he or she belongs; viz: Christian’s (1), Andrew’s (2), Joseph’s (3), etc. Each is listed chronologically, according to the year of birth. Granddaughters appear under their maiden names, and in all instances the original Danish spelling of the surname Christen- sen has been used, although a number may now Spell the name Christenson. It is too confusing to do otherwise. ey</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How fortunate we are to be able to present some of the experiences of these people as told by themselves; for most of those living sent in their own histories which ranged in length from very- short to far-too-lengthy to be published in full here. We are most grateful for each and everyone, how- ever, and delighted to find that our Christensen cousins have about run the gamut of interests and accomplishments in this great panorama of modern</p>
