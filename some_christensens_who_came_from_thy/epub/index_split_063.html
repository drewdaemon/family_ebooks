  <p class="calibre1">(17) Louis Lucien Christensen (7) was born 20 Aug. 1903 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the old Wasden home across the road west and a bit south from the rock house owned by his Christensen grandparents. His grandmother, Else K., likely served as midwife on that occasion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lucien wasn’t much more than a toddler when his family moved a mile or so west of Gunnison to live on a ranch owned by his father’s brother, Albert. <span id="page-741"></span> The skeleton of the small log and lumber farmhouse they lived in then is still standing (1969) on what is now the Ray Taylor ranch. Lucien and his sister LaFaun, two years older, were great pals. There was no one else to play with on the ranch except their baby brother Rex, who was sickly. Sometimes they got lonesome. LaFaun tells about Lucien and herself running away from the ranch one day and walking all the way to Gunnison before they were “apprehended”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lucien was baptized a member of the LDS church 5 Sep. 1911 in the beautiful Manti Temple, a privilege made possible at that time to children who turned eight in Sanpete Valley. Not very many children of the church had the opportunity of having their baptism in a temple. Soon other places were provided for those of Sanpete Valley also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lucien remembers, while a boy in Gunnison, of driving up to Manti to visit his Danish grandparents quite often, along with the rest of his family. In the wintertime they would heat large rocks to put under the quilts that covered them in the buggy, to keep their feet warm. He says he always looked forward to those trips with great anticipation and happiness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His father was away from home with the sheep so much of the time, both winters and summers, but when he was home they had such good times together. He remembers well the many trips he and his father took together in the mountains in the Gunnison area and later in Wyoming. They would travel all day in the mountains, catch fish for dinner and camp all night. He really enjoyed those trips as a boy. He has always enjoyed fishing, hunting and horseback riding, ever since he was a small lad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lucien was only a few months past five years old when his father bought his grandparents’ rock house on the corner of Second West and First North in Gunnison. This house is still standing and now owned by Ella Knighton Hansen. Lucien visited that home this past year (1968) for the first time in fifty-two years. He also visited the home in Mayfield, Utah where his father was born in 1880, <span id="page-742"></span> which is still standing and in use, and he visited his Christensen grandparents’ graves in the Manti Cemetery, which is overlooked by the beautiful Manti Temple where he was baptized.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was from the rock house in Gunnison that Lucien first started school the fall of 1909. He attended the public school there until he was just past twelve-and-a-half, when his family left Gunnison and moved to a ranch not many miles from Lyman, Wyoming, where his father had taken up a homestead. On 27 Mar. 1916 the Louis D. Christensen family, together with Aunt Elsie Bartholomew and her five children, left Gunnison by train headed for Wyoming. They had all slept the night before at Aunt Emma and Uncle Charlie Peterson’s place, who lived about a mile from the Gunnison depot. There were six children in the Christensen family at the time: LaFaun 14, Lucien 12½, Rex 10, Dale about 6½, Weldon just turned 4, and baby Alice nearly 2.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reaching Lyman, Wyoming the group were taken to the ranch they called “The Oasis” some few miles east of Lyman. They all lived for some weeks in two rooms of the four-roomed ranch cabin belonging to their father’s brother Chris, until homes could be built, one on each place that Louis and his sister Elsie had homesteaded. LaFaun remembers that until then they were so crowded that some even had to sleep on top of the big table and some under. Cousin Edith Bartholomew remembers that she was always hungry then - there never did seem to be enough food to satisfy them all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two summers living on The Oasis followed for Lucien and the others, during which time “firebugs” tried to drive them out, destroying one home built by his father and, after several attempts, burning down the other which replaced the first. The year’s crops of his Uncle Chris were destroyed by fire, his Uncle Chris killed. They were forced to guard what they had on the ranch with guns. Details of this period have been given in earlier chapters of the book.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The families moved into Lyman in winters <span id="page-743"></span> so the children could attend school. Lucien finished the grades in Lyman. He says, “I could hardly wait for school to let out each spring so that I could spend the summer on our ranch east of Lyman. I will never forget the good times I had there - nor the heartaches!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His father became sheriff of Uinta County, Wyoming and the family moved to Evanston, the county seat. Here Lucien attended High School. He says he played a little basketball and football there but wasn’t too good at either. Always a modest fellow and rather quiet, we could expect him to say that. Although he is a bit above average in height, he has never been husky; quite to the contrary, which might have accounted for any lack of success he may have felt he had in football.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After graduation from High School Lucien took a job as ticket clerk for the railroad in Evanston. In 1925, when the family moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming, for a time he transferred to Cheyenne and went to work for the railroad there, serving in many different capacities for that organization, During the depression of the 1930s he was laid off from the railroad for a year, during which time he went to Ogden, Utah, and lived with his sister LaFaun and family for a while and then spent the winter at a C C camp near Los Angeles, Calif, which he says he enjoyed. It was a change from railroading. He was active in the church in Cheyenne, serving as Assistant LDS Ward Clerk for several years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was nearing thirty-two years of age when he finally married. He and Dora Edith Thompson were wed in Ogden, Utah, 4 June 1935. They made their home in Cheyenne where two sons were born to them: Louis Lucien Jr. and Robert James, whom they called Jim. But things didn’t go well with Lucien and Dora and they were divorced. About ten years later Lucien married a divorcee with three young children, Mrs. Marie Victoria Nelson Hickey. He did not adopt these children but he practically raised them. He and their mother lived together many years until these step-children of his were grown. But their later married.years were unpleasant ones, especially for <span id="page-744"></span> Lucien, and they were finally divorced.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not long afterwards he retired from the railroad because of poor health. He had become very nervous. He worked his last day in Cheyenne 7 July 1965. Cousin Byron Peterson says that Lucien worked thirty-seven years without missing a pay check - this is entirely possible. It is a long time to have one’s “nose to the grindstone”. He moved immediately to Salt Lake City and secured his own apartment. His retirement pension plus a lifetime pass on the railroad makes it possible for him to enjoy life with little financial worry, since he lives modestly. He lives alone and, besides traveling quite often to visit relatives, he attends dances and other Senior Citizen activities. He loves social dancing and is a good dancing partner.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Lucien’s main hobbies today are his two tall and hdndsome sons, each pushing about six feet three inches. Both are doing very well, Jim in real estate in the Walnut Creek, California area and Louis Jr. as General Manager of the large Woolco Department Store in Phoenix, Arizona. He spends quite a bit of time with these boys and their families, visiting each about three times a year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His two sons (and their families) by his first wife, Dora Edith Thompson (div.) both born in Cheyenne, Uinta, Wyoming are:</p>
