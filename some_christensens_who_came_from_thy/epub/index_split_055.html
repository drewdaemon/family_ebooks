  <h2 class="calibre9" id="edith-lovena-christensen">Edith Lovena Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(9) Edith Lovena Christensen (2) later changed the spelling of her first name to Edythe. Her own history, entitled “As Memory Serves”, is a beautiful one and was written for her descendants. We have only room for a few highlights: - “I was born 22 Apr. 1900 in Ann Arbor, Washtenau, Michigan, where Father was attending school. I have been told that I was plump and good natured as a baby, with brown eyes and blonde hair. Later my hair turned to deep brown with copper glints.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My own earliest recollections date back to age four and a half, when mother and us children were living in Provo, Utah, while father was in Europe for further study. Adelbert and I had diphtheria. I was given the antitoxin in time to bring about my recovery - he was not and died. Young as I was I felt sobered and bereft. I had loved this older brother with all the tenacity of my little soul.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved to Salt Lake City in 1905 and in late 1906 or early 1907 father purchased a lovely home on 27th South and 9th East. On the extensive grounds father had a fishpond constructed and stocked with trout. In all family activities we children never felt left out or in want of the things that meant most - attention - pride in achievement - love in abundance. I was permitted a year of kindergarten at age six at the LDS School. I went back and forth by streetcar with Father, who was principal of the school. Regular school started for me at the Roosevelt grade school, judged to be about a mile from our home, which distance I walked in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-689" title="689"></span> snow or shine. I was eager to learn and soaked up the lessons like a sponge. The winter of 1909/10 I passed off the second and third grades in one year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was in our fishpond that spring of 1910 that our baby sister Elsie was drowned. My brothers and I had been commissioned to ‘watch out for her’ but were jumping the rope and forgot. I still blame myself for that tragedy. I never jumped the rope again! Later that spring we sold our cherished home to our wonderful Uncle Chris “I” and in July father, mother, Wendell age 7, Sheldon age 4, and I age 10, left for Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After two wonderful months in England, where father studied and ‘put himself out’ to give us numerous cultural and educational experiences, we sailed to Denmark to meet our beloved Christensen grandparents and with them visit Danish relatives there. Then all were bidden a fond adieu and father headed us towards Germany and school again. He continued to take time to show us spots of cultural and historical interest and inspire us with his stories of the same. We even visited the Berlin Palace and a parade of the Kaiser’s goose-stepping troups.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Leipzig was our destination and here father studied at the University. We shared the apartment of some German saints. Wendell and I attended the early grades. Among other things we learned to speak German quite well. I also started lessons on the piano. My teacher was Fraulein Hedwig Hartel, a convert to the church. At the conclusion of each lesson I was given a treat - usually a small molded pudding of blancmange with a raspberry syrup, which was lucious.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Christmas in Germany, long the toy center of the world, was almost beyond description. Lucky children, we were taken into exciting shops and throngs. Our eyes beheld things beyond anything we had yet imagined. The main event of spring that year (1911) was the arrival of my fourth brother, Luther. He was a beauty!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Returning to Provo that fall, Father was given a full professorship at BYU. I enrolled in fifth grade at BY Training School and attended <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-690" title="690"></span> there three years, through seventh grade. In those three years we lived in three different areas in the Provo and Pleasant View areas. Why we moved so much I’ll never know. Mother always left a place looking better than she found it, which took a lot of work. We all helped. It was in Pleasant View the spring of 1914 that my sister Lucile was born.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I never did attend eighth grade, for that fall found us in Rexburg, Idaho, where Father had been sent by the church to head the Ricks Academy. I started as a freshman in high school that year and made an “A” average for the next three years. I was fond of music and was chosen as a member of a ladies double trio in school, which performed often. During my second summer I took a six weeks course in piano - my first since Leipzig.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Discipline was strict in our home. Rules were laid down quietly but firmly. I was informed early that I might start dating following my seventeenth birthday. The day finally arrived and I accepted a date from a fine young man to attend a school dance. Father stipulated a rather early time to return. Via our homeward journey we stopped at a drugstore for refreshments. Oh my! We discovered that even by walking fast we would still be a half hour late. Father met us at the door. He said little and that in a quiet voice of steel. The young man left and never braved another date with me. Underneath my disappointment I knew I had broken a promise and deserved punishment, yet deeper still I felt protected. My father loved me enough to keep the fortress tight!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The spring of 1917 found us living in the small village of LaVerkin in southern Utah’s Dixie. I had developed some anemia and Father, eager to get out from under the pressures of school work, had used this as a partial excuse to resign his position in Rexburg, to mother’s dismay. A four-roomed log hut overlooking the murky Virgin River was our home for awhile. It was pretty desolate. Lizards scuttled over the sandy soil, sometimes invading our very rooms. But between the bright hot summer sun and dippings in the mineral springs there, I recovered my health. We moved into a brick home in the fall and the three boys <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-691" title="691"></span> went to school but I stayed out and helped at home, gave piano lessons, which bolstered my confidence and also my finances, worked in Sunday School and M.I.A. and served as drama and music director for the young people of the community.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father received another church call the spring of 1918, this time to preside over the Millard Academy at Hinckley, Utah, so we moved again. The Academy was small and rundown but father was a good organizer and a hard worker. With his advice and help I started as a teacher of music at the Academy and also taught a class of theology, Book of Mormon, besides taking a few classes. I did soprano solo work for school and church, became the Ward organist and organized and played piano for a four-piece orchestra. There was the usual whirl of dances, parties, picnics, etc., and being a ‘new girl’ I walked off with the prize in escorts in Hinckley, as I had in LaVerkin.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Margaret, the folks’ last child, was born there in May 1919. That spring Father gave up school work for good and turned his attention to others of his projects. He purchased the big Star Ranch north of Nephi, Utah, together with his brother Albert and brother-in-law Otis Ercanback. So we moved to Star Ranch and had a busy and beautiful summer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father rented a home in Provo and moved us there for school that winter. I entered as a freshman at B.Y.U. I studied voice with Florence Jeppersen (Madsen) among other subjects, and renewed my acquaintance with friends I had known earlier at the Training School, especially Grace Nixon. At the close of school the spring of 1920 the family moved back to Star Ranch but I stayed on for twelve weeks of summer school. That fall the folks moved back to Provo for school and I enrolled for my second year at B.Y.U.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“One day about March of 1921 my friend Grace asked me suddenly, ‘How would you like to go to Boston with me to study next fall?’ Would I indeed! I could hardly wait to ask my parents. My practical mother was not enthused but my <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-692" title="692"></span> dreamer-of-a-father was elated and thought he could see me through. Grace was graduating that spring while I had had only two winters and one summer of college.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The day of departure arrived but the money father expected did not. However, he had arranged for me a loan of $300.00 through the church school system. This would barely pay my fare, my tuition at the Leland Powers School of Dramatic Art and my first month’s rent, with a little left over. Florence Jepperson had written ahead and engaged us room and board with a couple she knew in Boston. When we arrived there were about three weeks left before school started. I immediately found a job as waitress in a downtown cafe. The place was busy and the trays were heavy. I stayed on but looked for something better.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I know it was through prayer that I ran across the exclusive little French Pastry Shop owned and managed by Mr. Constantin, a Greek and a gentleman in every sense of the word. I was hired as waitress on the spot. The wage was good and soon I was promoted to cashier with a raise in salary. My hours were from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, and since school hours were from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. this was perfect. The subway opened within a few steps of the shop and the exit was near my apartment.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grace didn’t have to work but she had to be careful. She got a monthly check from home, but I got none. I had to make my own way. With insufficient money for board I asked our landlady for permission to fix my own meals. Breakfast consisted of hot chocolate made with canned milk and water, and a peanut butter or honey sandwich. Lunch consisted of a large 5¢ apple or, if I was extra hungry, a 10%cent; plate of spaghetti purchased on my way from school. My night meal, included with my job, was soup or salad, a sandwich, certain pastries or ice cream. And thus I managed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I decided to change from drama to my first love, music, the next fall and planned to enter the New England Conservatory of Music. Funds would not allow for a trip home that summer so I accepted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-693" title="693"></span> a summer job with still more money from my employer, Mr, Constantin, which was to introduce his French candies in connection with a linen shop in the seaside resort town of Magnolia, Maine. I lodged at the home of the charming Jewish woman who tended the Linen Shop. I discovered that fine minds, noble spirits and kindly hearts are to be found in many places, regardless of race, rank or creed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grace and I found a small one-room apartment with tiny kitchen and bath close to the Conservatory of Music where I registered and then faced the manager in his private office. I did not have the price of tuition, since the money I had been promised from home failed to arrive and my own earnings were insufficient. He waived immediate payment and as the year advanced gave me every advantage of discount plus a partial scholarship, In return I promised dedicated work and I kept my promise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I took vocal, piano, harmony, solfeggio, sight reading and history of music. My aim was to practice from five to six hours a day. I worked out a tight schedule and stuck to it. I didn’t work otherwise except at a small job playing piano for a children’s dance studio and as a paid singer at an Episcopal church on Sunday which came early enough for me to attend my own church service later. My health was good and my ambitions high.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There were a number of other Utahns studying there. Among the male students and LDS missionaries we did not lack for dates but limited our dating to one night a week and Sunday afternoons. We were pretty selective in the things we attended - operas, concerts, the best in musical comedy, Shakespeare’s plays, etc. I had an invitation to the Harvard Junior Prom that year - it was quite an occasion. Saturdays we sometimes went sight seeing to spots of historical interest or visited art galleries to browse.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Though I received a little help from home occasionally and some from a business friend in Utah, yet by money standards I was ‘poor’, if not ‘in need’, although somehow I felt blessed and ‘rich’. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-694" title="694"></span> I remember the time our cupboard was bare. I had spent my last quarter on apples and day old rolls. Having eaten these we were entirely without food. My pay wasn’t due for a few days and Grace’s check, usually so prompt, had not come. We prayed earnestly that night but morning came and still nothing, We didn’t eat the second day and repeated the prayers. Morning broke again but there was still no food. We went to school but both were weak. My prayers were constant though silent throughout that day. Returning home I found a letter from Uncle Henry Bartholomew containing a $10.00 bill. He said he thought I might be able to use it. I dropped to my knees in thanksgiving, then went out to market. We had more than one period of forced fasting!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring I had a letter from home saying I was needed badly. The family’s finances had reached low ebb, father’s health was in a poor state, and mother was desperate. The family had moved to Salt Lake into a shabby house on a bend of the Jordan River. I scraped up money for my fare and was on my way home in a matter of days. I found conditions as described with the necessity of getting an immediate job. I worked temporarily collecting for an insurance company and soliciting catering orders - it was hard and discouraging work. By fall I had landed a position in the Madison school, teaching music in the upper grades and another subject. J. Spencer Cornwall, music supervisor of the district, often visited my classes and asked me at one time if I intended to go east for further study. He had a plan in mind for teaching group piano in the grades and said if I could qualify he would give me the opportunity to start it. I determined to return to Boston.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the meantime, with the help of my earnings, things began looking up for the family. We left the old home on the bend of the Jordan and rented an attractive two story red brick house at 1876 South Main St. There were plenty of rooms for me a music studio and a sewing room for mother, who was beginning to make temple and burial clothes for the church at a fair profit. It was while living here that one of the main events of my life occurred. Through a blind date arranged <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-695" title="695"></span> by friends, I met Dr. Burtis F. Robbins who had just returned from his training in New York and was ready to start his practice. He looked distinguished but was a man of few words - mostly of one syllable, or so it seemed to me. I was used to being catered to and amused, if you please. The evening of dinner and dancing finally over he drove me home, stopped the car, and resting his hands on the wheel, remained silent. Strangely, at that moment an inner voice spoke to me in ringing clearness: ‘Edythe, this is the man!’ In my heart of hearts that first night I knew that Dr. Robbins was the one for me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He continued to date me - not often but consistently. He took me to many of the best things. He was a busy man setting up his practice, and besides was superintendent of the Sunday School and worked in the M.I.A. in the 18th Ward. I became active in the Farmers’ Ward, counselor in M.I.A., director of the Ward plays and doing things musically - I’m sure Dr, Robbins was much sought after and I did my share of other dating. At one time I mentioned to him that come fall I thought of going east again. ‘Oh, you don’t want to do that’ was his answer. Fall came and I prepared to go to Boston. I hadn’t heard a word from my Dr. friend for three weeks and was hurt and left without a word to him. Arriving in Boston I received the longest letter I have ever received from Burtis - but no proposal of marriage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I threw myself into my work at the Conservatory - mostly piano, for which I had the best teacher of my career. I became engaged that winter to a young law student from Utah who was graduating from Harvard. No sooner was this done than I knew I couldn’t go through with it. But how to get out of it without hurting him? There is no such thing - such things always hurt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I returned home the spring of 1925. Plans were laid for me to begin work teaching group piano in the fall. Burtis welcomed me with enthusiasm but dating went on the same - slowly. The winter went by and I also taught part of the summer. The fall of 1926 rolled around and with it my second year of teaching group piano. I took <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-696" title="696"></span> piano students after school. I was now twenty-six - goodness I was getting old! I longed for a husband and children of my own. Another young man was pressing me for marriage but I couldn’t get my mind off Burtis. I spoke to Father about him, his seeming lack of gallantry and attention. ‘What kind of a man do you really want - one who is doing big things or one who spends his energy doing little ones?’ And he smiled.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had been blessed with much, especially experience, but still had no home of my own. I did some serious thinking and decided on a plan. I wrote my resolve in a long letter telling Burtis I was through. I would hand it to him the next time he came. It was to be dramatic - final! The day of Dec. 14th dawned. Burtis called that afternoon. I went to the door and extended the letter. He didn’t take it but handed a small packet to me instead. It held a large, square-cut, glittering diamond. The wedding was set for Jan. 14th, one month away. Later that afternoon there arrived a box of long stemmed red roses, and they have been arriving on that same date every year since. We were married in the Salt Lake Temple by Pres. Heber J. Grant. I continued to teach to the end of that school year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“That was forty-one years ago. Burtis has been a wonderful husband and provider. He has gone along with me in all my ‘flights of fancy’ whether it be the collecting of oriental rugs and other works of art, antique furniture buying, home remodeling and decorating, creative work with rock and wood, painting and sculpturing, twelve years with the Tabernacle choir, or travel to distant lands. He has been a wonderful father to our one boy and four girls. There was always money for lessons from the best teachers, violin, cello, piano and voice. There was money for them to study in distant cities and for our son’s mission to Japan. There was always money for the important things. We had five Temple marriages in some over four years, including four beautiful home receptions for which nothing was spared.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Burtis has been a wonderful son-in-law, opening our home to Mother and furnishing her with her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-697" title="697"></span> own apartment there as long as she lived and all else he could supply that her aging heart desired. He has been a wonderful member of the church, serving in numerous important capacities, the climax of which would surely be presiding over the East German Mission (later changed to North German) from Aug. 1957 to Dec. 1959, which included over 9,000 Saints, about half of whom were behind the Iron Curtain, where I labored with him among the people I had learned to love as a child.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the forty-one years my husband, children and grandchildren have always been my greatest joy and concern. My home has been my castle, whether our first rented apartment on 3rd Ave. and C St.; our first owned home at 121 B St.; our lovely home of sixteen years at 1176 East South Temple; our farm, where the Skyline High now stands, and the series of tents and cabins in which we lived there in summers from 1934 to 1956; or our beautiful ‘dream house’ at 3150 East 3600 South into which we moved following our mission.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We have traveled extensively during our later years, sometimes taking our married children along, to many points of interest in the U.S.A., Canada, Alaska, the Holy Lands, Japan, China, Egypt, New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti, Fiji, Hawaii, and other distant lands. Some of these latter years have been marred for me by poor health, including a heart condition. I have been promised other trips if my health improves. These should include Mexico and South America. We might then see some of the Book of Mormon locales and artifacts first hand. I rest content however, a most blessed and privileged woman. My store of memories is rich and satisfying. It is not necessary that I be given more. As I have said and say of our five children I also say of our twenty-five grandchildren: ‘These are my jewels!’ The future is in their hands and I trust them.”</p>
