  <p class="calibre1">(1) Pearl Eva Christensen (1) writes of herself:— “I was born 7 Oct. 1894 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. I have blue-green eyes and blond hair. People say I have a pleasant but quiet personality. I was baptized a member of the LDS church 21 Oct. 1902 in the Manti Temple by Brother Christian Anderson and confirmed the same day and place by John B. Maiben. Grandmother Christensen took me there along with two of my cousins, Harold Christensen and Leo Nelson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My first day of school I went hand in hand with my friend Erma Lundberg. My first teacher was Amber Bardsley. I remember Grandma Christensen’s chicken soup and dumplings, also her jelly-roll cake which she made each Sunday for the school teachers who boarded with her. She was a generous person who often invited friends and relatives to her house to eat. I remember Grandpa Christensen Singing Danish songs and telling stories as we children walked with him as he drove his cows home from the west pasture. I remember going to Christenburg when I was young to visit my other grandparents, Ole and Inger Larsen, One time while crossing the swift Sanpitch River near their place in a wagon, we barely made it across. Also, when I was a girl, I used to often go with my father on short business trips here and there. He was so much fun and such a wonderful father to me. He used to call me his fat little Danish girl because I was plump and had long hair in braids.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was Primary organist for one year in the Gunnison Ward at age twelve and was an attendant to the queen, Miss Ella Bywater, at the Pioneer Day celebration there in 1906. If I turned up missing, mother could usually find me somewhere dressing old ladies’ hair or assisting the old ladies in our neighborhood, for that is what took my fancy at that age.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1910 sickness came to our home and I lost two younger sisters, Elora and Orilla, of scarlet fever within five days of each other. I can still remember how beautiful they looked in their coffins but how grief-stricken we all were. That same summer father bought a lovely <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-677" title="677"></span> brick house from his brother Andrew at 3020 South 9th East in Salt Lake City and we moved there. We were in the Forest Dale Ward where I took part in Sunday School and M.I.A. and later taught in Primary for two years with Ella Seegmiller.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had finished fifth grade before we moved and I attended school in Salt Lake City at the Roosevelt school on 9th East and 33rd South from where I graduated from eighth grade. Then I attended the LDS High School. It was during this time that I had the wonderful experience of singing in the Tabernacle Choir for about three years. I studied under Evan Stephens. This was one of the choicest experiences of my girlhood!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At age twenty-one I took up a homestead beside my father’s ranch on The Oasis near Lyman, Wyoming. Father had a four room house built, two rooms on his side of the land and two rooms on my side. I lived on the ranch in summers and in Lyman in the winters. It was while living in Lyman that I was called to be a visiting teacher in the Relief Society for the first time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father at this time was manager and a large stockholder of the Bennion Livestock Company. A man by the name of Peter A. Jensen was also a stockholder and foreman in the same com- pany. It was on The Oasis that our crops were burned and that father’s untimely death occurred. Nothing can ever blot out the intense feeling of grief and despair that came over me that October 1917. I gave up the homestead and moved back to Salt Lake City sometime after that and had a comforting patriarchal blessing from Hyrum G, Smith.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After father’s death Peter A. Jensen became manager of the Bennion Livestock Company. He was a very kind and gentle man and came often to visit us. He had soft red curly hair, big blue eyes, was a classy dresser and an excellent dancing partner. He and I fell in love and were married 14 July 1920 in Farmington, Utah. I was always his ‘darling’. (Peter August Jensen was born 27 Mar, 1884 in Gunnison, Utah, the son of Michael and Anna Lena Peterson Jensen), We spent our honeymoon on the Weber Ranch, After two years <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-678" title="678"></span> wwe moved to Eureka, Nevada, where Peter ran the air compressor for the Uncle Sam’s Mine. After a year we moved to Goshen, Utah where he worked as a special timberman in the Tintic Standard mine, then moved over to Eureka, Utah, working for the same company. He then went back to work for the Howells and Sharp Livestock Co., which had bought out the Bennion Livestock Co., and worked for them until his death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When we were first married we purchased a brick home at 363 East 21st South in Salt Lake City and rented it out for ten years. Finally we moved into this home of ours after losing a darling little son who was stillborn. Then our first daughter, Dartear Pearline, was born and then we lost another little son who was also stillborn. Our last child, Arminta Caroline, soon came along to cheer our hearts. Both girls had beautiful blond curly hair and were blessed with musical voices. Dartear sang solos when she was very young in Ward and school functions and also on the radio, Arminta also sang in such affairs and did solo work in “Showboat” and “Promised Valley”. In the meantime I taught in Primary and among other things was able to bring two little boys into activity in the church. They had been neglected and Peter had great influence with them. We kept in touch with them over the years. One of these boys went on a mission when eighteen years of age, the other died in the service fighting for his country.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Dartear was married her husband went directly into the service at Camp Campbell, Kentucky. When her first baby was born I went to live with them in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. I only stayed there a few weeks and then went to Nashville, Tennessee with Mrs. Barbee, a relative of Reed Smoot’s. Later, when Dartear’s husband was transferred to Camp Cook near Santa Maria, California, while they went ahead by automobile to get settled I tended their baby, Dawn Lynn, and later took her by train to join them. I had a fine trip seeing all the sights, gathering shells near the ocean and enjoying the huge palm trees that I had never seen before,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Arminta was married she and her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-679" title="679"></span> husband moved to Fairbanks, Alaska. When their first child was born there I went to visit them. The trip took thirteen hours of flying time. I stayed three months that summer. The first LDS chapel dedicated in Fairbanks was where baby David was blessed. While there I saw the great Northern Lights, the Midnight Sun, and attended their one hundred year centennial celebration. I saw large white Alaskan wolf dogs with light blue eyes and sled dogs in darker shades. I saw the gold dredge in operation and also the big fish wheel. I saw the perma frost which looked like a big layer cake with different shades of icing in between. I had a ride in an army jet at one of the largest military camps in the north. Flying back from Alaska we had difficulty with one engine and they gave us Mae West wings to put on twice. We were afraid we wouldn’t make it. We stopped at Yakima, Washington for repairs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 29 Nov. 1958 in Salt Lake City my ‘darling’ died suddenly. I was stricken with grief. Afterwards, the girls thought it would do me good to take a trip. So I attended the Hill Cumorah pageant and other places of early church interest. I attended a meeting at the Sacred Grove where it poured rain all around but not a drop touched us. Returning to Salt Lake City I later went to the temple there and had Peter and myself sealed together as man and wife for eternity, 26 June 1959. I was also sealed to my parents there that same day. Then I went on a temple tour of Manti, St. George, Mesa and Los Angeles temples and enjoyed the trip so very much.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After coming home I went to work as a practical nurse, working with tiny babies and small children. Sometimes I cared for elderly women in their homes or acted as a companion on their travels. I joined the D.U.P. and served as a teacher in our camp for the year 1960. In 1959 I was put in as work director in the Wells Ward Relief Society. I took two courses in genealogy and am still working at that, I-now go often to the Salt Lake Temple to do work for the dead. I am in very good health and still going strong as I approach my seventy-fifth birthday (1969).” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-680" title="680"></span></p>
