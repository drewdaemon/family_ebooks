  <p class="calibre1">(39) Imelda Peterson (6) was born 13 Jan, 1910 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the house on the ranch a mile east of town. She grew up in Gunnison, attending school there and graduating from High School. Her brother Byron says she was the scholar of the family and was a fine speller, <span id="page-833"></span> being able to “spell down” anyone in her class when spelling matches were held.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Imelda was going on eighteen when her mother died. Her sister Ada soon married and in early 1930 Byron left for his mission. She was left to care for things at the home. She was always active in the organizations of the church. Cousin Vera Clark lived with her the winter of 1930/31 and went to school in Gunnison. She remembers how good Imelda and Uncle Charles were to her. They took her along to Delta on occasions to visit Ada, and Imelda took her to MIA with her to visit her class, for she taught the Beehive girls at that time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Imelda attended Snow College at Ephraim and also BYU at Provo for one quarter. Then she went with Cousin Gladys to Salt Lake to attend Henager Business College for a short while. In early spring of 1934 she was called to serve in the Canadian Mission. She writes of this:- “I was out for twenty months. I left the Mission Home 21 Mar. 1934. The cities of Hamilton, St. Catherines and Montreal were my assignments. Toronto was our Mission Home in Canada and we traveled both by land and by water to our missionary conventions that were held there. We joined with many missionaries at the Prophet Joseph Smith’s birthplace in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, in an outstanding missionary reunion. We were about fifty in number and were there for five wonderful days. We traveled by bus from Montreal and ferried across Lake Champlain. The beauty of the country still lingers in my memory. Another inspiring missionary conference was held on Mt, Patriarch. It was called the South Royalton reunion. John Bluth was our mission president at that time and Elder Wallis, traveling Patriarch at the time, officiated.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Imelda’s sister Ada writes: “At one time Imelda’s mission president was Woodrow Miller of the Miller Honey Company. One of her companions in the mission field was Chyio Thomas, daughter of U. S. Senator Thomas from Utah. In Dec. 1936 she was released from her mission and she and Chyio were invited to the White House as <span id="page-834"></span> guests of Senator Thomas. This was another highlight in her life.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometime after returning from her mission Imelda went to California with a girl friend to find employment. She also took some nurses training while there. It was in California that she met her future husband at a “jitney dance” in Los Angeles. She was married 11 Jan. 1941 in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Albert Elvin Kissinger (b. 7 May 1887 in Castleton, Illinois to Frank and Katherine Bali Kissinger). He, however, often went by the name of Robert. He was tall and handsome and a photographer by trade. He was nearly thirteen years Imelda’s senior and she was his fourth wife. They made their home in Los Angeles. They had two children, a daughter Karma and a son Chad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Oct. 31, 1958 Imelda wrote of her family:- “Our daughter Karma is going on seventeen, a senior in high school. She is interested in many different lines of endeavor - art, music, hair styling, fashions. She seems to think she would like to be in the fashion field. She will have more time after school is out this summer to follow along this line.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our son Chad is nine and has been a Cub Scout for a year now. He is having a good active time. It has given his mother a full schedule too, for I am now a ‘Den Mother’ on top of all my other responsibilities. Chad enjoys school very much, is a great reader, has a good thinking head and uses it and is advanced for his years. He is always looking for something more active in school and has been given special assignments by his teachers, as he gets things done. At present he is a ‘safety’ for playground activities. He is observant and in love with life. I’m very grateful for these two children and hope to do a good job by them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Their father is not a member of the church and though born a Methodist, with religious ministers in his father’s family, is not seeking any religion nor at all interested in it. His own father was one of thirteen children who mostly had large families, so there are many by the name of Kissinger in the country. My husband himself has had nine children, three by his first marriage, two by the second, two <span id="page-835"></span> by the third and now our two children. What do I do about our genealogy?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though not too strong or not always in good health, Imelda has worked a lot outside the home from time to time. She sold Child Craft and World Book for awhile and was also a saleslady for other things. She has worked in hospitals and at private nursing. Her husband passed away in December 1963 in Los Angeles after a long and painful illness. He was nearing his seventy-sixth birthday. Since then Imelda has done the best she could in providing for her family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ada brings her sister’s story up to date in these words:- “Imelda dear is busy in her way too. Much sickness has been her unhappiness. Her husband died of cancer and her daughter Karma developed brittle diabetes at the age of twenty and has been in and out of the hospital. She is so gifted in art, music and creative ability - it seems a shame to have her thus handicapped. Her son Chad is a fine chap and now works for Standard Oil. Today Imelda is a registered practical nurse and employed by Eddie Albert, the TV and motion picture star, to care for his aged father. She is active in Relief Society and Sunday School.”</p>
