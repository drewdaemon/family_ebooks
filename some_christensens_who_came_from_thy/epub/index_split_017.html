  <p class="calibre1">Bright and early the morning of Wednesday April 18th 1866, a farm wagon, driven by a good natured old farmer, drew up at the Christensen place where Christen’s two-seated carriage stood ready and waiting. The big trunks and large baggage were soon hoisted into the wagon and then Maren, Else and Laurs took their places there, sitting on various rolls of bedding. They would pick up Lars Myrup on the way. Karen, Christen and the three young girls occupied the carriage, together with lunch sacks, boxes, packages and bags. Christen, driving his sleek black team of mares, led out into the country road and the wagon followed. Of course they were headed for Aalborg, the point of rendezvous for all Mormon Saints leaving on the next church-sponsored voyage to America’s Zion, which was between 80 <span id="page-166"></span> and 90 American miles from Kobberø. Happiness was reflected on every face, even the gentle Karen’s; for she was feeling much better than for several months past. Christen was wearing his coin lined vest under his coat, but few knew it. He was taking no chance with the pickpockets. Sena was still nibbling on her breakfast biscuit. The young people in the wagon joshed along with the old farmer who had been hired to drive them to their destination. Pouline and Trina were all eyes, and full of questions about everything new they saw and far too excited to settle down. Soon Karen was weary of them and begged Christen to stop and let them get out and go ride in the wagon with Laurs and Else, while Maren came into the carriage with them, to look out for Sena. And so the two vehicles traveled along, one following the other, past Gettrup and the white church, on through Gundtoft, which was close to Flarup, and then on to Ydby, where they turned sharply into the main traveled highway through Thy. Then they took a north-easterly direction paralleling the shores of the lovely Limfjord and its bays, until they passed near Stagstrup and on to Sundby. It was here that Else pointed out the road that turned off west towards her home town of Nørhaa, which was only about 10 kilometers (six miles) away. How simple it would have been to turn off there and make their way to her parents’ home to rest. She turned and gazed back, as the wagon drove on past the turn, straining her eyes in looking as long as she could see in the direction of Nørhaa. Laurs reached out and patted her arm - but said nothing then.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some six or so miles later they were in Thisted City, which was by far the largest place in Jutland. It was then well into the afternoon and, although they hoped to reach Myrupgaard, in Lild Parish, before nightfall, they stopped for a time to rest mainly because of the weary Karen. While she rested and Christen and the old farmer watered and fed the horses, Laurs and Else took the three little girls for a brief stroll through beautiful Thisted. Maren had other things than sightseeing to think of since at Myrupgaard, now only some fifteen miles away, she would again greet her sweetheart, Lars Myrup. He had arranged for <span id="page-167"></span> them to spend the night there with his people, it being midway between Aalborg and Kobberø. Afterwards they all sat together on a green bank overlooking blue Thisted Bay in the Limfjord and ate a lunch, watching the ships come and go in the harbor there. There were birds flying in all directions; none of them had ever seen so many flying birds all at once before. Perhaps they hadn’t remembered that they were approaching the area of Vejlerne, a fjord bay partly filled up by sand, one of Europe’s major breeding places for wild birds. It was the mating season for birds now too!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The area around Thisted City was more hilly, as it was farther north, and they soon moved into more trees as they left there for Myrupgaard, It was fun discovering northernmost Jutland, for one never knew what lay hidden behind the next bend in the road or beyond the nearest crest of hills. There was a striking and charming contrast between the gentle estuaries of its east coast and the rougher scenery of its west coast, where the Christensens had come from. Towns and villages were spread in pockets, large and small, some tucked away in valleys, others, with twisted narrow streets, obstinately climbing hillsides. In between the extremes of east and west coasts were stretches of meadowland and winding streams. Green routes crossed lush undulating hills, which could give way unexpectedly to flat, brown moorland with distant views of then, again, to a chain of lakes. Not far to the east of the route the Christensens were taking to Myrupgaard was Vikingegrave, a historic graveyard from the Viking period of a thousand years before. Yes, in Denmark’s Thy, past, present and future went hand in hand. This was the area that had been their home and that they would soon be leaving, perhaps forever.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They spent the night at Myrupgaard with Elder Myrup’s people, where Lars himself had greeted them with joy and thanksgiving. The following morning early the group took off towards Aalborg, the two happy couples, anticipating their marriages within a few days, riding in the <span id="page-168"></span> wagon driven by the old farmer, while Christen, Karen and the younger girls again occupied the carriage. Going north a few more miles they soon swung almost east around Lund Fjord. Lars Myrup pointed out that directly north a mile or so from there was Bulbjerg, a white chalk cliff towering out over the Skagerrak Sea some 165 feet, and farther out into the water another cliff, Skarreklit. The company continued to travel on east through hills, forest areas and many towns and villages, skirting lakes and streams for a good part of the day, turning north again they crossed a great expanse of flatland which had originally been a great bog. Then they turned directly south towards the Limfjord, where its waters had narrowed to not more than the width of a large river. Here on the north side of the lovely fjord lay one of the largest Viking burial grounds in Denmark, Lindholm Høje, where the grave mounds as usual were outlined by rocks, in the shape of ships. Nearby was the large town of Nørresundby, through which they drove and which was linked to the city of Aalborg by a bridge going across the Limfjord, south.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Crossing over the water on this pontoon bridge, the Christensens and their friends were soon in Aalborg. It was the first time any of them, except Christen and Lars Myrup, had been there and the largest place they had ever seen. So here it was - the city of which they had heard so much! Known for its numerous waterways, as well as its antiquity, Aalborg had been a commercial center for centuries. Large merchants’ houses and warehouses, the house of Jens Bang (1624) and Aalborg Castle (1539) dominated the town center. Its industries (akvavit, cement, tobacco) had more recently carried its name far and wide. Rightly called a gay and friendly town, its large parks, with many sculptures, relieved the pattern of houses, and restaurants, theaters, and the pleasure gardens (Tivoli-Karolinelund) provided healthy entertainment. Other places of interest there included the St. Budolfi (Botolph) Church; the Monastery of the Holy Ghost (1432); Aalborg Museum of History and Art; the Aalborg Hall (the biggest congress hall in Scandinavia), the</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">The Aalborg Branch of the LDS Church, established there fifteen years and some months before, 25 Nov. 1850, was now one of the best and most active branches of the LDS Church in all of Scandinavia. Elder Hans Jensen (Hals) of Manti, Utah, U.S, A., was then president of the Aalborg Branch or Conference and Elder Morten Lund of Fountain Green, Utah, president of the adjoining Vendsyssel Conference. These two brethren were then in Aalborg to assist the incoming members with their preparations and oversee the job of emigrating the Saints from their areas. Brother Lund himself was also preparing to return to his home in America with the group. There would be the sick to administer to, marriages to look after, additional funds to secure for the more needy, encouragement to give, besides meetings, arrangements, advice, and all the other numerous details attendant to such an undertaking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since the Christen Christensen party from Kobberø was among the very first to arrive in Aalborg, the port of departure, that April of 1866, they were immediately housed in the Saints’ meeting hall there. As additional emigrants continued to arrive from both Conferences the Saints’ hall proved to be far too small to accommodate them all, so an additional larger hall was hired on Bispensgade street where most of those from the Vendsyssel area took up quarters, while all made final preparation for the long journey ahead. Emigrants continued to arrive until there were nearly two hundred of them. Many meetings were held in which the necessary instructions were imparted by the brethren who had experience in emigration matters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the first things the Christensens had to take care of after getting temporarily settled in Aalborg was the marriage of their son and daughter. So three days after their arrival in that city, it being Sunday 22 April 1866, a double <span id="page-170"></span> wedding ceremony was held, undoubtedly at the Saints Meeting Hall, and Maren Christensen became the bride of Elder Lars C. N. Myrup, while Laurs M. C. Christensen was wed to Else Kathrine Andersen. It is most likely that the president of the Aalborg Branch, Elder Hans Jensen, officiated in the presence of the family, friends and members. Else felt somewhat alone since none of her own people were present at the wedding. In fact, none of her relatives had ever met her intended husband, although they might easily have, had they been willing to extend an invitation. Else’s past had to be forced aside now - ‘twas but the prologue to a new and more exacting life ahead. Recollections of the bitter and sweet of it, however, would linger with her as long as memory remained.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were numerous other things requiring the Christensens’ attention during those four weeks they were in Aalborg, Having their likenesses taken by a professional photographer was an important item on their agenda. So, attired in their best, they went and had a daguerreotype made of their family group, desiring to record themselves as they were just before leaving Old Denmark. (Little did they know then how reproductions of this photo on tin would be treasured by their posterities more than a hundred years hence.) So we see them as they posed for that family portrait in April 1866, more than a century ago. There is Christen himself and his son Laurs in the Sunday suits, each with curly hair, white shirt, hand-bowed tie, and waistcoat with an impressive watchchain marching across it. The gentle Karen is seated there on the right of Christen, wearing her large fringed shawl and bonnet tied under her chin, with a dainty white handmade lace collar at her throat and yards and yards of long, full skirt billowing out around her in the latest fashion, doubtless held so by several stiffly starched underskirts. Maren stands back of her mother, with amber ear-drops and her hair in a snood, looking rather solemn for a newly-wedded bride of seventeen, hardly doing justice to her real charm and beauty. Pouline and Petrine, standing on either side of Karen, look very pretty in their bright plaid dresses with long, ballooned sleeves, cinchened-in waists, full long skirts and <span id="page-171"></span> belts with fancy buckles, each wearing a white lace collar like their mother’s and amber ear-drops and beads. Little Sena, in her long full-skirted, full-sleeved costume with tight belt and round buckle, also wears a lovely white collar, though a sort of fichu-type one; standing between her father’s knees, where he is seated, she looks very preoccupied, likely with the fellow who is taking the picture. All the females, both young and old, must have been well shod in the popular high-buttoned shoes, even Sena, for these folks were well-to-do Jutlandic peasants. Later the newlyweds, the four of them together, had their pictures taken at the same establishment; Lars Myrup and Laurs Christensen seated and their wives, Maren and Else, in shawls and bonnets, standing up proudly behind them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Extra shopping for the daily necessities and special essentials had to be done but Christen and the married couples took care of this and as many of the other daily tasks as they could manage, leaving the frail Karen free to relax and rest as best she could under the circumstances, for she so much needed to conserve her strength for the more difficult days to come. Almost the complete care of the children was assumed by them also in order to lighten that burden for the pregnant mother. Yes, those were busy people, those Christensens, and Christen Christensen was a very busy man. It is likely that the presiding brethren in Aalborg became well acquainted with him and his family. It is also most likely that they counseled with him often and depended on him for extra money to help out the great cause; for we have been told that he not only helped pay off the debts of the Aalborg Branch but that he also financed the emigration of at least thirty of the Saints at that time, besides the nine members of his own party. And among other things, Christen had to attend to the selling of his fine team and carriage but likely left that until the very last in order to have convenient transportation in and about the city for his family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It must have been a strange honeymoon for the two couples, having to share quarters in the <span id="page-172"></span> Saints meeting hall with nearly a hundred other people of all ages. That they were joshed and jollied by many is easy to imagine - but that Laurs M. C. Christensen always had a ready and witty answer for each friendly offender is still easier to believe. Did the four of them ever take the opportunity to steal away together and explore Aalborg? Did they borrow father Christen’s team and carriage for rides through the city streets or along the shore of the beautiful Limfjord? Or did their tastes run to theatres, pleasure gardens, parks, museums and the zoo? It is not likely that these honeymooners indulged in many of the frivolities in Aalborg. Elder Myrup must have been kept pretty busy seeing to the problems of the emigrating converts he had made, besides other branch responsibilities. The other three must have been well occupied with the many daily tasks pertaining to the ordinary everyday living in the Christensen family - meals, washing of dishes and clothes, mending, minding the children, etc. And there were always long black stockings to be knit - no woman could hardly keep ahead of that. Yes, all these things had to go forward, along with the general preparations for the voyage, whether or no. These emigrant honeymooners from Thy were likely treated much as ordinary people - but it must have been fun being married and planning a new home in a new land anyway!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elder Carl Widerborg was President of the Scandinavian Mission at that time, Since the transportation of Scandinavian emigrants directly from Hamburg, Germany to New York had proved so successful the year before, it was decided that the same route should be taken by the emigrants in 1866, bypassing Liverpool and other ports enroute. So President Brigham Young Jr. and Elder John W. Young, from the European Mission headquarters in Liverpool, personally went to Hamburg in late April to assist President Widerborg in making the necessary arrangements to that end. By the middle of May all was in order for the departure of the year’s first company of emigrating Saints from Scandinavia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wednesday, May 16, 1866, had been set for the day of their departure from Aalborg. What a hurry-scurry, hustle and bustle everyone was in! How many families there were - children swarmed all over! The ship “Dania” was riding at anchor in the harbor awaiting their boarding, and by midday most of them were making their way toward the point of embarkment, marching along in groups, singing the songs of Zion lustily, in their native tongue. Friends and relatives of the departing gathered to say goodbye and tearful embraces were witnessed on all sides. Curious onlookers grouped themselves along the shore - watching the “Mormons”; some probably thinking to themselves or saying it outright, — “Good riddance!” Bedding rolls, bundles, bags and baggage were piled about, ready to be loaded, and on some of them people stretched to rest momentarily. Government inspectors were going over everything and doctors looked at everyone as their tickets were checked. It took hours it seemed. Karen, pale and weak from her ever-increasing burden, yet as gentle, courageous and full of faith as always, was helped along by her devoted husband, Christen, while the newlywedded couples, with the little girls in tow, came next in line. Someone began blowing on a mouth organ, as they moved along, the tune to “Come, Come Ye Saints”, and a number took up the refrain including some of the Christensens, — “And should we die before our journey’s through, happy day, all is well. We then are free from toil and sorrow too, with the just we shall dwell. And if —” everyone was hurried along and the song ceased.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was a great job getting everyone on board, especially with so many children. By 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon, nevertheless, all the emigrants there were on the ship waiting to leave the city of Aalborg. Some stood near the railing of the upper deck, shouting and waving hands and handkerchiefs shoreward in goodbyes. Else too paused there a moment, and turned to peer anxiously and longingly among the crowd left on shore for one familiar face of her youth - but she recognized no one. She wiped her eyes, and Laurs stole an arm around her shoulder and smiled sideways at her, as her <span id="page-174"></span> father had been wont to do. Then he said softly, “Is it then so bad Else?” When she made no answer he continued, trying to cheer her, — “Someday, when we have become rich and important in Zion, they will welcome you back to Thy with flags a-flying!” Dear, kind Laurs, thought Else sadly; even he could not fully understand. Ja, only those who had packed their bags and gone away from their very own forever could know the heartbreak of it. So she said her own goodbyes within herself and then, like “Ruth of Old”, she looked back no more but turned and followed her husband’s mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the first shudder of the ship excitement on board exploded and many hastened to wave goodbye again. It was about 5:00 o’clock late afternoon of 16 May 1866, when the “Dania”, with its happy cargo, was finally lifted upon the breast of the Limfjord and set sail eastward toward the Kattegat Sea, headed for Copenhagen.</p>
