  <p class="calibre1">(58) Cullen Yates Christensen (4) was born in Manti, Sanpete, Utah 8 May 1921. When he was a baby he suffered a lot with eczema. His face was often dobbed up with a soothing, smelly yellow salve. If he ate eggs he got hives, his tongue would thicken and his eyes almost swell shut at times. This was rather disconcerting to Mother Myrtle, a food specialist and dietition of some experience, who tried to raise him with the most scientific care. He was the best-taken-care-of-baby  one could imagine. He also had a number of brothers and sisters in the home to help spoil him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christmas Cullen was a year and a half, I was home from school at Provo for the holidays. My fiance had given me a ten pound box of chocolates  and after passing it around a time or two I placed it in my dresser drawer upstairs for safe keeping. Every time I went upstairs when Cullen was awake I would hear the thump- thump- thumping of his little knees as he came crawling quickly up the stairs behind me. “Canny, Ninny, canny” he could barely say it, yet with his baby hands eagerly extended I knew well what he wanted. And who could resist? Not I! Together he and I ate a big share of that whole ten pound box of chocolates in those ten days. I’m pretty sure Mother Myrtle had no idea about Cullen’s part in it, yet this doubtless  aggravated his sensitive skin condition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">While he was still in the “diaper stage” his grandfather Christensen used to take him on short walks up and down the sidewalk or around the block. Cullen often wore little black sateen rompers with a large yellow cloth cat face appliqued on front. Hand in hand he and grandfather would toddle along, for the old man’s legs were rather short and getting stiff and he was also built on a rather wide  track - like the diapered baby. But Cullen’s short legs  grew long in time and the rest of him also grew, and despite his early digestive problems he turned out to be the tallest of A. H. Christensen’s four sons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was a few months past four when the family moved to Provo and then later to Orem. It was in Orem that he attended school through the grades and high school. He graduated from Lincoln <span id="page-920"></span> High School there the spring of 1938 as valedictorian of his class. He was a talented boy, a fine student and a great reader. He had a beautiful baritone voice, was good at basketball; in fact most anything he put his mind to he could do well. Of course he had plenty of work to do on the small fruit farm where the family lived, but he found time to fish and hunt as a boy - and these he loved to do and still does to this day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen writes about those early days in Orem:- “My most vivid recollections of Dad are associated with the home in Orem, the fishing and hunting trips, the family outings, Christmas, and the law business. I believe Dad really loved that place in Orem. He always arose early and did a half day’s work before going to the office. I never could join him in his obvious love for horses and sheep he kept on the place. Those horses ate constantly  and I doubt if he ever rode one. He seemed to enjoy just watching them and perhaps recalling his early days in Gunnison and Manti.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My first recollection of fishing was with Dad at Fish Lake and Strawberry, particularly Charlie Madsen’s camp at Strawberry. I can still see the smile on Dad’s face when he would bring out a nice native trout on the big pop-gear.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Sunday afternoon picnics at Canyon Glen and Aspen Grove were great. Mother would always have such good food and Dad did enjoy games with us children. Of course Christmas Eve when all the family would gather was the greatest! Each would perform in turn and Dad would enjoy every minute of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mother was always thinking of others and doing something for someone else. Maybe she got more enjoyment out of that than doing things for herself. I truly believe that I was blessed with the finest parents on earth.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen was popular with the girls at Lincoln High School but he had found a favorite in Daryl Stewart, a tall, slender, pretty, dark haired miss. And Daryl liked Cullen but her mother objected to her going steady. His parents seemed to be of the same opinion so the two didn’t go steady but they <span id="page-921"></span> dated quite often nevertheless. The summer after high school graduation Cullen went out of state to work on a ranch. Daryl worked at Parks Cafe in Orem and found that there were other young men interested in her, one in particular who was very persuasive. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen attended BYU the following winter and since Daryl seemed unavailable for dating their paths seldom crossed. The next summer he went with his brother Phil to Tulsa, Wyoming and worked for the McGinnis Livestock Company, and Phil tells something of this:- “I drove my old Austin up to Wyoming in the summer of 1940 to work for the livestock company again. As I recall Cullen, my younger brother, Warren Tanner and Gus Keele went with me to work on the ranch. Cullen, Warren and Gus were all pretty good sized and I, of course, had then reached a pretty mature stature myself, although I think I was smaller than the others. When we finished our work on the ranch that fall we went up to Yellowstone Park. We had no place to stay and we spent one of the coldest nights I ever recall, all four of us trying to sleep in that little old Austin. But we had a nice trip nevertheless. I don’t remember how much money we were able to save from the work up there but it was not a great deal, though it did help a little getting started in school again.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen attended BYU that winter. Daryl married  Richard Hamilton Sparks that same winter. After his two years at BYU Cullen went back to Washington D.C. and studied law at the George Washington University. To make his way he was also employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its Washington office. Here he remained from the fall of 1941 until Aug. 1944, when he was drafted inte the army, since World War II was on. He trained first in Texas and then Maryland and became a special agent in the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). He was sent to serve in Japan but arrived there just as the war ended in 1945. However, he remained in Japan with the forces of occupation until 1946.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Daryl was having marital problems  and was in the process of securing a separation <span id="page-922"></span> from her husband. One day she ran across Cullen’s sister Norma on the street and, stopping to inquire about Cullen, learned that he was on his way home, she said casually, “Tell him to look me up when he comes - I’d love to see him.” And look her up he did and their friendship of high school days was soon renewed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen and Daryl Aldene Stewart (Sparks) were married 23 Oct. 1946 at her parents’ home in Provo. Cullen’s father performed the ceremony  in the presence of members of the two families. Cullen comments on this:- “The only time I can ever recall Dad being flustered was when he was performing the marriage ceremony for Daryl and me. He kept getting his notes turned upside down. What a precious moment to remember!” A wedding dinner was given later in honor of the bride and groom at a party house in Orem, with members of both families present. Daryl was an only child, having been born 16 Oct. 1921 in Salt Lake City, Utah to Allen Glover and Martha Ellison Stewart. She had two sons by her first husband: Richard, almost five at the time of this second marriage, and Robert, two and a half. Cullen adopted these two boys soon after and they took the Christensen name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Immediately after their marriage the couple left for Washington D. C. where Cullen resumed his study of law at George Washington University as well as his position in the office of the F.B.I. It was arranged that after they were duly settled there, his sister Norma would fly back with the two little boys. And this Norma did - and she tells about it:- “A most promising opportunity appeared on the horizon when Cullen and Daryl accepted my offer to fly back to Washington D. C. with their two boys. I planned to work for a while in the nation’s capitol, at least until my sweetheart, Reed, was out of the army and we could make more realistic plans for the future. For a final outing of skiing prior to my leaving, I borrowed some ill-fitting boots which literally became my downfall. On an innocent-appearing slope my inside runner dug in and I found myself cartwheeling  into a snowy heap, my right leg twisted <span id="page-923"></span> into an odd and painful position… Later, with a walker heel attached to my cast, I was able to walk.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our flight to Washington was a chore, to put it mildly, beginning at 2:30 a.m, 18 Feb. 1947. However, the most difficult part came after we arrived, In my ‘unhandy’ condition we were the last ones off the plane, thereby missing Cullen’s page for us over the loud speaker. Having received no response, Cullen and Daryl checked the time of arrival of the next flight and spent the interval gaily window shopping, having lunch, etc. Meanwhile,  back at the terminal we were experiencing almost complete despair. My efforts to make contact  by phone were of course fruitless and the boys were so tired from our almost sleepless night that they were completely unmanageable. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity and to my indescribable relief, the parents of my charges appeared. Whew! That was my somewhat unpleasant introduction  to five fabulous months in Washington D.C., the first four weeks of which were spent housebound with my newest sister-in-law, because of my cast. But this provided us an opportunity to get acquainted and in no time at all I became convinced that my brother Cullen was the luckiest man I knew.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cullen graduated from George Washington University Law School with an LLB degree in 1948 and the family returned to Provo, Utah. He was admitted to the Utah State Bar in 1949 and joined his father and two older brothers in their law firm there. He has been a practicing attorney since that time to the present in Provo, with the exception  of a period (1951-52) spent again as special agent, U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps, during the Korean War.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Daryl and Cullen eventually built a beautiful home on Canyon Road in North Provo where they  reside. They both find time to play golf and Cullen to go fishing and hunting. Attending conventions all over the country is also a part of their life together, for Cullen has served as president of a number of local civic clubs and organizations as well as president of the Utah State Bar. He sought his first political office in this last presidential  election (1968) when he ran as a candidate <span id="page-924"></span> for Judge of the Fourth Judicial District - but he was defeated. Among a few of the credentials listed on his campaign literature were  these: - “Current President of Utah State Bar Association; Utah County Bar Association (past president); American Bar Association; American College of Probate Counsel (Utah State Chairman); Provo Rotary Club (past president); Past President Provo Jaycees; Provo Chamber of Commerce (Past Director); Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Provo; Utah Valley Opera Association (Past Director); Past President of Riverside Country Club; Member of LDS Church.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fundamentally, the processes of the law mean a great deal to Cullen and he came by this naturally, since it was sorta “born and bred in him” as it were. I remember hearing of the time when he was taking his first turns at driving the family car. He was driving Father home from Salt Lake City late one night. They were alone and Father was in the back seat, presumably asleep. Cullen began speeding and the siren of an alert highway patrolman made him well aware of it. He pulled off the highway and slowed to a stop and the patrolman was soon questioning him rather bruskly. Cullen squirmed under his gaze and glanced hopefully in Father’s direction but the older man never moved or spoke. Cullen was on his own with his accuser and Father allowed him to suffer the full impact of breaking the law.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, Cullen learned first hand to respect the law by counsel and example, for his father believed in and lived it to the fullest. Cullen writes of him in this regard:- “While my association with Dad at the office was not nearly long enough, I know he was a great lawyer. Older members of the Bar still comment on his integrity and hard work. The law was really his life. Perhaps so much so that in his declining years he was unable to find real interest in anything else. Near the end, I can still see him sitting at his desk, moving papers around, and acting like an old war horse who would like to do battle just one more time.”</p>
