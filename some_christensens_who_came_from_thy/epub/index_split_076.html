  <h2 id="everett-hale-christensen" class="calibre9">Everett Hale Christensen</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(30) Everett Hale Christensen (4) was born 12 Mar. 1907 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He was named and blessed 2 June 1907 by Niels R. Petersen;  baptized 31 Aug. 1915 by Andrew Christensen (no relation); confirmed the same day by Andrew Thomson Jr. and ordained a Deacon 8 Nov. 1920 by Joseph H. Carpenter - all in Manti.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I remember him as a round faced, tow headed little fellow whose hair was rather hard to manage - a typical Christensen youngster, who grew to look more like our father than any other of his sons, though never quite as tall. He was more modest than us other children and had such a sweet, gentle disposition. He was so easy to get along with and I always had a motherly feeling towards him and tried to take his part in the little family squabbles that inevitably take place among children, even in the best of households.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We catch glimpses of him as a lad between his fourth and eighth years, as mother saw him, for she jotted these accounts down in her journal:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sunday morning Aug. 20, 1911 - I was sitting out on the porch a few moments ago watching Sherman and Hale. They were by the fence gathering  the pink hollyhocks. Hale had on his little white suit and their white heads looked beautiful to me <span id="page-805"></span> there among the flowers… Sep. 18, 1911 - School  starts this morning. Hale and I are alone. He has on his little yellow suit which looks just the color of his hair… Oct. 18, 1911 - Hale is off somewhere playing. Well, it is good that he can be gathering some of the gold from this lovely October weather to last him through the short, dark winter days… June 19, 1912 - Just got through making Hale a waist, and Hale and Sherman have been worrying me about making them some flags. (Hale went off without his flag)… Across the road I see Hale leading Reid’s dog. Lucian is playing the drum and they are all singing. I know that Sherman is just outside longing for his flag so that he can join them in their parade… July 8, 1912 - I just got through making a cake. Sherman and Hale went to the grocery for the bananas. I emptied the mixing bowl and there ensued a wrangle between them over which was going to scrape the bowl. I had to draw a line through the center and each took a side of the bowl to scrape as they sat on the floor. ‘Don’t pound the bowl, Hale!’… Nov. 18, 1912 - There the children lie, Sherman with his feet in Hale’s side; Hale with his little red face and tangled white hair. The children take almost every moment of the day. Hale has been so trying. He lets out some of the biggest yells for a little fellow lever heard. I suppose the passing years will lend luster to those yells which now annoy me and turn them to music. May 16, 1913 - A show of great importance is taking place at Margaret’s this afternoon. Hale, delighted with the prospects of being an actor, hastened through his dinner. Five minutes ago he came aimlessly walking home. ‘Why Hale, why aren’t you over at the show?’ I asked. ‘I won’t be in it,’ he said. ‘They dressed me up like a girl and were going to make me be the cook. The dress was ugly, with a yellow string on it’. He stands here now. ‘There they go’ he just said. ‘All the kids are going. That’s Arthur running across now. They think it’s such a grand show, but they just have a little stubby tent!’ (This with great  disdain)… Sherman, at the show, is dressed like a Captain, while Reva, Virginia and Elaine have their dancing dresses on, Hale absolutely refuses <span id="page-806"></span> to go over. I just gave him an egg to spend if he would go over to Uncle Fred’s store and get me a spool of thread… May 17, 1914 - The water was running down badly and filling the hollow just south of the apricot tree. I told Hale I would give him an egg if he would go up to the corner and turn it off. Sherman said he would. They both went, as did Phil. They each took an egg and went to the Sugar Bowl to buy candy… Here they are now, happy with their purchases. They are treating me with candy.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale was nine years and four-and-a-half months old when Mother died. After that, although Aunt Vena, then Aunt Retta, then others came to help in the home and finally Aunt Myrtle as a second mother, yet he spent as much time as possible with his father and on the various  ranches - Gunnison, Flat Canyon and Star (for a short time). He took responsibility readily and was a hard worker and most dependable with the farm work. Yet his mind seemed of a mechanical bent and he became particularly interested in radio. Bert Gledhill, once a foreman on the Gunnison ranch, remembers Hale’s aerial wires and antennas being strung in every direction there on the ranch, from the farmhouse to the granary and even to one of the big barns, as he experimented with electromagnetic waves.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I recall spending part of New Years Eve with Hale in the “Buff Room” upstairs in our home in Manti the year end following my marriage (1923). A radio he had constructed was set up in the east window with wires going every which way both inside and out. He tried to explain to me the principles upon which it worked and we took turns wearing the attached ear phones, as he tuned into the festivities in New York, Chicago and other distant cities as the New Year arrived there. I had never experienced radio before and to me it seemed like a miracle. Hale had great ambitions along this line.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After the family moved to Orem and he graduated  from High School, Father then being in the midst of a financial struggle, Hale got employment with a General Land Office survey, Ralph Gentry <span id="page-807"></span> engineer. Though Father wanted him to start college the next winter, Hale, always most considerate  and mindful of Father and others, decided against it, as excerpts from some of his letters at that period show:— “Kamas, Sept. 24, ‘27 - Dear Dad: Just a line to let you know I’m all right. We are going to move from here on the first of October, maybe sooner if the snow drives us out. I suppose our next camp will be in the Ophir country. Two of the fellows have quit… Ophir, Ut. Oct.  28, ‘27 - Dear Dad: I have been keeping notes on the rear end of the chain for the last month and am doing all right. The work gets tiresome at times, but I suppose it’s all for the best. I must try to save enough money this year to buy me some clothes and to start my radio business going. I want so much to help out all I can… I’m not going to school this year Dad. I am going to build radio sets, etc. I will not have to carry any overhead expense, just keep enough parts on hand to fill orders. In addition to this I am going to take a drafting course from the American School. This is a complete course in general drafting. Then they give you a specialized course in one of five branches, mechanical, architectural, structural, electronic or automobile drafting, and guarantee you a job on completion of the course. It looks like a good layout and I know I can make it. What do you think of it?”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though father thought that Hale would have done better to have entered school, he did not. He came home in time for the holiday season in Orem and began taking an interest in some of the young people there, although his heart was set on a girl in Manti with whom he had kept company before leaving there. He corresponded with Ada regularly and began to think some of marriage. Sherman, himself married and away attending law school in Washington, D. C., encouraged him in this but Father, though he didn’t say much about it to Hale since it was his habit to let his children make their own decisions as they grew older, felt that he would be better off to get as well prepared as possible for his life’s work beforehand. In a letter to Sherman dated Mar. 4, 1928, Father wrote, “I don’t know just what Hale will do this summer. He talks like <span id="page-808"></span> he intends to go on the survey again. If he does I want to be able to help him out so that he can go to school next year. I believe I will encourage him to go to Logan and take an engineering course. He is taking a course by correspondence in drafting but he is working at that under quite a disadvantage. He will do fine in his line if he can get well prepared. I am going to make every effort to have him take a complete course so that he can get where he would like to.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale’s drafting outfit came and he tried to keep more or less employed with that during the winter. He also advertized as having a “parts installing service” and “radio sets” and got a little business along that line. As spring approached he helped on the place, pruning the trees, etc. His twenty-first birthday, Mar, 12, 1928, was celebrated  by a supper prepared by Aunt Myrtle in her usual efficient manner and attended by several of his young men friends. But he did not seem entirely satisfied with life and wanted to “reach out” for something better. Nevertheless he didn’t complain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among the letters Hale wrote at that time was one dated Mar. 20, 1928 to his brother Sherman. From this we quote:- “It’s a beautiful spring morning… Things are coming along all right on the farm; lots of work as you may know. We haven’t started to put the crops in as yet but we are preparing the land for same in husbandlike manner. Things are surely getting beautiful around these parts, everything getting green, and ummmm - spring is in the air (as everything and everybody is hauling manure).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I went into town last night with Waldo Harris and his brother. On the way home we ran out of gas and had to push the big Studabaker up the last hill and last lap. Waldo walked home with me and as luck would have it we met a couple of Provo girls I knew and they had underestimated their supply of the midnight oil also. But after looking into the tank we found plenty of the said necessary gasoline and proceeded to play mechanics on their Chevrolet. We had much trouble in agreeing as to the ailment of the lemon. Waldo tore into the gas line and I into the ignition and very soon we had all the loose <span id="page-809"></span> parts on the car entirely loosened and thrown off to the side. Oh, how we worked - without any success. Finally, as an afterthought, we deemed it a good idea to put the car together again. Oy yoy yoy! It just couldn’t be done - too many parts. However we did get things bolted on, etc., but it looked like a very untidy trash pile instead of a car. After going as far as we had, we decided to play the gallant Romeos and began taking our walking and pushing exercises toward Provo. The rest is short. We hailed a car which acted as a tug. We then made our graceful exit - I hope.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Will you look up the requirements of taking the Civil Service examination for draftsman? Waldo and I are figuring on coming to Washington next fall. Waldo wants to take up law. We would like to start studying on something which would help us to find employment in Washington. I suppose  I’ll go surveying again this year if I can get out with Gentry. I have already got that hillish feeling. Love to all. Hale.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale wrote another letter to Sherman 5 Apr. 1928, from which we quote excerpts:- “All things in general are beginning to look like spring, and we are surely thankful as we have been having bum, windy weather for two months. The berries, peaches, apricots and cherries are beginning to bloom, making the valley look like a huge garden. The sweet smell of spring is in the air. This has its effects. Gives one the hankering to go to the mountains surveying. Yep, I want to go on the survey again this year. Took a little trip to Salt Lake last week to see Gentry. He advised me that the surveyors wouldn’t be going out until about the first of July. This is due to the government’s lack of funds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I am plugging along in my drafting and hope in the future to find my reward. Are there many ads in the Washington papers advertising for draftsman? I suppose, however, there will be a job for me as soon as I’m prepared. I wish I could do something to help Dad right now. Of course I am farming every day, which helps in the long run, but our finances at present although not the worst could be better. They are bound to be afterwhile. <span id="page-810"></span> Things get discouraging at times but I suppose I shouldn’t kick as Dad bears the brunt of everything.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Besides working on the farm and around the place that spring, Hale worked at the Cold Packing Plant in Orem going on shift from before noon to nearly midnight. He was doing all he could to help out. On the farm he often sang at his work. He had a beautiful high tenor voice and was a member of a male quartet in the community. He loved music and the other arts - the finer things of life. He loved people, animals, and of course the beauties of nature. And he loved life, being on the threshhold of full manhood. What a pity when such a one is cut down in the midst of such promise and hope for the future.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That very spring Hale began ailing, as a letter from Father written June 26, 1928 advises:- “We are all well excepting Hale. I had him to Salt Lake a few days last week trying to find out the matter. The x-ray expert took a number of pictures but thus far we have not been satisfied as to what is the trouble, which seems to be in his bowels. I am taking him up there again in the morning. We do not wish to operate until we discover the trouble if possible from the outside. It is quite a worry and the poor boy is about discouraged. Gentry called him the other day and wanted him to go out with his party but of course he couldn’t. Gentry said, however, that he would hold a job open for him for a month or two. We are hoping for the best,”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale failed to improve. An operation July 30, 1928, though quite serious did not reveal an expected growth in the large intestines yet it was a great shock to his system. His condition gave much cause for concern. Though he was able to return home from the hospital at that time and seemed to feel some better yet he was in constant pain and had a very hard time of it. He took some treatments to stimulate the nerves controlling the colon activity, where the trouble seemed to be located, and did all else that the doctors thought might help. Nothing helped and he was operated on again, Oct. 15, 1928 in the Salt Lake LDS Hospital, requiring blood transfusions because of his frail condition. <span id="page-811"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">They found that part of his large intestine had become enmeshed with a large, hard growth almost completely closing it off. Much inflamation  had occurred which had affected some of the small intestines. He suffered most severe pain. The doctors had to leave part of the large intestine on the outside so that the affected part could sluff off, and also leave his side open so that it could drain. Later the large intestine was opened so that it could drain through the side of the abdomen. Though this brought some improvement and hope, it was only temporary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale wrote what is thought to be his last letter, lying on his back in bed in the hospital where he was suffering terribly. This is the  letter:- “Dec. 13, 1928 - Dearest Dad in all the world: Today is your birthday and I wish you all the happiness and joy in the world, Oh, I am thankful for a father like you even if I haven’t shown it. It’s been my ambition to become as big and respected a man as you are; always thinking of others, sacrificing, bringing joy wherever you go. Words cannot express how I feel and my love for you.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I hope you are all over your cold and feeling fine. And I hope you have been successful in your cases. I have been feeling better lately and my spirits are high. Well, dear Dad, give my love to Aunt Myrtle and the children and everybody. Daddy I love you, Your loving son - Hale.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In a letter to Sherman Dec. 24, 1928, Father told of preparations for Hale’s last  Christmas:- “Aunt Myrtle and I came up Saturday to do what we could to give Hale a little Christmas cheer. Aunt Myrtle went home yesterday and I will go home today and we will all come up to see him tomorrow. The folks here are all doing what they can to cheer him. Some young people, girls and boys from the Bench, came up yesterday and brought him a beautiful bouquet of roses, and other tokens. Gentry also came and spent some  time with him and brought him a present. Aunt Retta and family brought a beautiful Christmas tree all decorated. And so with these and other . flowers and presents coming in, his room has been <span id="page-812"></span> given a real Christmas appearance. The folks here will bring presents this evening and try to give Hale as pleasant a Christmas Eve as possible. We should like to be here, but Hale wants us to have our usual Christmas Eve at home for the children’s sake. He says he will certainly be there in thoughts, and then we will come up tomorrow, children and all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Hale has been the most wonderful spirit through all this long suffering and still keeps his sweet disposition. He is a favorite and the nurses all really love him and seek to do everything for him possible… The awful reality of his not being able to get well is forcing itself upon us in spite of our great hopes and constant prayers. I feel that Hale too realizes the situation and is making a valiant fight to keep us hoping and to save us from the terrible shock… If ever a man has proved himself worthy of the highest respect and admiration  under the most trying conditions and suffering, that one is our Hale. And through it all it has seemed that his greatest concern has been for us… Well, if he must go, his young life and character will be an inspiration to all of us to achieve nobility of character and real success. I always thought that Hale had the making of a fine man, and the test that has come to him has proved him worthy of a place among the glorified.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sherman came from Washington shortly after the holidays and spent a week with Hale. It was a reunion and a farewell for two devoted brothers, with smiles hiding heartbreak, one on the threshold of full manhood and success - the other smitten and wilting in his hospital bed. When and where are decisions of such distinction made?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cancer is a vicious and unmerciful foe. Hale suffered on, as revealed in others of father’s letters written at intervals to Sherman:- “Jan, 29, 1929 - I just came from the hospital where I have been visiting Hale all day. The wonderful fight he is making must challenge our admiration and we can hardly think of him losing the fight. Dr. Andrew said tonight he is a most wonderful patient and it is almost more than he as a doctor can stand to see Hale so courageous and find himself helpless to help him… Feb, 13 - Hale is in very great <span id="page-813"></span> distress. It seems like the poor, dear boy must suffer all the torture that a human being can endure. Gentry was up here this evening but Hale couldn’t talk to him; he was under the influence of morphine. We are doing everything we can for him but it is very little we can do it seems… Feb. 20 - We are all well with the exception of Hale. He is very poorly, having much pain and is getting very weak. He has eaten scarcely anything for three weeks. Still he is that gentle, loving, appreciative soul, scarcely ever complaining evenin his pain. Feb. 25 - I have been here with Hale the greater part of this week. The way he has acted during this terrible sickness has not only been a wonder but a great inspiration. While my heart bleeds for him continually, I cannot help but be most proud of him.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hale passed away the morning of Mar. 9, 1929. A letter written that same day by his brother Phillip to loved ones in Washington D. C. is quoted here:- “It’s a wonderful brother that is gone to a better world. I am thankful that I have had the opportunity and blessing of knowing him as I have. It will help me be a much better person. He would have made a wonderful person to carry on our work here… I’m no flowery writer but I surely feel that Hale is filling a purpose by doing what he has done. I feel that back in the other world Hale volunteered to do this thing that he has done for some deep object and that his age enabled him to see it through…”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And Father wrote:- “Hale’s was a wonderful struggle to win health again, but it could not be.  While my judgment had been convinced for some time that he could not recover, my feelings remained unconvinced to the last day. But his last day’s struggle was such that I could not desire him to continue the fight longer. He remained conscious  until about the last, although his fever was about up to 107 and he had been given about 28 grains of morphine during the last day and night.  Hale was a real hero through it all and while I should gladly have given what was left of my days to have him spared, yet I feel a comfort and pride in the way he bore his cross throughout this terrible <span id="page-814"></span> ordeal… That boy has shown himself worthy to a glorious place on the other side… He will be another there whose spirit will plan and pray for our welfare and will be happy to greet us when our work here is done. May it be as fearlessly and nobly done as his… I am sure Hale’s wonderful life, though short, will be an aid and inspiration to us all and another star of hope to guide us over any perilous places we may encounter along life’s highway. He will always occupy an honored place in our family group.” </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Funeral services were held for Hale on his twenty-second birthday, Tue. 12 Mar. 1929, beginning at high noon. A local newspaper carried this account:- “Orem Youth is Buried - Impressive funeral services for Hale Christensen, son of A. H. Christensen, who died Saturday morning were held in the Timpanogos Ward chapel Tuesday afternoon. Bishop James H. Clark presided. Miss Thera Lou Olsen and Mrs. S. D. Wilstead rendered the vocal duet ‘Prayer Perfect’ and the invocation was offered by M. A. Rowley. Miss Olsen sang ‘When Roses Bloom’. The speakers were J. B. Keeler, Hyrum S. Harris and Arthur V. Watkins. Miss Inez Holdaway and Miss Virginia Taylor furnished the vocal duet ‘One Fleeting Hour’ and the solo, ‘In My father’s House are Many Mansions’ was rendered by Miss Myrle Perkins. As a closing number a quartet consisting of Ivan Pyne, John Shepherd, Mrs. Daphne Loveless, and Mrs. Lucy Poulson sang ‘Rest for the Weary Soul’. James C. Jensen pronounced the benediction. The services were well attended and the floral tributes were many and beautiful. The body was taken to Manti where short services were held and interment made.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A number of friends and many of our Snow relatives accompanied our family from Orem to the Manti Cemetery, as well as Uncle Charles Peterson and Byron. We arrived there about 5:15 p.m. and although it was cold a good sized crowd was waiting at the graveside. We put our precious Hale away beside our dear mother in a wilderness of flowers. A chorus sang “Sometime We’ll Understand.” Our old neighbor, Brother Carpenter, made a few remarks. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ellis Johnson sang <span id="page-815"></span> “Beautiful Home” and a former close neighbor, Edgar T. Reid, dedicated the grave. What a host of friends Hale had. This was evident not only during his illness but at his funeral and burial as well. So many young people were in attendance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">None of Father’s brothers and sisters were present at the funeral or burial. Neither Aunt Vena or Aunt Elsie could be there. Uncle Andrew was in California and Aunt Sarah couldn’t come. Aunt Florence had been taken to the hospital again so Uncle Louis wasn’t there, and Uncle Arthur was working on a ranch somewhere and couldn’t be reached. Everyone there at the burial however was so wonderful to us. We stayed all night at Manti. Phil, Cullen and Mable slept at Reids. Father and Aunt Myrtle stayed with Aunt Millie at the Eagle House, while I stayed with  step-grandmother, Sorena, in the old home where both Grandmother and Grandfather Christensen had passed away. I seemed to feel their spirits there. I’m sure they were among those to welcome Hale on the other side.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">My conversation with Sorena was mostly about Grandfather’s last illness and suffering, for he had been gone but a few months. Then we talked of the life hereafter - and somehow we hit upon the subject of genealogy. I had never thought of this seriously before but that night I was struck with my responsibility in this matter’ I came away from Manti bearing Grandmother’s and Grandfather’s  Temple Record Book, together with a firm determination to seek out my dead progenitors and do something about them. And thus, with Hale’s death, there was born in me the spirit of Elijah. I did not know then that some thirty-two years hence I should be spared from a fate similar to this precious brother’s only by the miracle of modern medicine and a Divine Providence - spared as it were, or so it seems to me now, to work on our genealogy. Truly, “God moves in a mysterious way…”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Father, torn for a year after our beloved Hale’s death with nights of sleeplessness and days of remembering his suffering, went to the Salt Lake Temple the evening of Hale’s twenty-third <span id="page-816"></span> birthday, 12 Mar. 1930, together with Elaine and her husband Ted, and performed the holy endowment  ordinance for him. A serene peace came to Father after that, as far as the memory of Hale was concerned, knowing that he had done the last great earthly service for this dear, departed son.</p>
