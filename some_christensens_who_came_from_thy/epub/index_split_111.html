  <p class="calibre1">(65) LaMar Christensen Clark (9) Cousin LaMar called on me at my home in Provo Saturday 20 Mar. 1967 and gave the following short account of himself:- “I was born in Goshen, Utah County, Utah 14 Oct. 1928. I started school in Santaquin, first in elementary and then graduated from Jr. High there. I attended Payson High parts of three years but did not graduate, staying out of school at times when work was available. I got odd jobs with farmers, in the onion and potato harvests, etc., and herding cows.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His sister Tresia tells of one incident in his life:- “It was difficult for our father to keep our big family in shoes. Clothes could be made over or handed down - but shoes wore out. One time when LaMar was about twelve years old he was herding cows down by the canal and kicking his feet out over the stream as he sat resting on the bank. One of his oxfords came off and fell into the stream and he was unable to recover it. These were his only shoes. He was frightened and didn’t dare tell Father, but confided in me. He sluffed school for a number of days and went barefoot over to Salem and worked in the potato and onion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-962" title="962"></span> harvest until he had earned enough money to buy himself a new pair of shoes. Not until then did he tell Father or go back to school.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaMar continues his story:- “I learned the value of money early - and the hard way. I learned to work for the things I wanted. As soon as I could I got a job working at Ironton, just south of Provo, and when I was eighteen, in Nov. 1946, I started working for Geneva Steel of Provo in the open hearth department. I am still working there after more than twenty years, but I have had a number of advancements and am now a crane operator.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I met my wife, Georgina, when I was attending school in Payson. I was sixteen. Two school friends took me to her home in Nephi and introduced us. I was impressed and she must have been also, for we began going together right away. She was my first real ‘girl friend’. We went together much of the time for two and a half years and then were married, 1 June 1948, during a wedding party in our honor at her home ward church in Nephi. The marriage ceremony was performed about 10:00 p.m. by Bishop Brockbank.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We honeymooned in the canyons of southern Utah, then moved to a home at 355 East 4th North in Provo, where we rented an apartment. Later we bought a trailer house in Orem and lived there for about a year. It was while living in this trailer house the spring of 1949 that our first child, Nancy, was born in the Payson hospital. Next we sold our trailer and rented a home at 455 North 2nd West in Provo where we lived for three years. It was while living here that our second daughter, Marla, was born in the Provo hospital.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then we bought a home in American Fork at 950 West Main Street where we lived for about eight years. It was in the American Fork hospital that our last three children were born, another daughter and two sons. In the meantime we began buying a lot at 396 West 3rd North in American Fork and on this we had a nice three bedroom brick home built and moved into this, where we are very comfortable and happy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My hobbies and special interests are hunting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-963" title="963"></span> and fishing, golf, bowling, raising flowers and a vegetable garden (when there is room); also carpentry and do-it-yourself projects. Among other things I built the garage we had on our first American Fork place. I have become more active in the church recently and now go home teaching. We like our ward here.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As I looked at this gentle, sweet dispositioned young man in his late thirties, light complexioned with curly hair beginning to recede a little, I thought how much like his grandfather Christensen he was. Rather short but sturdily built; yes, he was his grandfather’s boy. I thought also that here was a self-made successful man who was gathering the good things of life around him - a fine home, a nice car, a lovely family, and conveniences to make them happy. He was finding time to work in the church and to indulge some of his many hobbies, along with his family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">LaMar took up a new hobby. He bought himself a motorcycle. On Sunday July 28, 1968, after dinner, he felt a little under the weather and decided to take a little ride to get some air. He got on his motorcycle and headed toward Alpine. Sometime later his machine struck a railroad track and he was thrown off onto his head. He was rushed to a nearby Murray hospital and his family was summoned. But he never regained consciousness and died that night about 9 p.m, in the hospital there. Funeral services were held for him in the American Fork Third Ward chapel the following Thursday at 1l a.m. and he was buried in the Nephi, Utah cemetery beside some of his wife’s people.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His wife, Georgina Ockey, was born 17 Apr. 1929, in Nephi, Juab, Utah, the daughter of Edward Burton and Ida Ann Wilkey Ockey. She and their five children survived him, as well as one brother and four sisters.</p>
