  <p class="calibre1">(56) Alta Clark (9) was born 2 Feb. 1921 at the home of her Uncle and Aunt Charles and Emma Peterson, who lived on a ranch about one mile east of Gunnison in Sanpete County, Utah. As long as her Aunt Emma lived Alta was a favorite of hers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alta spent about the first two years of her life with her family, living in the small farmhouse on her Uncle Albert’s ranch some west of Gunnison, where her father was ranch foreman. Then they moved to Goshen, Utah, She says, “I went to elementary school in Goshen until I was nearing the end of third grade, 1 May 1930, when we moved to Santaquin, Utah. Here I finished elementary  school and Junior High and then went by bus to Payson for two years of High School. I never went the last year or graduated, for by that time I had learned the thrill of earning a little <span id="page-916"></span> money of my own. Money was so scarce at home and we had a big family. Up until this time I had worked around a little doing odd jobs after school and Saturdays and picked berries on Provo Bench (Orem) for Parks in summer and in the beans in the fall - anywhere to make a little cash.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then about 1938/39 I went to Salt Lake City and got jobs doing housework for various families. I returned home for awhile during 1942 but later returned to Salt Lake and continued doing the same kind of work there until about 1947. Then I started sewing for a living and went to work for the Hollywood  Corset Company, making lingerie, etc. I worked for them for nine years, or until about 1956 when they were forced to close up. Then I got a job sewing for the Osborn Manufacturing Company in Salt Lake where they make Pendleton shirts, coats, etc., and other name-brand clothing of all kinds. I am still working here at present.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 11 June 1955 in Elko, Nevada I married John Francis Ison (b. 12 Apr. 1921 in Salt Lake City to Jerry C. and Eliza Robinson Ison). We met through friends and he was a roofer by trade. After many years we separated by mutual consent, although we are not divorced and still see each other occasionally. I have one son, Terry Thomas, who has served his turn in the army and is now married and living in Santaquin. He married a divorcee with two young children, David and Debbie Rich, whom he has not yet officially adopted but is raising.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I love a friendly game of cards. Besides pinochle, my main hobbies are sewing, hand work and especially bowling. I belong to the Osborn Bowling team and in 1965 I won two trophies, one for my individual high game of 253, at which time they put my picture in a Salt Lake paper, and the other a team trophy. I have lived around in various rented apartments since moving to Salt Lake City but now rent one part of a duplex at 482 - 4th Ave., where I am very comfortable.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alta’s niece Karen says she is a very “fussy” housekeeper and a beautiful seamstress. We find her to have many of her mother’s fine characteristics,  so sweet, loving, pleasant, good natured <span id="page-917"></span> and easy to get along with; kind and appreciative of others and all around good hearted. Alta is also a fine letter writer. She is rather jovial in disposition although very, very modest - and especially shy around strangers. She has a great love for her brothers and sisters and their families and stays rather close to those who live near her. She usually spends Christmas at Tresia’s and arrives there not long after Santa has left, early Christmas mornings, often waking them up and bringing bundles of good cheer. Her nieces and nephews love her. She was especially close to her sister Lorraine whose recent death was a great blow to her.</p>
