  <h2 id="emma-eliza-christensen-peterson" class="calibre9">EMMA ELIZA CHRISTENSEN (PETERSON)</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Emma was born Sun. 18 July 1877 in the new home in South Mayfield recently acquired by her parents, Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen, following their leaving of the United Order experiment on Mayfield’s north side. She was the seventh child and second daughter of the couple, although the sixth producing branch of their family tree. When she was nearing two years of age her mother went to Salt Lake City for six weeks to study medicine, leaving her in charge of her father and a Sister Anderson who came into the home to assist with the household and the six children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just about the time Emma turned three the family moved back to Gunnison where they had lived before Emma was born. This time they settled in a little adobe home in east Gunnison belonging to Emma’s Uncle, Lars Myrup, but they spent the next several summers living in<span id="page-593"></span>  Christenburg, a small farming community midway between Mayfield and Gunnison, where the father leased a farm from Julius Christensen (no relation). In the meantime her father bought a place of his own in northwest Gunnison on which stood an old two-roomed adobe house, and here the family took up their residence in winters for a while - the family now numbering seven living children and the parents. In time a new rock house was built on their property very near to the old house and both houses were used by the family for a time. The old two-roomed adobe is long since gone but the rock house is still standing (1969) on the corner of Second West and First North in Gunnison. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Emma was blessed 4 Oct, 1877 in Mayfield by Bishop Ole C. Olsen. She was baptized 2 June 1886 in the San Pitch River some distance from their new rock house in Gunnison, by Peter Peterson and confirmed the next day, Sun. 3 June 1886 in the church near their home, by C. L. Hansen. Emma and all of her older brothers and sisters were re-baptized 1 Apr. 1893, when many of the Saints in Gunnison rededicated their lives and purposes to the Lord. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">Emma attended the Gunnison District school which was held not far from her home until she graduated from eighth grade. No High School was then available to her, so she found work in the O. B. Berglund store in Gunnison and worked there for some time. Emma was thirteen when her mother went back to Denmark to see her people in 1890 and she took a big part in helping to keep the home running smoothly the three months her mother was away. In fact, she had been given responsibilities in the home very early since her mother was a medical doctor-nurse in the area and much in demand outside the home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Emma’s parents encouraged her to continue her schooling however, so the winter of 1894/95 she attended the Brigham Young Academy in Provo, where her older sister Elsie and most of her older brothers advanced their educations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She attended B. Y. A. until she could qualify as a school teacher and then taught in Spring City,<span id="page-594"></span> Gunnison, and then in Axtell for two winters (1899-1901). Cousin Lillian J, Peterson remembers that Emma lived at their home in Axtell during those two winters and that the last winter, when she herself was five, Emma took her to school with her. She writes: - ‘Cousin Emma was my first school teacher and I can remember very well that we walked a mile to school. The first words I wrote she hugged and kissed me right in the school room; it seems like it was just yesterday.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After that Emma taught in Fayette, some six miles north of Gunnison, and likely taught there two years also. It seems that it was during that time that she began to be seriously courted by a young Swede named Charles Peter Peterson of Gunnison. Emma was a very pretty girl with dark hair and dark blue eyes, being the only real dark haired child in the Christensen family. She had rosy cheeks and a natural high coloring to her fair skin. She was rather tall in stature and possessed a sweet, loving, gentle disposition very much like that of her father; yet she was very “outgoing” like her mother and so eager to help and please.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles was tall, dark, slender and handsome. He also had a very gentle and understanding nature, although he was quite a tease. He and Emma made a very nice looking couple. Tresia remembers that “Charlie” courted Emma in a fine one-horse rig and brought her boxes of chocolates which she stashed away in her bureau drawer where Tresia and Vena, like little mice, got into them. But Charles had one big drawback which loomed high in Emma’s mind. He was not a member of the church and some of his people were even real bitter towards it. But real love conquers all. In time Charles qualified to join the LDS Church and on Wed. 30 Sept. 1903 he took her in his fancy rig to the Manti Temple and they were wed. He was eleven months and two days younger than Emma, being then twenty-five, while she was twenty-six. But for nearly one month every late spring they were of the same age.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following a wedding party held the night of their wedding, at her parents’ home, Charles took Emma to live in the home he had on his Bar CC</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-58"><span id="page-594a"></span> <img alt="Emma and Charles" src="58.png" class="calibre7"/><p>Emma and Charles Peterson by their ranch home east of Gunnison</p>
</div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-595"></span> ranch, just east of Gunnison. Their son Byron and his wife Mildred have collaborated on a short history of Emma’s life and from it we now quote:—“This was the beginning of a busy and eventful life for Emma, rearing her family and supporting the activities of an ambitious farmer and stockraiser. Emma had three children, Byron, Ada and Imelda, whom she reared to maturity but she lost two little girls who were stillborn between Ada and Imelda. Ada remembers how beautiful the one little sister was as she lay in her box-coffin - like a big doll asleep. Charles buried each of the little stillborn babies on their ranch just across the wash from their house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“While the menfolks and hired hands were busily engaged in the fields and on the range, Emma milked many cows and made and sold pounds of delicious butter. She hauled barrels of good water for drinking and carried hundreds of bucketsful from the creek for washing and other purposes. She raised chickens, turkeys, pigs and geese. Byron says, ‘I often remember in my childhood seeing geese, who had waddled way up onto the hill above the house, sailing past the kitchen window as they made a flying landing in the back dooryard.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There is always the fond memory of Grandpa and Grandma Christensen coming to our house. How Grandmother enjoyed having Mother Emma brush and comb her hair. It was such a beautiful head of waist-length auburn hair and she wore it in braids that were fashioned into a bob on top her head. Sometimes Grandmother would ask if we had a ‘runty pig’, referring of course to a baby pig who wasn’t doing so well. Father always seemed to have a ‘runty pig’ when grandmother desired one. She seemed to have a special talent and pride in getting these little pigs all plumped up and doing fine in scarcely no time at all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Aunt Elvena was a very kind and helpful sister in Emma’s home during her child rearing years, helping to both care for and ‘spoil’ Emma’s children, or so Emma said. In later years, after Vena was married, Emma was able to return the favors - somewhat. Vena’s second child, Alta,<span id="page-596"></span> was born at the Peterson home and when the third child, Tresia, was born in the farm house on the Albert Christensen farm west of Gunnison where Vena and George were living, Emma took care of little Alta at her home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Often, during her leisure hours, Emma would hitch the horse to the buggy and, taking the children along, go to visit Vena at the Gunnison ranch, or Arthur and Millie, Louis and Florence, Chris and Caroline, or Elsie and Alma, in Gunnison and even Grandpa and Grandma in Manti.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1918 Charles and Emma bought their first car which was known as the ‘Big 4 Overland’. One day enroute to Manti to visit Grandfather and Grandmother Christensen, Charles managed to get the car up to the speed of twenty miles per hour. Emma became quite alarmed and was sure he was driving ‘too fast’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma cooked for many hired hands over the years, due to the customs of the day and the various periods of harvesting of the crops, threshing, etc. Some of this help even came from foreign countries and the isles of the sea. Each of these workers became somewhat attached to the family and enjoyed the friendly hospitality of the Peterson home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma’s home was truly a gathering place for relatives and friends also. Whenever company came there was feasting, music and singing, games of all sorts and lots of good old fashioned fun. One night Emma bedded down thirty-eight relatives in her home. There is no guarantee just how many slept but each had a place to lay his or her head. Byron says, ‘I can remember five cousins sleeping in one bed, three along the top and two across the bottom. It is just such times as these that are the most pleasant of all to remember and keep in our chest of precious memories. I recall Mother insisting on the cousins performing when they came to the home. We would always have a program when our talented cousins came. Aunt Millie’s twins could play the piano and sing; Uncle Andrew’s Edythe, Aunt Elsie’s Edith and Ellamae, Uncle Albert’s Virginia and Elaine, and Uncle Lou’s LaFaun, Rose, Alice and Marjorie could all make<span id="page-597"></span> the air ring with sweet music. Mother loved music and could play and sing a bit herself.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma was born with that rare gift of being a peacemaker. There wasn’t much room for family squabbles and misunderstandings as far as she was concerned. Also, she had a very affectionate and emotional nature. Her eyes would often overflow with tears of pure joy and appreciation and yet she would react the same way in her moments of sadness. She and Charles were true examples of pure love and devotion to each other and to their children. These same choice virtues she displayed equally with regard to her beloved father and mother, as well as to her brothers and sisters and all others who availed themselves of her generosity. She was so charitable and sensitive to the needs of others. And she had a way with people - truly she was an influence for good among her fellowmen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Once Uncle Ben Peterson, Charles’ brother, came to live in their home for a few months. He had acquired the cigarette habit, which of course was very distasteful to Emma and Charles and their family. With tact and being able to say just the right things at the right time, however, Emma was influential in giving him the courage and determination to ‘shake’ the dirty habit. He was most grateful and many were the times in the years which followed that he sincerely thanked her for this kindness to him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Uncle Joseph liked to drop by often on his way to and from his farm and partake of the proffered refreshments. And mischievous Uncle Lou, who delighted in teasing, would come in and help himself to any sweetmeats or delicacies that were available, whether Emma was at home or not. At her return from the garden or field he would pretend to be extra hungry and when she would go to serve him a piece of pie or what-not, she would find to her amazement that her ‘cupboard was bare’, so to speak, since Lou had already devoured the ‘treat’ ahead of time. Her brother Louis would have his little joke!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Passers-by and even hoboes dropped in many times at her gate requesting ‘hand outs’.<span id="page-598"></span> Some said hers was a ‘marked place’. She asked a hobo who called one day if this was so and how her place was ‘marked’. ‘This’, he said, ‘I cannot reveal - but it is true’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma was not only kind to people and even strangers but she was kind to animals. She became very attached to the cows, pigs and horses on their ranch. At one time her brother Albert was in need of a good milch cow for the foreman of his Gunnison ranch and asked Charles to sell him one. Charles consented. When the foreman came to take ‘old Bossy’ away, Emma was in tears. And she wept for quite a while afterwards, as if she really loved that old cow. She was very tender hearted when it came to their animals. The animals on the farm seemed to reciprocate.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma was active in all of the auxiliaries of the church at one time or another, being most prominent in the MIA. In the YLMIA organization she served as a counselor in the Ward and later as president. She was a Relief Society teacher and then served as first counselor to the ward Relief Society president, Mrs. Hyrum Fredrickson, and later as second counselor to President Lena Madsen in the same organization. Before such occasions as Thanksgivings, Christmases, after bazaars, etc., it became her duty and privilege to take her horse and buggy and help deliver the gifts of food and kind remembrances to the worthy families of her particular ward. Many have testified that she was indeed a virtuous and noble woman. This was indeed a great heritage to leave to her children and grandchildren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mainly she lived a life of joy and happiness and her labors were labors of love. She made it a point to go with her family for at least two visits to Wyoming while Aunt Elsie, Uncle Lou, Aunt Vena and families and some of Uncle Chris’ family lived on the ranch at ‘The Oasis’. Later, when Elsie and Vena and families moved to Goshen, Emma made numerous visits to them there. She spoke in most endearing terms of her brothers and sisters and loved ones - it was always ‘dear sister Elsie or Vena; dear brother Chris, Andrew, Joseph, Albert, Louis or Arthur; dear father, dear mother,<span id="page-599"></span> or dear cousin this or that. One had only to know her to love her.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron says, “One of mother’s happiest Christmases was when she awoke on Christmas morning to find nothing in her stocking except a can each of corn, peas and beans. Her disappointment was more than she could bear and she burst into tears. Dad quietly slipped out of the room and up the stairs and with some assistance carried down and presented to her Santa’s real gifts - the most beautiful carpet and set of dishes she had ever owned. Tears mingled with cries of joy and laughter brought a very dramatic climax to her Christmas that year.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Emma was normally slender but she developed a diabetic condition and became rather heavy in middle age. She was a striking woman, however, with her dark heavy hair, rosy cheeks and high coloring. She had a rather low-pitched speaking voice which seemed to caress as it spoke. She had a gentle, humble, sweet way about her and was very tolerant and patient, and in this she was much like her father, but she was much like her mother in her love for humanity and the living things of the earth. She was most devoted to family, friends, the less fortunate and the church - and to her Heavenly Father.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1926 she took into her home the two motherless children of Lindon H. Johnson, Dale and Ramona. She promised to care for them for a period of two weeks, but became so attached to them she asked to be allowed to keep them a whole year. At a later date these two children became her grandchildren by adoption when her oldest daughter Ada became the second wife of Mr. Johnson. But Emma did not live to see or know this - nor did she live to see any of her very own grandchildren.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Imelda, Emma’s youngest child, writes of her: “Mother must have been a wonderful teacher. I remember so many of her early students, when they were older, telling of what an outstanding teacher she had been to them. She was also a great Relief Society worker. After the horse-and-<span id="page-600"></span>  buggy days, when we children were older, we often took her to her meetings in the car and waited to drive her home. She never did learn to drive the car. I can also remember how often we had Sunday guests and Conference visitors. My, the crowds were always with us. Wish I knew how to handle guests with the grace and efficiency mother did. Those were great years! Now we seem to have so many more conveniences but our lives aren’t as abundant. Mother had few of the things we think of as necessities and take for granted now, but her life was rich and abundant in the joy of service, love and friendship - in the real values of life.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Byron and Mildred continue: “On her fiftieth birthday, 8 July 1927, electricity was turned on in Emma’s home for the first time. Before that they had used candles, kerosene or oil lamps for lighting. Emma was only privileged to enjoy this luxury for the short period of about two months. During her later years the city water was piped to her kitchen from town, a mile away, and she had running water in the house for the first time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In August of 1927 their daughter Ada and Mr. Lindon Johnson, who were then keeping company, suggested that Emma and Charles share a ten-day vacation trip with them to the colorful canyons of southern Utah. They had a wonderful trip together. But on their return, Emma didn’t feel so well and she grew rapidly worse. In spite of all the special nursing and loving care that was showered upon her, it became evident that she could not survive this last diabetic illness. She passed away at her home on the ranch east of Gunnison, 4 Sept, 1927.” It was autumn, her favorite season of the year. She was buried 7 Sept. 1927 in the Gunnison cemetery following a well attended, beautiful funeral service worthy of such a lovely lady.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ada, gentle and sympathetic in nature like Emma, was at her mother’s bedside almost constantly during this serious and final illness. She pled with her not to leave them. Ada has operated rest homes for elderly ladies for many years now, and in speaking of this she says she never helps an old lady to her rest at nights without thinking of her<span id="page-601"></span> own darling mother, during her last days; then her heart swells with love for all the “mothers of others” in her care and makes her work a labor of joy and dedication to the memory of her own precious mother whom she loved so dearly.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles Peter Peterson, husband of Emma Eliza Christensen, was born in Brunflo, Sweden, 10 June 1878, a son of Marten Gronvell Peterson and Barbru (Barbara) Pahlson Peterson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles left Sweden for the United States 2 Aug. 1879, when he was about fourteen months old, in company with his parents, Marten and Barbara Peterson, two half brothers, John and Peter (sons of his father by a former marriage), a sister Marta and a brother Paules; Charles of course being the youngest. They settled in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah among other Scandinavians, some of whom they may have known. They were not members ofthe L.D.S, Church but came to Zion to better their living conditions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles’ father was a shoemaker by trade and the 1880 census taken in Gunnison the summer of that year bears this out. It lists the family as follows: “Marten Peterson, age 45, male, married, occupation shoemaker, born in Sweden; Barbara Peterson, age 33, female, married, keeping house, born in Sweden; Peter, age 18, male, single, son of Marten, works on farm, born in Sweden; John, age 16, male, single, son of Marten, apprentice (likely to his father) born in Sweden; Marta age 6, female, single, daughter of Marten, born in Sweden; Paulus age 4, male, single, son of Marten, born in Sweden; Charies Peter age 2, male, single, son of Marten, born in Sweden.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Five other sons were born to this Peterson family after they moved to Gunnison. They were a thrifty, energetic group. The oldest son, Peter, became a shoemaker, like his father; two of the other boys became farmers, and the rest were businessmen of some sort. John at one time was Mayor of Gunnison.<span id="page-602"></span> Charles attended the public schools of Gunnison and graduated from the eighth grade, He had decided te attend B. Y. A. in Provo, when he was offered a job he felt he could not afford to turn down. Imelda writes of this: “A Mr. Bown offered Daddy a high salary if he would take over some of his herds of sheep; in fact, the price was above average and too attractive for those days and he went on the job. We often felt like scolding Mr. Bown when we were older, for our Daddy would have been a real mathematics major - or so we thought. He was always measuring hay and could tell measurements of size, weight and acreage, etc., so easily, although his book learning was so little.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles must have done all right with Mr. Bown’s sheep, for before he was twenty-five years old he had a large farm with a nice two-story house on it, some stock and equipment and a fine driving horse and rig of his own, all paid for. He was prepared to take a wife and ready and able to support a family. But he was having a little difficulty in this respect, for the girl he had chosen had made some rather stringent demands of him, before she would become his bride.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems that none of Charles’ people were members of the L.D.S, Church - nor was he. The girl he had his eyes on, Emma Christensen, refused to marry him unless he could take her to the L.D.S. Temple for the ceremony. This must have seemed difficult for a young man of his age, but he set about to try to qualify himself to become a member of the church in which she was affiliated. He succeeded, however, and was baptized into the L.D.S, Church 30 May 1903, just eleven days prior to his twenty-fifth birthday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles courted Emma in his one seated rig drawn by his fine horse, and it was in this outfit that he took her to the beautiful Manti Temple, 30 Sept. 1903, to be married, thus fulfilling their dream of several years. He took her home to live on his ranch about one mile east of Gunnison and it was here she lived the remainder of her days, and here that each of their three children, one son and two daughters, were born. It was here also that two little stillborn daughters came to them and<span id="page-603"></span> Charles made little box coffins for each and buried each in turn himself across the wash from the house on their own place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ranch itself supported the family very nicely with the cows, chickens, ducks and other barnyard animals they raised there. Charles fed lots of stock, including as many as fifty pigs at a time. Byron tells that when he used to get angry at his father he would go down to the pigpen and threw rocks at the pigs to make them squeal. Nevertheless, the son Byron learned to be a big help to Charles on the ranch, and as he grew to manhood worked side by side with his father.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles was very good to Emma’s parents - he couldn’t do too much for them. He often gave Laurs employment on his ranch and paid him well. Else liked to help thin beets and harvest potatoes for him, and when she did he paid her too. Often he gave them a “runty pig”, a lamb, a cow or a few laying hens. They were always more than welcome at his home and he at theirs, for he was more like a son to them than a son-in-law.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the death of his beloved wife Emma, 4 Sept. 1927, Charles and his three children got along by themselves until Ada was married and moved away. Then on 31 Dec. 1929 Charles married a Danish widow, Minda Peterson of Redmond, who had several children of her own. She stayed on in Redmond and Charles lived there with her but continued to help Byron operate the ranch and spent lots of time with him and Imelda.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The middle of March 1930 Charles sent Byron on a mission to South Africa and had Emma’s niece, Vera Clark, come to be company for Imelda. Vera writes;— “I had been staying at Uncle Charles’ with Imelda that summer of 1930, so I stayed right on that winter and took my 7th grade work in Gunnison. I have fond memories of that year. Byron was on his mission and Ada lived in Delta. We visited Ada and family several times during the year. Uncle Charles was so good to me!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After several years Charles’ wife, Minda, was stricken with brain cancer and rushed to a Salt Lake hospital for treatment. Charles took<span id="page-604"></span> his turn with her children watching by her bed of suffering but she soon died and he returned to live at his ranch home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was a fine gentleman and very good to everyone, especially Emma’s sister Vena and her large family. How often I remember Charles and Byron driving up in his large truck to a Christensen family reunion, with a number of George’s and Vena’s children aboard. They would come from Gunnison around by way of Goshen or Santaquin to bring them. Charles was so pleasant and jovial and always took part in the games and other activities at these reunions with seeming relish. He was usually among the first to arrive and the last to leave, bringing a spirit of good will and brotherhood along with him. I remember him as slender, tall, dark, good looking and oh so friendly. He did not push himself forward but was always there to do his part and more. He had excellent health, was a hard worker, honest and clean living, and had a ruddy glow about him that one could not help but admire.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From the time of his baptism Charles was consistant and faithful in his efforts in behalf of the church, in spite of the fact that some of his own people were downright bitter towards that organization and made things uncomfortable, if not difficult for him. Among other responsibilities, he served as Counselor in the M.I.A., an officer in the Seventies Quorum, and a member of the Hamilton Ward bishopric in Gunnison for many years. Soon after Byron returned from his mission, having no more sons to send, he sent his daughter Imelda on a Canadian mission, June 1934. He held the office of High Priest in his later years. No one could question his love for the gospel and the church. Cousin Florence C. Hougaard remembers speaking to him in the Manti Temple on one occasion, at which time Charles remarked to her that his life since he had become active in the church was like “Heaven on earth.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Byron married in 1936 and brought his wife Mildred home to the ranch house to live, Charles stayed on as a most welcome part of the family. Though he had his own room upstairs and</p>

    <p>Twenty-five years in a wheelchair yet Byron can still smile and tell a good family joke.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-605"></span> could come and go at will, he chose to enter into the family’s activities. As the grandchildren came along they learned to adore him. Byron’s oldest, Barta, tells of how thrilled she was to dance with her grandfather at a Relief Society bazaar one time when she was about seven. Charles loved to dance and was conisidered to be an excellent dancer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On 14 May 1945 Charles married Mrs. Lydia Adair and moved out of the ranch house for the first time since he had brought his bride Emma there to live some forty-one and a half years before. He and Byron continued to operate the ranch together and have most of their other activities together as well. About four months later, however, Byron was stricken with polio and rushed to the General Hospital in Salt Lake City for treatment. He would never walk again!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles looked after Mildred and her five little ones, including a two months old baby, and kept in close touch with Byron in the hospital as well. On 8 Oct. 1945, three weeks after Byron was stricken, Mildred had invited Charles and Lydia to come to the ranch for supper. But Charles never got there. Right after a good lunch that noon, one of his calves got loose and he took off after it. Without warning he was stricken with a heart attack. He died with his boots on enroute to the hospital.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of all the times when it seemed that Charles was needed most on earth, this was the time. But he was called to serve elsewhere and others were left to solve the earthly problems. His two daughters, Ada and Imelda, came to help with burial arrangements. It was six days after his death before this took place, 14 Oct. 1945. He was laid away beside his beloved wife Emma in the Gunnison Cemetery. A copy of the remarks given at his funeral service was made and sent to Byron in the Salt Lake hospital.</p>
