  <h2 id="wyoming-interlude" class="calibre9">WYOMING INTERLUDE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The part of Western Wyoming in which some of the Christensens were now living was in the general area known as Bridger Basin, through which what was left of a once mighty river wound its way. Long ago Fort Bridger, from which the region got its name, was a precious shelter from Indian’s tomahawks - the same Indians who finally whooped themselves into tame and stupid retreats on the reservations. Pioneering in this unmade country was first begun a hundred years ago by railroad workers who came to build the Union Pacific Railroad which now bisects the territory.<span id="page-425"></span> The flapping tent villages of these railroaders were soon replaced by homesteaders cabins. Then Wyoming’s vast sagebrush and grass covered prairies caught the eyes of stock raisers, and “cattle barons” with their immense herds moved in. Thousands of cattle grazed and roamed at will over the range and cattle raising became the territory’s first major industry. At first most of the range cattle there were owned by non-residents who came but once a year from the east to look after their interests in Wyoming - thus the name “Cattle Barons” was given them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Resenting the ever increasing power of the non-resident stockraisers in the business and politics of Wyoming, homesteaders began fencing in their land along the streams in order to protect themselves from ranging cattle and to break up the range. Cattlemen retaliated by having their employees file on property and, not content to fence in homesteads alone, they often included whole sections of public domain between their own property, thus gaining control of millions of acres and preventing the free use of public lands. Angry homesteaders, who would not steal from their neighbors, began to think nothing of rounding up calves belonging to some far distant “cattle baron” and applying their own brands. “Careless application of the branding irons” brought increasing financial losses and embarrassment and threatened the paradise of the cattlemen. Cattle and horse thieves flourished and rustling became a big business on the ranges of Wyoming.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Failing to pin down these “bandits of the plains” or to secure protection from them through the courts, some cattlemen felt forced to take the law into their own hands and life on the prairies of Wyoming took on the aspects of a civil war. Lynchings, shootings from ambush and other methods of frontier justice became the style as cattlemen made a strong effort to hold the range. Some hired “regulators” to kill the rustlers and frighten homesteaders from the territory. On one occasion paid professional gunmen were secretly brought into Cheyenne, Wyoming in a sealed railroad car to join in the fray; and though the<span id="page-426"></span>  importation of hired gunmen from other States was against the constitution, yet it continued. Homesteaders were killed and their property burned. It was a bigger, bloodier war than the outside world suspected. It reached its peak in 1901. Bitterness and prejudice prevailed and popular sympathy was divided between cattlemen and homesteaders. Accounts of trouble were usually contradictory and garbled and the local authorities threw up their hands in dismay. But law abiding citizens were indignant at the flagrant disregard for law which allowed wholesale murder of guilty and innocent alike. Federal authorities were finally called in to intervene in this inter-sectional warfare between rustlers, homesteaders and cattlemen. Conviction and execution of a “regulator” in 1903 ended it to all purposes, but the rustling went on about the same.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Meantime, it had been discovered that Wyoming ranges were ideal for sheep raising. Sheep could graze the arid and semi-arid regions there and the dry, cold climate helped to produce a heavy growth of long, fine wool. So trailing sheep through Wyoming became another profitable industry. This began to annoy the cattlemen and, having failed to remove the rustlers entirely from the range, they began to concentrate on getting rid of the ever increasing herds of sheep which trailed through the country and fed on the public domain. They argued that the ranges were becoming over-stocked, but especially that cattle would not graze where sheep had been - that sheep had an offensive odor and that they ruined the range. Frank Benton stated the situation in this rhyme:—</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sheep range - cattle sure won’t graze<br class="calibre4"/> But cowboys hate sheep anyways!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Various practices were adopted by the cattlemen in different parts of the State to drive out the sheep owners. Cowboys stampeded whole herds of steers through flocks. Some bands were driven over cliffs. Poison was scattered on the salt-sage to kill the sheep. When attacks on the sheep failed more drastic measures were taken - herders were killed, wagons were burned and herds were scattered. For example, in 1905 Louis A.<span id="page-427"></span>  Gantz was trailing 7,000 sheep to the Big Horn Forest Reserve for grazing. Ten masked men visited his camp, which was about 40 miles from the town of Basin. They clubbed and shot 4, 000 of his sheep, burned his wagons, killed a team of horses, destroyed $700 worth of grain, and warned his herders to leave the country and never return. This “Cattlemen’s and Sheepmen’s War” finally ended in 1909 and forced the recognition of the sheepmen’s rights to a share of the range.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These great borderland dramas were almost at an end when Chris took over the management of the Bennion Livestock Company (1908). This was an organization owned in the main by Chris himself and John M. Cannon, also of Salt Lake City; but there were other stockholders. According to Chris’ daughter Pearl, the company controlled or owned about 50,000 acres of range land and summer lambing ground on which they cared for their thousands of head of sheep, plus a few cattle and horses. An extensive ranch and summer range land in the Weber River Valley in northeastern Utah served as the company’s main base of operation. The ranch itself they called “The Weber”, and here they had a large two-story ranch house. Through successful irrigation methods which Chris first introduced there, he and his hired help were able to raise thousands of tons of wild or “white” hay. The Company also had rangeland in Chalk Creek Basin near the head of the Weber River and also owned property at Trout Creek and Manila and on the West Desert, where they owned two ranches and leased the school sections. They also owned a small ranch at Upton, Utah, about twenty miles over the mountain from The Weber, where many of the company’s cattle and horses were cared for and hay and grain raised. Chris’ brother Arthur managed and farmed this ranch for the Bennion Livestock Company for four or five years (1911-1915). He was a stockholder for a time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Company wintered four herds of sheep of about 2,500 each, near a place in western Wyoming called Carter, which being on the railroad was an outfitting place for sheepmen who<span id="page-428"></span>  came there for supplies. They wintered two similar herds down at Manila where it was a little warmer and they could feed some hay. They also sent one large dry herd onto the West Desert in Skull Valley. In the spring the herds from Carter and Manila trailed to the lambing grounds at places about thirty miles southwest of Carter, called Spring Valley and at Piedmont, Wyoming. From the lambing grounds the sheep trailed on to the large shearing corral which Chris and John Cannon had built at Altmont, Wyoming. Here thousands of sheep were sheared each spring for several years. At Piedmont they also had a large dipping vat where they dipped the sheep to kill the ticks the years the sheep ticks were so bad (1915-16 and 1917-18). From the shearing corrals the sheep trailed on to their summer range on The Weber. This trailing was hard on sheep and men, sheep dogs and horses too. Chris was always on the job at those times with the buckboard and “Fannie” the mule, and “Old Bay” his faithful horse. Later he got a Ford pickup truck which made things easier for him and traveling much faster.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Bennion Livestock Company employed quite a number of men each year, including a manager and workers on each ranch, as well as two herders with each of its many herds, plus “Camp Jacks” who were the men engaged to cook and care for the camps and horses. As mentioned, Chris’ brother Arthur managed the Upton ranch for the company and his brother Louis helped with the herds. George Clark, mentioned as having married Chris’s sister Elvena, was one of the dependable herders and Peter A. Jensen, who later married Chris’ daughter Pearl, was assistant manager of the company as well as one of the herders. Chris’ two older sons, Elmer and LeRoy, helped with the sheep or on the ranches as soon as they were old enough.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chris often bought hay for his company in and near Lyman, Wyoming, which was a number of miles east of Carter, and he became well acquainted in the area and bought some property for the company from a Mr. C. N. Larsen about 12 miles east of Lyman, 160 acres together with</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-429"></span>  water rights for part of it, part being in alfalfa and part dry farm. About 1913 Chris, as before mentioned, had bought this 160 acres from the company as an investment. Later, with his encouragement, some of his brothers and sisters had taken up the adjoining homestead land together with a certain amount of range land that went with these homesteads, until by the middle of 1917 most of the ground still available in this area had been taken up by members of the Christensen family. On this jointly owned land, The Oasis, Chris, his daughter and his brothers and sisters envisioned a large and prosperous estate some day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the meantime, war clouds had gathered over Europe and by 1914 the major countries there were involved in a bloody struggle, It had been hoped that the United States could be kept free of this conflict but by April 1917 she had been swept into it. Soon two million American men were fighting with their allies in Europe and an equal number were training in this country preparatory to going over there. Thus with the coming of a bright new century with its new inventions, enterprises, and miracles, came the shadow of this new century war - “a war to end all wars” it was said. Would people never learn then?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Back in western Wyoming on The Oasis, that middle of September 1917, this war must have seemed far away. Louis, Florence and their six children were living in their three-room house there, improving their property and harvesting their crops. Elsie and her five children were living in their two-room house not far away, cleaning up their land and getting ready to harvest their potatoes. Elmer and LeRoy, or “Roy” as we shall henceforth call him, usually took turns with the herds or farming on their father’s and sister Pearl’s places each summer. This summer Roy was on The Oasis with Pearl, helping to harvest the hay and grain they had raised. Elvena (now Mrs, George T. Clark) was living alone in her two-room log cabin, her husband being away with the sheep most of the time. All seemed peaceful and serene there that lovely autumn, but clouds of trouble were gathering on the horizon for them<span id="page-430"></span>  also. Following are extracts from a testimony later given by Louis:— “I reached Lyman, Wyoming in December 1913. I remained here in the country until the spring of 1914. I was with the Bennion Livestock Company, an assistant to my brother Chris “I” Christensen. He was then the general manager of this company. I never was a stockholder but I worked for the company every winter after I came here. I took up my land in January 1915. I moved my family here in March 1916 and moved them directly to the ranch … I built my first house in the spring of 1916. It was a log and frame house and it was burned down in October 1916. At that time I attached no importance to this and did not think it was a criminal act. I rebuilt the house in the spring of 1917… The only trouble I had had in the county up to this point was with a Mr. _______ at the oil well about 25 miles west of Carter, who shot at a herder of C. I. Christensen’s and C. I. saw him about the matter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On September 14, 1917 I was at my ranch and my wife and children were there. On this day I was ploughing during part of the day and in the afternoon I went and hauled water from the spring and then fixed up my wagon to haul wood. I retired between nine and ten o’clock. During the night our dog barked and attracted my attention. This was between about two and three o’clock A.M. About three o’clock I heard a horse come in and up to the east side of the house and then a little later take off on the run, I remarked to my wife, “I guess Mike (our dog) is running ‘Old Cap’ off. (Old Cap is one of my horses.) I laid there for a few moments. I had my clock set for four o’clock and got up to see what time it was. When I went to the south room (kitchen) I saw the reflection of a light through the window and I went to the door and opened it and got the smell of fumes. I stepped out and saw a blue flame about six inches high at the edge of the roof and at the same time detected an odor that smelled like wood alcohol. I put out the fire with the water I had hauled. I found part of a torch, a piece about two inches long and an inch wide. It looked like canvas or piece of water bag<span id="page-431"></span>  and there was charcoal there as if it had been attached to a stick and it seemed as though there was a little piece of cotton or wool about the size of my fingernail and then ashes of old rags. It had burned through the shingles and into the sheeting under the shingles for about 2½ ft. wide and 3 or 4 ft. long. After daylight I discovered the horses tracks and followed them from the house and along the road clear up to Mr. White’s on the way to Lyman. There sheep had come into the road and obliterated the tracks. I went at once to Bishop Rawlins and reported this attempted burning to him, and the following day I went to Evanston and talked to County Attorney Mathews. I had received a threatening letter in July but had told no one of it up to this time, I then told Bishop Rawlins about it. I returned home after my trip to Evanston and watched every night from then on but saw nothing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“But on the night of Sept. 20th someone came again but I did not hear them, though I was up until about midnight watching. The next morning my oldest boy went out and there found, on the south side and about six feet from where the other fire had been, someone had attempted to again light a fire. I found tracks of a horse that had been standing outside. This was the same track as the first one. I followed this track up on the bench two hundred yards to where I found another track as though a horse had been standing. There was evidence of this and where it had turned around there. One horse was sharp-shod, the same as the first track, the other was shod on the front feet with old shoes. I followed the tracks up to Jenson’s and then a lot of horses had come in and so obliterated the tracks that I lost them. I reported this to the sheriff by phone and also to Bishop Rawlins. The sheriff said, ‘We will have to do something about this’, but he did not come. Dewey Rawlins came out to watch with me and we watched all the night of the 2lst, but nothing happened.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On the night of the 22nd Dewey and I came out of the house and we heard a signal - it was a whistle. We went out by the barn and out on the canal bank and while there we heard someone in<span id="page-432"></span>  the potato patch between us and the house. I sent Dewey down along the south side of the potato patch and I went north along the canal. A man ran out of the northwest corner of the potato patch and I shot at him in the dark as he was running. I shot at him a second time as he was near the bank of the canal and I think I hit him, because I heard the bullet strike something. We searched along the canal that night but found no one and it began to rain very hard and was very dark. The next morning we went out and found where someone had fallen on some sagebrush. There were imprints in the mud of clothing, as though it was corduroy, and there were footprints; but on account of the rain they were so that we could not properly measure them. Tracks of two horses had come together at this point and it looked as though someone had gotten on one of the horses and ridden off. Dewey and I followed the tracks across the bench and from the creek towards Mr. White’s house. We believed they were the same tracks that we had seen before. I reported this to the county sheriff’s office but no one came out. But on Monday night Attorney Mathews was advised by Bishop Rawlins of the matter and he came to the ranch on Tuesday.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was quite apparent that someone wished to make trouble for the Christensens by trying to burn them out, or at least frighten them into leaving the place. The anonymous letter received by Louis on July 14, 1917, though he had paid no attention to it at the time and destroyed it, not wanting to frighten his family, had given him three months to move out or he would be burned down. But the threatener had waited only two months to make the attempted burning. In the newspaper published at Lyman, the first article in relation to the burning was under the date of Sept. 25th, mentioning the attempted fires on the nights of 14th, 20th and 22nd of September and stating that the County Attorney and the sheriff were in Lyman on the case by the 25th. The Bridger Valley Enterprise also printed an account of the threatened burnings. But everyone in the region was talking about it and rumors flew thick and fast. Suspects were found on every hand, centering mostly on one particular crowd. A certain Mr. So-and-so was said to have made the<span id="page-433"></span>  statement that it was “no worse for a man to be burned out than to be eaten out and by reason of Christensen eating him out he had lost about twelve hundred head of sheep”. Other suspicious statements were reported, but no one could really find out the motive and as the truth was hidden and thus unknown, rumors flew to take its place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The testimony of Uinta County Sheriff Lowhan backs up the statements Louis had made:— “I heard of the trouble the day I was called there the first time. It was about the 25th. Christensen came in and told me about it and said someone had attempted to burn him out by throwing a wick or rags on the roof. He told me about a letter but that it had been destroyed. I did not go up until the time he was supposed to have shot someone. I met County Attorney Mathews at Lyman and went to investigate the attempted burnings. When I got west of the place the shooting was alleged to have taken place, Mathews and Christensen joined me and Christensen showed me the east and the south side of his house where burning attempts had been made. It was burned in both places and through the shingles in one. He showed me the remnants of the torch; it looked like pieces of old drawers, charred and nearly all ashes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The house is a three-room frame house about twenty by sixteen feet. It faces east. There is a hill behind it to the west. He showed me where he stood when he shot. He was up on the ditch bank to the west. I saw where a man had fallen on the brush and left imprints of corduroy in the mud, but the brush was broken down and I could not measure his tracks on account of the rain. It had rained all night but the tracks did show that horses had come to where the man was lying. There were two tracks came up to him and I could measure those tracks. We followed them to the road and then they went towards Lyman. They came off from the hill towards Lyman. There was no blood to be found anywhere along there to indicate that the man might have been wounded. On this trip I deputized L. D. Christensen and left him there.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is easy to see how these threats aroused<span id="page-434"></span>  the fear of the families living on the Oasis. If one was in danger they all were. LaFaun, then nearly sixteen, remembers taking her turn standing guard with a gun at nights. Edith, Elsie’s oldest daughter, recalls how her two older brothers, A. Owen and Edgar, used to stand guard at their place at nights and how even her dear mother stood outside with a gun, taking her turn at guarding, night after night. She remembers, during those frightening times, that as soon as it was dark all the lamps would be put out and she and her younger sister Ellamae would be put to bed and told to stay there and not get up and run around under any conditions, or “the mean men would come and burn the house down” - “Firebugs” was what they called them. On the other hand, A. Owen, then a brave lad of fifteen and man of the house, now remembers that he thought the whole thing was more or less “much ado about nothing” at the time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus a week went by on The Oasis and Sunday, September 30, 1917 came around. Chris, who went back and forth between the herds, the ranches and his home in Salt Lake City, was not there but Pearl and Roy were there living in Pearl’s house and had been helping with the harvest. But let Pearl tell of it:— “The harvest was over, the land cleared of alfalfa, grain, oats, wheat and lucerne seed; the potatoes had been harvested - we raised lots of potatoes for the company. Five huge stacks of hay were piled in our yard, as well as large stacks of oats, wheat and alfalfa seed waiting for the threshers. It was a quiet Sunday evening the last of September, about 8 o’clock.  Supper was over, the dishes done, and Roy and I were sitting reading. All at once I looked up to see everything so bright and said, ‘Oh, what’s that bright light - it looks like the sun coming up!’ We rushed to the door and opened it and looking out saw everything in the yard ablaze! The stacks were on fire about 50 ft. from the house. Horses were screaming, pigs squealing and chickens clacking. We ran out and started fighting fire. I drew water from the well and Roy threw it on the barn. It seemed only minutes until Aunt Elsie’s boys and Uncle Lou were there and with their help we got the four<span id="page-435"></span>  horses out and saved the pigs and the barn, but all the crops - a whole years work - were burned to the ground. Soon some people came from Lyman; they had seen the flames from that distance. Someone went for father and he came the following night.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We now go on with Uncle Lou’s story:— “On the 30th of September 1917 I was home with my family and Dewey Rawlins was there with me. This night we went up west of our place and then Dewey went south to circle around the south and east side of the place while I was going to the west. When I got up on the hill I saw my brother’s place burning and I ran over there. Later Dewey came over and I asked him, ‘What about my place?’ He ran back towards my place. A little later I started back towards my house and then I heard some shots in that direction and started to run. As I was running along towards my home I came near what is called ‘the Old Bedstead’, on the bench, and here someone shot at me and struck me through the coat, though the bullet only grazed my skin. When I reached the house, Dewey reported to me that he had seen a man west of the house and had shot at him several times. It was now about 11 P.M. Later we  tracked two horses from my brother, C. I. Christensen’s place to my place, where they separated upon the hill west of my house. Later they had joined again and we tracked them towards Lyman.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here is the statement of Deputy Sheriff Twombly of Uinta County about his activities the same night:— “On Sunday, 30th Sept., I went to Lyman and on out to C. I. Christensen’s, while the stacks were still burning. I found tracks close to the stacks. There was one horse track that I tracked from the hill to L. D. Christensen’s house and to within 40 yards of the house. It looked as though the horse was there tied and that a man got off and went down from the hill, from which, near to the Christensen house, I followed his tracks to within 50 yards of it and into the potato patch southwest of the house. It appeared as though he stopped here and then left running. He ran out of the potato patch and up towards the old bedstead that is<span id="page-436"></span>  standing upon the hill and there he kneeled down and I could see the corduroy imprints in the place. This was where L. D. Christensen claims to have been shot at by a man who was kneeling near this bedstead. I found no shells at this point but measured the horse tracks. They came from the south side of the burned stacks, up past the west end and around the east side. There seemed to be but one track but there could also have been a horseman on the opposite side. A lane runs east and west. I followed the track from C. I.‘s place in a southerly direction towards L. D.‘s and then west. L. D. Christensen and Dewey Rawlins helped me and we measured the man’s tracks thirty or forty times - they were the same, a cowboy boot. We watched Christensen measure the tracks of both horses. First he measured the tracks near his home and he and Rawlins both claimed that they were the same that they had seen there before. Charley White, who lives west of Christensen’s, claims that he heard his dogs bark early in the evening but did not go out to see whether anybody was passing or not.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Impressions of then five year old Ellamae are included in her present history thus:— “… About this time we moved with mother to a homestead near Lyman, Wyoming, where Uncle Chris, Pearl, Uncle Lou, Uncle Andrew, and later Aunt Vena also had homesteads. To me this was quite an adventure. I was oblivious to the problems of clearing the land and making a home of stretches of sagebrush, but remember the huge bonfires of sagebrush when the land was cleared. We explored the hills during the days, free as the wind, but after dark we were afraid to venture out. I remember my brothers sitting watch with a gun, and of returning home to find rocks thrown through the window. I remember waking one night to see Uncle Chris’ haystacks on fire… At the time I didn’t know anything about range wars between the cattlemen, sheepmen and homesteaders - it was only something frightening.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chris came the night after his crops were fired and a few others came to help guard the homes of the Christensens on The Oasis. Someone<span id="page-437"></span>  with a gun was at each dwelling and others had set places to keep an eye out for. Each was cautioned to shoot into the air as a warning for help if anything unusual took place or anyone strange was seen in their area. There was a tenseness of foreboding in the air. Twenty-three year old Pearl and her brother Roy, nearing seventeen, were on guard at her’s and their father’s place on the night of Tuesday, Oct. 2nd, 1917. Chris himself, saying he was going down to one of his sister’s places to see how things were there, had left going in that direction. The lights were out in the house but the door was open in order that the two inside could have a better view of the yard, though the opening was protected by a screen door. Suddenly each saw, almost simultaneously, something moving outside in the brush nearby - it looked like a man crouched down. They both sprang to the door to give a warning shot. One held the screen door open while the other prepared to shoot into the air. The action was almost automatic as they had been so carefully instructed by their father in what to do in such a case.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But then something went wrong. The motion that triggered the gun also jarred loose the screen door and it swung into the path of the bullet and banged shut, deflecting the shot to where it never had been aimed or intended, worlds without end. It all happened so rapidly and then came the startling and heart-rending cry into the night - “Oh… You’ve got me!” It was their father’s voice. No one on earth had known that the time of Christian I. Christensen’s probation was to be over then or that so successful a career would come to so sad an end. But though mortally wounded and in intense pain, heaven granted this exceptional man a few more days of life that he might comfort his grief-stricken children and try to make them understand that they were no more to blame than he, for he had thought they were asleep when he had returned unexpectedly and thus failed to tell them. Reason tells us that no one was to blame, except perhaps the person or persons who had perpetrated the whole thing in the first place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His wife and family were quickly notified and<span id="page-438"></span>  Caroline came before he passed away, 5 Oct. 1917, the day after his fiftieth birthday. His oldest son, eighteen year old Elmer, then farming on the ranch in Cedar Valley, had had a premonition that something was wrong before he got the upsetting word; for he had dreamed, or imagined, that his father came and stood in the door of his tent the night before.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They took the body to Gunnison, Utah, for burial beside his daughters, Elora and Orilla, in the family plot there. Then the bereaved Caroline and her six fatherless children, Pearl 23, Elmer 18, Roy nearing 17, Ivy near 13, Farrald 8 and Gordon 5½, went back to their home in Salt Lake City for a time. They had difficult days and decisions ahead. But always life must go on somehow for those that are left, and soon they were back again doing what they had to do, some in Wyoming and others in Salt Lake City.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elsie’s daughter, Ellamae, tells about going to Utah when her Uncle Chris died:— ‘I remember when Uncle Chris was shot; and when he died we rode with his body to Evanston, from where we went by train to Salt Lake City and on to Gunnison. In Evanston Edith and I had to go to bed in the hotel with our shoes on because we had left the button hook home.” Men were left guarding at The Oasis while the occupants were all away, for even in the face of this tragedy no safety could be felt for their homes there. Sheriff Lowhan made this statement: — “I came back to the Christensen’s ranch on Oct. 4th, “after C. I. was shot and stayed there until the 9th. On this trip I remained while L. D. took his brother’s body to Utah for burial. Dewey Rawlins and Rube Field were there one night watching and from the 9th to the 12th Deputy Sheriff Twombly was there.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louis and his family, Elsie and hers, as well as Vena, returned to the ranch in Wyoming as soon as possible, for this was their home and they had no intention of abandoning the struggle to save what they had there from the evil forces that seemed determined to drive them out. Elsie of course planned to move into Lyman for the winter to put the children in school, as she had the year before,<span id="page-439"></span>  and Florence planned to do the same. We quote again from the testimony of Louis:— ‘I moved my family away from the ranch and into Lyman on Oct. 20, 1917, but I remained there at the place and others were with me. </p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On Nov. 19th I was in Lyman and left between three and four o’clock P.M. to go over to the ranch, arriving there before dark. I put my horses in the barn and then went over to the sheep camp about a mile south and east. Elmer Christensen and Miles Critchley were at the camp. I expected to have supper there with them and then go back to the house, but they induced me to stay for the night. We went to bed but the sheep were restless and woke us up. We got up to see what was the matter and it was then that we saw that my house was on fire. This was between eleven and eleven thirty that night. We at once ran over to the place. It looked at first like only the roof on the east side was on fire, but we found that the whole house was burning and it burned to the ground. There was nothing we could do to stop it. We later found that horse tracks came in at the gate and went up to the west window. We followed this track back west again; it was what we called a ‘malable shoe’ and the first time I had seen a track of this kind.” The sheriff was notified next morning and he came out to the ranch to investigate; his statement follows:— “I went out again when L. D.‘s place was burned and I found the track came down the road and in the mud to the northeast corner of the house and passed the north end of the house and turned west and then turned in close to the house and then went back the same way, out of the gate and up the road towards Lyman. I measured the track. It was 6 inches from toe to heel and 3½ inches between heels, It was a new shoe. There was just one horse track.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Someone was responsible for these burnings at The Oasis and it was not the ghosts of past range wars. The Uinta County officials were anxious to get at the bottom of things. Judge Albert Christensen of Manti, Utah, lawyer of the family, was likewise determined to see that the<span id="page-440"></span>  guilty parties who had caused so much misery and anxiety were found and brought before the law. He was instrumental in getting the Uinta County officials to hire the help of a private investigator or detective from the Burns Detective Agency in Salt Lake City to work with them secretly, gathering evidence and tracking down the criminals. Albert himself engaged a well known criminal lawyer of Salt Lake City to work on the case, evaluating evidence, interviewing witnesses and taking testimonies, as well as to assist in the prosecution should the case come to trial.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The report of the activities of this private detective in his efforts to track down the parties guilty of trying to burn out the Christensens in what was known as “The Uinta County, Wyoming Arson Investigation”, is full of drama and intrigue, but will have to wait for a later telling. Though arrests were made, the suspects were let out on bail and the case never came before the courts, nor were there ever any convictions. While the officials tried to learn the truth, the costs mounted. Finally the investigation was completely dropped by the county officials. The general feeling among most of the area was one of anger and disgust. There was the familiar talk among them that some of the officials must have been in with the crooks; others said the reason the officials were opposed to any further investigation was that perhaps the detective got too close to some of their friends. No one really knew.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Judge A. H. Christensen hired the detective to go on with his investigation independent of the county officials. He was not anxious to have the criminals behind bars for vengeance sake but to assure that there would be no repetition of the same and that his brothers and sisters and their families could be left alone and safe to pursue their normal living at The Oasis. After several more weeks, however, reports and accounts became so contradictory and garbled and rumors so irresponsible that the detective was dismissed and the investigation closed after six months in all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We can’t help but believe that most members of the various Christensen families, if not all, were<span id="page-441"></span>  greatly relieved to have this chapter of their lives ended. The notoriety brought on by this investigation must have been extremely distasteful to these modest people who were anything but publicity seekers. But with the end of the investigation came the end of the dream for the great estate on The Oasis for the Christensen brothers and sisters. The dream must have begun to dim the day their oldest brother, Christian, died. It wasn’t long before his family sold out their interests to Louis and left the area. Elsie and her children left before long to rejoin their husband and father in making a new home. Elvena and her husband went back to Utah to live. The girls realized little if anything from their homesteads, which were eventually sold for taxes. Andrew failed to prove up on his property there so lost it in the long run. Louis and his family were the only ones who continued to live in Wyoming. But though he continued to retain a good share of The Oasis, he went into law enforcement as a profession, being elected to the office of Uinta County Sheriff for several terms and finally being appointed to the position of State Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Wyoming’s Governor, Nellie Taylor Ross, first woman governor in the United States. So The Oasis dream disappeared for the Christensens, but with the swift changing years new dreams, new hopes, new opportunities and fresh challenges took its place for all of them.</p>
