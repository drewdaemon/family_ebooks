  <p class="calibre1">(35) Gladys Christensen, twin (8) was born 17 Feb. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. She gives glimpses into various periods of her life as she writes her “Recollections”:— “Upton - age about four or five. Grace and I used to play in the storehouse which was sometimes used for the storage of dynamite. One of our favorite games was playing ‘Papa and Mama’. One day Grace was the papa, whose job was to get up in the morning to make the fire. She set fire to a rope which was hanging from the ceiling. About that time mother called and we scampered out, not realizing that in a matter of minutes the whole place would be ablaze. Our Uncle Albert Gledhill spotted the smoke and got everyone out of our adjoining house in a hurry, as they thought there was dynamite there, though it turned out there wasn’t at that time. Grace and I didn’t tell anyone till years later that we started that fire.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Uncle Bert saved me again! He was coming home from the fields and spotted a gingham dress floating in the ditch of water not far from our house. He thought that a piece of mother’s washing had blown into the ditch. He pulled it out and lo and behold it was I! Apparently I had been watching <span id="page-823"></span> the water running under the bridge and fallen in. He carried me by the heels to the house and the doctor said this probably saved my life by allowing all the water to drain out of me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Gunnison - age six. I remember how anxious I was to go to school. The day finally arrived and I was so afraid I was going to be late. In desperation Mother finally put me in a closet until it was time to go. It was fun being ‘twins’ in school. I don’t recall any others in our grade. My name was always ‘Grace and Gladys’ and Grace’s was ‘Gladys and Grace’. Soon we moved to live in a beautiful red-brick house in the east part of town. I guess we didn’t have much money because mother took in boarders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then one summer we almost cried when we found out that Dad and Mother had rented our beautiful house to some ‘foreigners’ and we were going to move to a farm northwest of Gunnison. There was a two roomed house on the farm and it was really surprising how warm and comfortable Mother made it look, although it was rather crowded for our family of seven. Mother wanted to be sure that our musical education was not neglected, so down to the farm went our piano and every week there were music lessons in town, with plenty of practicing in between. In winter we went to school by buggy and ‘Old Grady’, our dear old horse. Rain, snow or shine we went to school! Also in winter Mother insisted that Grace and I wear those awful hand knitted black stockings. We were so embarrassed with them that they came off as soon as we hit the school grounds. Then there were those ‘black sateen bloomers and the scuffers’ which never seemed to wear out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Salt Lake City - age twelve. I went to live with my Aunt Mary and Uncle Glen Dowdle in Sait Lake City. Mother thought that I should further my musical education at the McCune School of Music. I went to summer school there on Sixth South. I had a great time and loved living with Aunt Mary. I don’t know what arrangements were made for my keep, but every week here would come two lbs. of home-made butter and printed on the wrapping ‘Made by Mrs. A. M. Christensen.’ <span id="page-824"></span> Mother used to sell her home-made butter to stores in Gunnison. One morning Aunt Mary found me asleep in bed with a picture of Melrose in my arms and tear stains on my face, so that was the end of my city life for awhile.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Manti - age fifteen. In the middle of my second year in High School we moved to Manti and started a new life in the ‘Eagle House Hotel’. Dad left the hotel business to us women and went to work elsewhere. Mother too worked very hard (with our help) and it was not an easy life, but it was not without its compensations. We did meet many new friends. Doug Larsen was one of Mother’s star boarders at the hotel. He worked for the Utah State Road Commission and spent quite a lot of time in Manti. At one time there was some competition between Grace and me about who would get a date with Mr. Larsen. Grace finally won out and she and Douglas have been happily married for thirty-six years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Miss Farnsworth (later Aunt Myrtle) taught me English composition at Manti High. She was an excellent teacher. After graduation from there Grace and I attended Snow College. After a year there Mr. E. T. Reid, Superintendent of the South Sanpete School District, asked me to consider teaching group piano in the district. It was done with cardboard keyboards. I agreed and spent the summer studying in Salt Lake City, again at the McCune School of Music. I lived with Aunt Sarah Christensen and just loved her I spent many happy times that summer with cousins Margaret and Lucile.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I taught that winter and spent my time in schools of nine different towns. One of these towns was Clarion where most of my students were Japanese - but they were excellent students. I would ride with Mr. Reid when he was going my way. Other times it was agreed that I could get a car at the Gently Garage in Manti. They charged the school district eight cents per mile which included gas, oil and the works. I really had a good time on those days.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grace went on the college and started a <span id="page-825"></span> teaching career until she married at the age of twenty-three. I went on to business college - teaching was not for me! After graduation I got a job with the Fleishman Yeast Company, first in Salt Lake City and then in San Francisco, Calif. and am still with the same firm.” Gladys has never married and when I saw her last I wondered how she ever managed it. She is a charming, lovely person.</p>
