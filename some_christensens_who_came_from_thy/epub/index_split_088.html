  <p class="calibre1">(42) Henry Marvin Christensen (3) was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 1 Oct. 1911 in the family home in the southwest part of town, which house is still standing (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When he was about ten years old his family moved to a farm on the “Rocky Point” a mile or so west of town, because of financial reverses. Here his father fed livestock and Marvin was expected to help where he could. He attended public school in Gunnison, which was a good walk from the farm. When he was going on fifteen his father passed away (1926) and a little over a year later his mother, two brothers, Virgil and Don and himself moved to Fayette, Utah, about six miles north of Gunnison to live with his mother’s brother, Uncle Henry Bartholomew, who was a widower with small sons of his own. This move ended Marvin’s formal schooling.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Like his brothers, Marvin loved to hunt and fish and many trips to mountains, meadows and <span id="page-855"></span> streams were enjoyed by them for these purposes. The Christensen boys were welcomed by the young people of the small village of Fayette and they had lots of good times. Marvin began keeping company with a local girl, Elva Eliza Olsen (born 23 Oct. 1912 in Fayette to Joseph and Dora Mellor Olsen). The two were married in the Manti Temple 1 July 1931, when Elva was going on nineteen and Marvin was not yet twenty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The couple procured a farm west of Fayette where Marvin farmed but they lived in Fayette. And though Marvin was brought up as a farmer, he had a liking and talent for building also. He built the home they lived in - tore down an old rock church storehouse and used that rock for the walls. He and Elva had five children, two dying soon after their births. But shortly after fourteen years of marriage the couple were divorced, 17 Aug. 1945. The three surviving children, ages thirteen to seven, went with Elva, who stayed in the area. She also received the home and farm. Later she remarried and moved to Salina, Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marvin left Fayette and moved north to the area of Lehi, Utah, where he operated a church farm for a few years. During these past years he has had a truck service and done some building of homes, etc. It is said he built the home in Lehi where he and his second wife now live. He  remarried 26 Feb. 1946 in Elko, Nevada a young divorcee, Mrs. Lois Marie Ferguson Winterton (born 21 Apr. 1922 in Sandy, Utah to Stanley W. and Dorothy Larson Ferguson). Lois had two young sons, ages seven and almost five. Marvin raised these boys until they married and left the home, but he never adopted them. He and Lois have four children of their own, three sons and one daughter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marvin, like the other sons of Joseph and Roxie Christensen, is a big fellow. He has gone into building almost wholly now as an occupation - houses,  garages, fireplaces - and what have you. The four children are still at home and all teenagers together and all in school. Being father of nine children and stepfather of two others, has kept him busy over the years. There have been thorns and <span id="page-856"></span> thistles along the way but also plenty of sunshine and roses. And though his formal schooling stopped when he moved from Gunnison some forty-two years ago, his education in the “University of Hard Knocks” has continued and will continue to go on to the end, as it will for us all. For life itself is a schooling and we are all pupils and, whether we wish to admit it or not, we are all looking towards our own day of graduation.</p>
