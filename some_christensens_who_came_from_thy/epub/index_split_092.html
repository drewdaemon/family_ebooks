  <p class="calibre1">(46) Gorden Larsen Christensen (1) was born 4 Apr. 1912 in Sait Lake City, Utah. He was just five-and-a-half years old when his father died. His sister Ivy writes of him:- “Gorden grew to be a tall lad, six feet or more, with dark brown hair. He always seemed to me to be a little shy but was a great tease. He enjoyed sports and was very  good at basketball and football. He did a little boxing with his older brother Elmer. Everyone joked about this because mother was always afraid he would hurt Elmer, the older of the two by nearly <span id="page-874"></span> thirteen years but some smaller in stature. Gorden’s favorite pastime seemed to be reading. He would sit for hours reading book after book. He was a very clean living boy and always attended to his church duties.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His brother Farrold says of him, “Gorden had the normal love for life, people and sports. He had graduated from the LDS High School in Salt Lake City and was attending the LDS Business College when he was stricken with appendicitis and died soon after, 9 Jan. 1930, in Salt Lake of a ruptured appendix. He was buried in Salt Lake City.</p>
