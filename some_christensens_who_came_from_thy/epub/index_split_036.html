  <h2 id="christian-i-christensen" class="calibre9">CHRISTIAN “I” CHRISTENSEN</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian, first child of Laurs and Else K, Christensen, was born Friday 4 Oct, 1867 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, during the raging of the Black Hawk Indian War there, Perhaps he first. awakened to the war-whoops of savage redmen and <span id="page-468"></span> the fierce beating of warning drums, Both his father and paternal grandfather fought in that war with others of the hard-pressed occupants of the then eighteen year old settlement of his birth. He was christened just plain Christian but in early manhood he assumed the middle initial of “I”, He was often called “Chris” or “C, I.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the age of three-and-a-half, the war being over, young Christian moved with his Danish emigrant parents, a baby brother Andrew, and others of his father’s relatives, to a smaller settlement some fifteen miles southwest of Manti, called Gunnison. A short time after his seventh birthday his parents joined the “United Order” and moved five or six miles southeast of Gunnison to the very small United Order community of North Mayfield, taking Chris and his then three younger brothers with them. The account of their circumstances and experiences in the “Order” and later in South Mayfield, have been given in some detail in another chapter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in Mayfield, we remember, that Chris first attended school. His daughter Pearl tells of this:— “Christian had very little chance for an education in school but he was taught by his mother, at her knee, while she was spinning, carding or doing other household duties. She, having had a fine education, taught him so well that when he did enter school for the first time he was placed in the sixth grade. He studied very hard and had an excellent memory. It was in Mayfield also that Christian suffered the long-lasting and severe eye infection which threatened to destroy his sight and might have, had it not been for the constant efforts, faith and prayers of his loving parents, grandfather Christensen, and other concerned relatives, Instead, however, he was left with a “happy tear”! for life. Doubtless it was the persistence of this eye infection that kept the boy from entering school earlier. It was in Mayfield, too, that Christian was baptized a member of the L. D. S. Church. This took place on his tenth birthday and his mother recorded it in her journal like this:— “Christian Christensen, døbt den 4 October 1877 i May Field, døbt of Henry Jensen.” His younger <span id="page-469"></span> brother Andrew, four months past eight, was baptized the same day, and by the same Henry Jensen, Counselor to Bishop O. C. Olsen of Mayfield.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Chris was going on thirteen the family sold their home in South Mayfield and moved back to Gunnison. His father leased a farm in Christenburg, midway between Mayfield and Gunnison.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here he and his boys farmed and the family lived for a number of summers. Christian was a great help on the farm for he had started farming young. Pearl tells of this:— “When Christian was about six, he started to help his father on the farm. He also herded a few sheep and cows on the flats in Mayfield, Gunnison and later in Christenburg. Many a day he skipped off with a smile, humming the tunes he had heard his mother hum and sing to him. He would carry a lunch tied up in a knapsack on a stick over his shoulder. Most of the time this lunch consisted of a slice or two of homemade bread and a slice of bacon or salt pork; and on his way he’d go, never complaining. He learned very early in life the value of thrift and industry and he learned to love and appreciate nature and the out-of-doors.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl continues;— “While living in Christenburg the Christensen children played with the Ole Larsen children next door, Ole Larsen and Laurs Christensen freighted together many a time. The children would walk or ride to Gunnison each week to Sunday School, Primary and Religion Class. Christian became attracted to Caroline Larsen while living there and the two became childhood sweethearts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At age fourteen Christian started working for the man from whom they had leased their farm in Christenburg, Julius Christensen, with his sheep and cattle; for Mr. Christensen was a large sheep and stock owner as well as a land owner. He soon gave young Chris heavy responsibilities, for he knew he was trustworthy. At age nineteen he was put in charge of the sheep herds for his employer and worked on shares, which gave Chris a chance to put in so many sheep for himself each year. This went on for several years.” His brother Albert, during some of this time, was employed by Julius Christensen to run what was called his <span id="page-470"></span> “South Farm” or ranch in Christenburg. He tells about receiving help from Chris there:— “My oldest brother, Chris, was my employer’s foreman over his sheep outfits, but in June when the alfalfa was ready to cut and put up, he came down to the ranch to help with the hay. Later he helped with the grain which was all loaded and stacked by hand.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The year of 1888-89 Albert was given employment with Julius Christensen’s herds, under supervision of his brother Chris. He tells something of their experiences in “The Hard Rich Soil”, from which we quote:— “That spring I went to work for my old employer. I was with the sheep, a lambing herd which lambed on the east slope of the Wasatch Range about due east of the southernmost part of Sanpete County. The sheep were ranged in about the same vicinity until the first part of October 1888. I had charge of one of the two large herds then owned by Mr. Christensen. That fall my employer came to me and asked me if I would continue to work for him during the winter. He said if I would stay with him for one year he would pay me as high a wage as any man he had, except his foreman, Chris. That -was $30 per month; Chris received $35 per month.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our long trip with the sheep was commenced late in October. The herds moved through the southern part of Sanpete County, across part of Sevier County and up to Grass Valley in Piute County, thence south past what is now known as “Bryce Canyon” and from there down to a place then known as “Loseyville”, but now called “Tropic”. We camped a little north of Loseyville on a creek. We had arrived at the campsite about dark. We bedded the sheep near the trail and pitched our camp in a sandy flat on the east bank of the stream. Rain poured down during the night. From our campsite, north and east, the ground gradually rose for about half a mile and then the country broke off into the valley. We could see the sheep apparently feeding along this slope through the forenoon, so we stayed in camp, drying our bedding and clothing. The other herd had passed on ahead. My brother Chris, foreman of that herd, was staying with me and intended to move on the next day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After dinner I started out to go around the <span id="page-471"></span> herd, I discovered to my dismay that what had appeared to be feed was a worthless red weed and what held the sheep down was a plaster-of-paris type of clay that gathered on and stuck to their feet, When a sheep would succeed in extricating one foot from this clay its other three feet would stick fast. I notified my brother Chris of this condition and together we went around the herd. We found that a considerable number of the sheep had crossed over into the swale, or valley, to the east. We also found that a considerable number had moved on to the west. They were in clay up to their sides. We drove what sheep we could back to camp, where the ground was more firm, then we attempted to lift the other sheep out of the mud and place them on firmer ground. We soon discovered that our own feet would sink into the ground and when a foot was pulled out the boot would remain fastened, It was about dark when we got all of the mired sheep back to firmer ground.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next day we worked the marooned sheep over to a small hill where we had to leave them for three or four days before we could get them back with the rest of the herd. One of our burros got into the clay up to her sides. We seemed unable to get her out; so, rather than leave her in the mud to die, we put a chain around her neck and attached a team of horses to pull her out. To our astonishment she came through the ordeal comparatively unscathed. While she was useless until spring, she later assumed her usual burdens. This was the way we celebrated my sixteenth birthday, Dec. 13, 1888. (Chris was twenty-one)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After the herd moved away from the mud country we moved along leisurely… The winter was quite severe. Along about February we were forced to seek lower country. Feb. 28, 1889 was one of the coldest nights I was ever out in. Several sheep were frozen to death. The entire herd was so cold that it failed to leave the bed-ground until about noon of the following day. We moved down into what was locally called “Death Valley”. Day after day came and went. I was up at daylight, had breakfast, followed the sheep out onto the range, generally came back to camp for luncheon, <span id="page-472"></span> then out with the sheep again. About sundown the sheep would move slowly toward the bed-ground, browsing as they went. Returning to camp, I would make a fire and after I cooked supper and washed dishes, I frequently read by campfire light… My brother C. I. Christensen (Chris) was certainly a grand brother and, I may say, a true companion to me. He often came a long way just to stay with me at night.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, the life of a sheepherder could be a lonely one, especially in winters, and it was not an easy one at any time. But under this heavy responsibility  Christian grew strong in physique as well as character. “He was a tall, slender young man with wavy brown hair and grey-blue eyes, but later became heavy”, says his daughter Pearl, “He was very self reliant, with usually a happy smile for everyone - but he could be very strict and stern when the case demanded, though he seldom used strong language. When he was upset with someone his favorite term for such a one was ‘chump head!’ But on the whole Chris had a wonderful way with men - he was a real leader. He was very persuasive, people had difficulty saying no to him. He made friends easily. He loved people and he loved music and he loved to sing and to dance. Some of his favorite songs were ‘Come, Come Ye Saints’, ‘The Star Spangled Banner’, ‘What Will the Robin Do Then, Poor Thing’, and some favorite piano numbers ‘Pure as Snow’, ‘Shepherds Dream’, and ‘Shepherds Evening Song’.” In fact it might be said that Chris loved life, for he had so much that was good to give to it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He married his childhood sweetheart, Caroline  Larsen, 28 Dec. 1893. Pearl continues:— “They were married in Gunnison, with a wedding reception being held at 4 o’clock in the afternoon at the Larsen residence. They were very happy and cherished each other all their lives. Caroline’s father gave them two beautiful horses for a wedding present. One was a sorrel (Old Mormon) and the other a bay mare (Beauty). Christian and Caroline rented their first home, the old Tony King place, a rock house on the east side of Gunnison. They lived there for two years while they built their own</p>

    <p>Their first and last home in Gunnison</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-473"></span> home, which was about two blocks west of Main Street. It was of white rock with five rooms and was tastefully furnished and had handmade carpets throughout. I myself, their oldest child, was a year old when we moved into this home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Soon after we moved in the folks planted shade and fruit trees, berry bushes, flowers and a garden on the place. Since father Christian was away so much of the time, this left a lot of responsibility  to mother Caroline”, An amusing incident is told by their eldest son Elmer, in regard to his father’s long absences from home:— “When I was young, father was away most of the time with the sheep and later, when I was at the ranch or with the sheep myself, he wasn’t there with me either. I remember one time while I was real young and we were still living in Gunnison, he came home one spring after having been out on the desert all winter. His whiskers were long and red and I didn’t know who he was. When he came over and kissed mother I was shocked. After he left I told her I was going to tell father that she let that man with the red whiskers kiss her, but she only laughed. After father came back from the barber shop with the red whiskers all gone, of course I recognized him and told himabout the red whiskered stranger kissing mother - he sure got a kick out of that!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl writes: “Christian’s employer, Julius Christensen, died while still quite young, but Chris was asked to continue working for his company until they sold out, which left him with all the major responsibilities for quite some time. But he was equal to it. After the company sold out, Chris was left with quite a few sheep of his own. Later he bought a few more and then went into the sheep business with Lafe Bown, also of Gunnison. This partnership lasted for many years and was most successful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Lafe and Christian ran their sheep up Twelve Mile canyon in summers and on the west desert in winters, Their company owned a separating  corral south of Fayette, where they separated their sheep both spring and fall. Christian spent many a cold, hard winter going back and forth on the west desert with the sheep. <span id="page-474"></span> He usually traveled in his buckboard. He would put hot rocks in the bottom of it to keep his feet warm and usually he had heavy wool-filled quilts around him to keep out the cold. Many times he would drive all night to keep a promised appointment. Sometimes he would have to camp by a fire or under a cedar tree until it was light enough to find his way. There was little travel on the desert in winter and the going was slow, A trip that would take eight to ten days at that time in a wagon or buckboard can now be made in four or five hours in a car and forty-five minutes by plane.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Christian and Lafe Bown had dependable men that would help them with the sheep, which left them free for their other interests when necessary. Christian’s two younger brothers, Louis and Arthur, worked for him a lot. Besides his sheep and cattle he had a farm on the west side of Gunnison at a place called Clarion. There was always a job to be done there and elsewhere, with harvesting of crops, threshing, getting flour, potatoes and meat in for the winter, and also wood. Besides his own wood supply he hauled extra for needy families and widows, He paid his tithing with such farm products as grain, hay, wheat, flour or cattle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The winters with him away seemed long but the summers were wonderful. Father and our family, Lafe Bown and his family, and other friends and relatives spent many happy summers up Twelve Mile Canyon together. We went riding, hiking, picking wild flowers and berries. We made swings for grown ups and for children and we made large bonfires to gather ‘round in evenings for fun, with singing and dancing. A favorite hike was up Musinia Peak by foot or horseback. Good old sour dough bread and plenty of mutton chops cooked over the open fire or on a camp stove was the food we liked best.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The sheep business paid off for Chris in those days and he was able to save quite a bit of money. Among other things, he was most generous in helping his brothers and sisters get the schooling which he himself had been denied, He was indeed an older brother to be honored and looked up to in <span id="page-475"></span> every sense of the word. Again we quote from his brother Albert’s recollections:— “The four older children of my parents were boys. The oldest was Christian (or Chris or C. I.) then Andrew, Joseph and myself. In the early days, in Mayfield especially, we often roamed the foothills and fields together. Chris generally took the responsibility of my supervision on such occasions. In later years we four were passed off as ‘oldest’ and ‘youngest’ and ‘middle two’, I generally looked to Chris as my ‘big brother’ and a real big brother he was. . , I remember well when I was struggling to get an education. Very frequently there was a shortage of spending money. At one of these critical times my oldest brother (Chris) came to my aid, and that without asking… While I was attending Law School at Ann Arbor, Michigan, my finances were again very limited. I sold some of the things I had at Gunnison, including my rubbertired  buggy and some other articles of which I now have little memory. In the autumn of 1898, when I was about at the point of seeking some help to tide me over my last year, I received a letter from my oldest brother, Chris, or C. I. Christensen, as he then signed his name. This letter has always seemed to me to be somewhat of a miracle, It read, in substance:— ‘Dear Albert, I have just sold a herd of sheep and I am wondering if you won’t need some help to see you through school. If you will let me know about how much you will need a month I will be glad to send it to you.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“No one will ever know how grateful I felt for this message. As a child Chris had always been my ideal and almost my guardian. Now he was turning out to be my savior, materially, as well. Needless to say, I accepted his offer with heartfelt thanks. Thereafter, the needed checks came regularly, Just before graduation he sent a larger check to take care of my graduation and my trip home… Upon returning home I figured I owed the Manti City Savings Bank a total of $700 and interest. My brother Chris had told me while I was at school that he would look after the interest on my note, but I wanted to make such further arrangements as might be necessary. I went to the bank and requested the cashier to look up the <span id="page-476"></span> condition of my account and told him that I would like to get an extension. He left and in a minute he came back and said, ‘You have no loan here; it was paid in full by Chris about a year ago.’. . When I went back to Gunnison a few days later, I called in to thank my brother for what he had done for me and to give him my note. He told me to forget it. When I told him I couldn’t do that, he finally insisted that he would accept nothing more than the principal. ‘You can take what time you want to pay that’, he added. I shall be in Chris’ debt forever.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That’s the kind of fellow Christian “I” Christensen was, and others of his brothers and sisters could have told similar stories about his kindness and helpfulness to them. While a number of these were struggling to get their college educations at B. Y. U. in the early nineties, Chris came to their aid time and time again. His daughter Pearl says: “Christian saved enough money to help his three brothers and one sister through school at Provo. I have been told that at one time he had saved two hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces and he used what was needed of it to help with their educations and also buy new graduation outfits and pay for having their pictures taken.” More has been given about this in an earlier chapter but too much cannot be said about the generosity and charity of this wonderful brother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We continue from Pearl’s history:— “Christian, a strong Republican leader in Gunnison, was active in politics there. He was City Recorder at one time and City Treasurer, and was on the Gunnison School Board of Education for a period of eight years, from 1900 to 1908. He always used to see that everyone had a chance to vote at elections, and helped by picking up in his buggy those who might not otherwise have ways to get to the polls, especially the widows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The 4th and 24th of July were great days for celebration in Gunnison, Christian liked to see that all the children rode in the parade on a big flat-topped wagon; he called them ‘Utah’s Best Crop’. He loved to see everybody having a good time. His little girls were dressed in white silk <span id="page-477"></span> dresses and his little boys in blue pants and blue and white striped shirts, which their mother Caroline made for them. She took pride in sewing for her children. One year Christian was ‘Marshal of the Day’ for one of these big celebrations. He wore a large black Stetson hat with a long ostrich plume which hung down over his shoulder and he rode a black, shiney horse with its mane and tail braided with blue ribbons. We all called the horse ‘Old Black Joe’,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Christmas was another great holiday for our family and both father and mother enjoyed having their children and their relatives and friends around them to help celebrate. Some of the many good features were the wonderful dinners mother cooked and served at those times, as well as on other special occasions such as L. D. S. Conference  times when we usually had visitors at our house, especially after we moved to Salt Lake City.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1908 Chris dissolved his partnership with Lafe Bown and joined with John M. Cannon of Salt Lake City, and other smaller stockholders, in what became known as the “Bennion Livestock Company”. As has been mentioned earlier, this company’s main headquarters was a large ranch on the headwaters of the Weber River in northeastern  Utah, which they called “The Weber”, together with other smaller ranches and accompanying  range lands in the areas. Chris trailed his sheep and other livestock from Twelve Mile in Sanpete County to The Weber, and his brothers Albert and Arthur had some of their sheep trailed up there also, as they became smaller stockholders in this venture. Arthur’s brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill, writes something of this:— “Arthur, after his marriage, was associated with his brother, Albert Christensen, in the sheep business. They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina. After lambing, about July lst, they would move into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months and then winter on the west desert. As I remember, Arthur and his brother Louis took care of the sheep on the desert until the later years. I was herding with Louis on Cedar Mt. one summer when we got <span id="page-478"></span> word to take 1500 head of sheep and start for the Weber River area above Oakley, Utah. Arthur met us above Gunnison and was in charge from there. That was the start of the Bennion Livestock Company in which Arthur, Albert and Chris became  interested. The following year the company bought a ranch at Upton, on Huff Creek, from a Mr. Benson, and Arthur was made foreman of that ranch. The company herders came there for supplies, which were hauled twelve miles by team from Coalville. I lived with Arthur and Millie for a time and worked on that ranch.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chris was up on The Weber in May 1910 when he received word of the serious illness of two of his young daughters. Pearl tells of their deaths:— “In 1910 scarlet fever hit the town of Gunnison and nearly all the children got it. Elora and Orilla took the terrible fever and both died of it within five days of each other. There wasn’t much help for them in those days. Father did not get home before Orilla died but he came a few hours before Elora did. She spoke to him and asked him not to be ‘Woodman’, meaning a member of the Woodmen of the World Lodge. This request he kept. (She also, in her young and innocent way, asked him to take her mother and the children to the Manti Temple and have them all sealed to him as a family, for eternity. This he also promised and was most sincere in it but, like so many, put it off for awhile for more pressing things and never seemed to get around to it.) The funeral services were held on the front lawn of the home. The girls’ caskets were raised so that everyone could see how pretty they were, with Elora’s golden brown hair which covered her like a cape to her knees and Orilla’s reddish-golden curls. Their deaths were such sorrows to our family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Later on that summer father sold most of his interests in Gunnison, including our home which he sold to his brother Arthur, and bought his brother Andrew’s home on 9th East and 27th South in Salt Lake City. (This home has been so well described by Andrew’s daughter Edyth in other chapters of this book.) It was hard on our family at first to move from the country into a big</p>

  <div class="figure" id="image-36"><span id="page-478a"></span> <img alt="Christensen home in Salt Lake City" src="36.png" class="calibre7"/><p>The lovely home in Salt Lake City about the time Chris (I) Christensen purchased it from his brother Andrew in 1910. Pearl, Ivy, Caroline and Roy grouped in front.</p>
</div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-479"></span> city among strangers. But since all the members were very active in the Church at the time, all except father, it didn’t take long before we had made many new friends in the Forest Dale Ward into which we had moved, Mother took part in Relief Society and other church functions, Whenever father was at home he always attended meetings with us, though he was never home long enough to fill a position of responsibility. He held the priesthood and was always a faithful supporter of the L. D. S. Church, in spite of the fact that his business and interests required that he spend most of his time, especially his winters and springs, away from the centers of civilization and his family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He had replaced his buckboard with a Ford pickup truck, which made things easier for him and traveling faster. He traveled so many times in the night to be able to keep his appointments. When he could he took the train to Wyoming and often stayed overnight at the hotel in Carter, trying to get himself cleaned up a little from the grime of travel, or, as he said, ‘taking a bath in a tea cup.’ He spent many days and nights in the terrible cold of Wyoming’s winters. The Carter range was below zero most of the time then.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But summers were different as far as being with his family was concerned. Pearl writes of this:— “For many years, after we moved to Salt Lake, our family spent most of the summers on the ranch owned by the Bennion Livestock Company, called ‘The Weber’. We would move there as soon as school was out in the spring and stay until late fall, except for a trip or two back to Salt Lake to check on the family home and get supplies for ourselves and the hired men, as well as grain for the horses. One of the highlights of these trips back and forth, especially for father, was to stop at the creamery located in the little town of Oakland. Father was extremely fond of buttermilk and was always sure of getting all he could drink of that refreshing beverage whenever he stopped there. It has been stated that his capacity for buttermilk was remarkable.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On the ranch in summers there was always <span id="page-480"></span> plenty of work to be done. Ranch work however was interesting to us children and father seemed to enjoy having us help with such things as separating sheep in the pens and getting lambs ready to trail to market. When it was sheep shearing time at the various shearing corrals, we loved to go along and play on the giant wool sacks. We looked forward to going with father to the many sheep camps scattered throughout the area, for this meant horseback rides through the mountains. The Company owned a small ranch and lambing ground in Chalk Creek Basin east of Coalville and up over the mountain directly north of The Weber. Trips were made there to get horses, etc., and trips were taken to the company ranch at Upton, which was also east of Coalville and where they raised hay and grain and made butter and had a place to feed the company’s horses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“But if this was called ‘work’ there was plenty of time left for fun too. A short distance from the two-story-ranch-house was a small lake called ‘Commisary Lake’. Because this lake had no outlet its waters became quite warm in summertime and thus it became a favorite swimming hole for the entire family. This was fun. It was fun too for the whole family to spend time picking the delicious wild raspberries that abounded in the nearby areas, and make a picnic of it.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian purchased a part of the ranch known as “The Oasis” near Lyman, Wyoming, as we have heard, and about the same time he bought a dry farm in Cedar Valley, west of Lehi, Utah and a fruit farm at LaVerkin, Utah, in the Dixie country, which his brother Andrew had interested him in. It appeared quite evident that he had great hopes for the future and that things ahead looked bright for him indeed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl telis that her father never liked to use the word “goodbye”. It was always just “see you later” or “so long”. As he left his home in Salt Lake City that last time in late September of 1917, he didn’t say “see you later” but simply “so long”. In fact, as he left that last time, he returned from the front gate to the front door three times to say “so long” to his beloved wife, Caroline. That was <span id="page-481"></span> the last time she saw him until she stood by his deathbed at The Oasis in Wyoming the first part of October. The circumstances of Christian’s accident and death have been covered in a previous chapter but we should like to present his daughter Pearl’s courageous and moving account of those also:—</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Father was shot the night of Oct. 2nd 1917, at the ranch, and died there Oct. 5th. He was to have gone up in another direction, but he did not go and of course we didn’t know this. He had cautioned Roy and me to shoot for help if we saw anything moving in the area. I feel that I was at fault as much as Roy, although he held the gun, for just as he fired in the air from the doorway the screen door I was trying to hold open for him flew shut on the gun, putting the shot onto father. Of course we didn’t know at the time that it was father. All we knew was that we could see someone moving in our yard, that we had been told to shoot for help in such a case, and that we were frightened. I guess this was just supposed to be - just one of those things. This has been so terrible for us to live with. As for me, I can hardly stand to talk about it even now, after more than fifty years. We all loved our father so dearly!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He lived three days after he was shot in the back. The bullet lodged in his chest and ricocheted so badly that they dared not move him, except into the ranch house. He suffered terribly. He talked to us and forgave us with all his heart and soul, because he knew we did not mean to do it. We were just carrying out his orders to shoot for help if we saw anything moving. They embalmed him at the ranch and then we took his body on the train to be further prepared for burial. Then we took his body on to Gunnison where his funeral and burial were held, 12 Oct. 1917.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sensitive people sometimes seem to die a little themselves with experiences such as these; but life must go on for them nevertheless, for they too “have promises to keep and miles to go before they sleep - and miles to go before they sleep”. Christian’s descendants should take comfort in his nobleness of character and the examples he <span id="page-482"></span> set for them in service to his fellowmen. (Has it not been said in the scriptures - “For he that hath done it unto the least of these, my brethren, hath done it unto me”.) Truly he was a doer of good as well as a leader among men. Though he had little opportunity for formal schooling, yet he was an educated man with an educated heart - a great and passionate heart. That one of his main goals was to give his wife and children the better things of life and leave them all well fixed, there can be no doubt. For this he worked and labored hard, sacrificing his own comfort. One cannot do everything but Christian did much. He was a man of action.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caroline Larsen (Christensen) wife of Christian “I” Christensen, was born in Christenburg, Sanpete, Utah 7 Apr. 1871, the daughter of Ole Hansen Larsen and Inger Olsen (Larsen) early Utah Pioneers. She was baptized a member of the L. D. S. Church in the Sanpitch River which ran near her home, in the early spring following her eighth birthday. Her father was a farmer and a freighter in those early Gunnison Valley days. Caroline and her brothers and sisters helped on the farm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pearl tells of her mother:— “Caroline gleaned wheat with her mother, Inger, and others, and her little bare feet would get so sore. Her mother would wash and oil them and wrap them up in rags. Many a night the small girl cried in pain. Shoes were very hard to get at those times. Caroline had one pair for church and Sunday School, ‘Sunday shoes’ they were called. This one pair of little shoes she treasured very much. She was about ten years old before she had shoes to wear all of the time. The Larsen children and others from Christenburg had a long way to go to church and Sunday School, Primary, Religion Class and also school, for they had to go to Gunnison, several miles away.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Caroline was a happy natured child and loved to help her mother. She loved to sit by her side and sew. When she had a few pennies she would <span id="page-483"></span> buy a piece of calico and make quilt blocks, and by the time she was thirteen years old she had pieced the tops for three quilts. She was eager to learn and besides sewing she loved music and painting. When she grew older she did a number of beautiful paintings. She was very talented with her hands. She was a beautiful seamstress and an excellent cook. She learned to card wool, make rugs, quilt, make butter and cheese and soap and cure meat, and all the other early household arts that prepared her to manage a successful home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Caroline and her brothers and sisters and friends, including the Christensen children next door, loved to swim in the Sanpitch River back of their barn in what they called ‘The Big Hole’. It was here that her little sister, Josephine, age four, was drowned. They found her little body a mile down stream. The Larsen and Christensen children, as neighbors, played together at many things and Caroline Larsen and Christian Christensen became childhood sweethearts while in Christenburg.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Caroline was about fifteen years old her father built a lovely home in Gunnison, where they went to live in winters though they continued to spend most of their summers on the farm in North Christenburg. The first winter in their new home her little brother Peter and sister Hanner died of diphtheria during an epidemic.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Caroline grew to be a beautiful young lady. She was dainty and small of stature with lovely blond hair and blue eyes, She was also soft spoken, modest and gentle in nature - and she was kind, She and Christian continued their courtship which resulted in their marriage, 28 Dec. 1893, when he was twenty-six and she was nearing twenty-three. The bride wore a pretty robin-egg blue satin dress and orange blossoms in her beautiful long blond hair. She made a lovely wife and mother. The couple had eight children, four girls and four boys: Pearl Eva, Inger Elora, Giles Elmer, Christian LeRoy, Orilla, Myrtle Ivy, Farrald DeLong, and Gorden Larsen Christensen. <span id="page-484"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Caroline received word of Christian’s fatal accident she was frantic. Mr. Cope, secretary for the Bennion Livestock Company, took her to Wyoming to be near him, immediately, in his car. She left the three younger children, Ivy, Farrald and little Gorden, at home alone, with a kind neighbor, Mrs. Seegmiller, to look out for them if things went wrong. Pearl and Roy were of course at the ranch and Elmer was on the farm in Cedar Valley but soon joined the others. Caroline was at Christian’s bedside to bid him ‘so long’ when the end came for him. His brother Louis and sister Elsie and her two girls, and Bishop Clarence Rollins of Lyman, Wyoming were on the train with Caroline, Pearl and Roy when they brought the body to Salt Lake City. Mr. Cope met them at the station and did everything he could to help out. The body was taken to the old Taylor Mortuary, then on West Temple and First South. The others went on to Gunnison where they were joined by their families, as well as relatives and friends from both Wyoming and Utah. But Caroline and her children stayed several days in Salt Lake making preparations and then all went down with the body, to join the others for Christian’s funeral and burial.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About two months later, 5 Dec. 1917, Caroline took her children to the Salt Lake Temple and had the necessary endowments and the sealing of the family for eternity taken care of - all but Pearl, who was then beyond the proper age. They were accompanied by Christian’s parents, Laurs and Else K. Christensen. (Pearl had her own endow- ments and was sealed to her parents some forty- one years after, 26 June 1959, also in the Salt Lake Temple.) Caroline herself went to the temple often after that wonderful experience there that December 1917, and continued to do so up until three weeks before her death. She loved the church and was a faithful attender to her duties as a member. She had a strong testimony of the divinity of the Gospel and her faith never wavered throughout all the trials and tribulations of her widowhood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caroline and Christian had been married almost twenty-four years when he died, Just over <span id="page-485"></span> twelve years later her youngest son passed away, lacking three months of his eighteenth birthday, 9 Jan. 1930, Christian had been well insured and owned much property, which was soon sold. His part of The Oasis, where he died, was purchased by his brother Louis. The family would have been left in fairly good circumstances had not the tender hearted Caroline made some rather substantial loans for which, through unforeseen circumstances, she was never reimbursed, She herself died 8 June 1941, two months and one day following her seventieth birthday, having outlived Christian over twenty-three and a half years, during which time she continued to live in her own home in Salt Lake City. Following is part of an article which was published in the Deseret News at the time of her death.</p>
