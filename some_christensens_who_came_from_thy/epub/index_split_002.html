  <h1 class="calibre2" id="preface">PREFACE <span class="calibre3" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-v" title="v"></span></h1>

  <p class="calibre1">The record of forty-years has been inscribed on the Scroll of Time since I first became interested in the history of our Christensen family. As I look back now it seems to be inevitable that I should write this history. I was driven to it by urgings beyond my own. Several experiences, three of which I relate here, have highlighted my interest and spurred me on.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shortly after the death of Grandfather Laurs Christensen, his and Else K. Christensen’s joint Temple Record Book came unexpectedly into my keeping. From time to time I thumbed through its well recorded pages noting the lists of dates, names and places. Vital statistics about unfamiliar people can seem dead and uninteresting; yet, to me, each browse through the record spiced my enthusiasm. I experienced a growing awareness that I was somehow deeply involved in those strange Danish names and places. Being a frequent procrastinator, however, I put the book aside during lengthy intervals. But that tenacious feeling of involvement and responsibility persisted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another experience affected me profoundly. I described it in an entry in my journal dated July 7, 1933: “Today has been a glorious day for me! At 9:00 a.m. I entered the LDS Church Historian’s office in Salt Lake City in hopes of contacting Assistant Church Historian, Andrew Jenson. I had been told he had been a passenger on the same ship that carried my Christensen grandparents and great-grandparents from Denmark to America in 1866. Upon learning of my mission, Brother Jenson, then in his 82nd year, greeted me cordially and said that he remembered my Danish ancestors well. (He had been fifteen years old when he and they had come to America together.) He had kept a day-by-day account of the voyage and had recently translated it from Danish to English. Although he was very busy on this day, Brother Jenson turned <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-vi" title="vi"></span> the translation over to me and, seating me at his desk, allowed me to make a copy of that portion of his diary pertaining to the voyage. He said that I would be the first to do so. Brother Jenson produced large maps of Denmark and pointed out places of interest to me. I thanked him and began to copy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Feverishly I wrote. Boundaries between the past and present seemed to disappear. Day by day, across the great Atlantic. I experienced with my precious forebearers all the newness, excitement, anxieties and sorrows of that difficult and memorable journey. This was one of the most thrilling genealogical experiences I had encountered. Only those who have known the exhiliration of discovery can appreciate my feelings at being thus “caught up”. I was astonished when they announced it was 4:30 p.m. and closing time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Again, in the spring of 1958, a little over a year after father’s death (Albert H. Christensen), the telephone rang. Aunt Myrtle, my dear “second mother” was on the line. She had been cleaning out the basement of the old home in Orem preparatory to offering the house for sale. Midst the clutter and trash, the coal dust and spider webs, she had found an old dilapidated brown satchel. Apparently, upon Grandfather Laurs Christensen’s death, some 30 years before, the satchel had been entrusted to father’s care, but very soon found its way into basement storage and was forgotten. Its contents were musty and dirty. Aunt Myrtle picked up the bag gingerly, took it out into the backyard intending to consign it to the flames of a bonfire already consuming other discarded rubbish. But something stayed her hand. She put the satchel on the back porch. The next morning she made a cursory examination of its contents but found nothing of interest to her. At that point she was prompted to call me and ask if I wanted the dirty old thing. Did I!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Recessed in its cracked, musty interior were small journals, old letters in a foreign language, and precious documents of the past, glimpses into <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-vii" title="vii"></span> the lives and activities of loved ones long departed. Preserved by the kind hand of Providence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Several weeks later, when eighty-seven year old Aunt Elsie Bartholomew came to visit, I placed the satchel on the rug in front of her without a word of explanation. “Why my goodness,” she exclaimed excitedly, “that’s mother’s old kit! I haven’t seen it for sixty years. That’s the kit mother used to keep her medical instruments in. It sat by her bedroom door day and night for years and years, always packed and ready at a moment’s notice whenever a call came for her to go tend the sick or dying, or to bring another baby into the world.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When I received the “kit” it contained no medical instruments, but things far more precious to me. Apparently, after Grandmother’s doctoring days were over, the “kit” had become the depository for her treasures. There were old Danish letters, some over seventy years old, from Grandmother’s three sisters, one brother, and others of her relatives in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I want it thoroughly understood that the second part of this book is the story of Grandmother Else’s childhood and youth, of which we have known so little; for while she could have told it herself we were not listening. I have taken the liberty to put it into dramatic form, interweaving fact with fiction - binding fiction together with many facts. The Danish letters helped so much with this. I feel that Grandmother Else K. was a great character and we will probably remember her best if we bring her to life during this period of her existence. To my knowledge I have not altered the truth in any degree. The historical background can be well documented. The characters are real. If I have offended any I hope to have the opportunity to apologize.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I cannot claim that there are no errors in this book. The writing itself has taken me over two-and-a-half years. Some writers have been censured for overlooking unconsciously or intentionally the darker dissonances of their subjects. I have tried to present both sides.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those of us who are living today are witnessing the birth of a new era. A far different era than the one our parents and grandparents knew. The era into which we were born is about to pass away. I recall the words of the educator, Max Rafferty: “Today the hammer of accelerating time is beating on the great anvil of the world with ever increasing brashness and insistency. Sparks are flying from the whole surface. The point of no return is past.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are indeed approaching a very new and different world - a challenging world - a wonderful world - a frightening world; and in this new world the Christensens who are left have a great heritage as well as a significant responsibility. As I have assembled material for this book my appreciation and love for my cousins, relatives and Christensen progenitors has increased an hundred fold. If I were to dedicate this book, however, it would be to my children and grandchildren with deepest affection. I am proud and grateful to have been able to contribute a few measures of understanding to the lives of those who are to follow. We must all go forward with firm resolve, devotion and courage to make this a better world.</p>
