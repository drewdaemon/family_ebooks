  <p class="calibre1">(66) Kathryn Christensen (4) has written her own history:- “I was born on August 21, 1929 at the Crane Maternity Home in Provo, Utah. Mother had turned forty-four a few weeks earlier and Dad was fifty-six. My earliest recollections date back to the old home in Orem, 1158 South State Street, where I lived until I was married at twenty-one. Earliest memories include glimpses of my grandmother Farnsworth’s death as a result of having fallen out of the bedroom back porch, various cat and dog pets and the bad ends to which each came in its own time, the thrill of getting an indoor bathroom, the rhythm of the twin Dexter washing machine every Monday morning; but, most of all, the delight I felt when Elaine and Ted, Virginia and Dan, or Lois and Sherm would bring their children ‘home” so I could play with them. For many, many years I think that Donna Southwick, Colleen Keeler and Kent Christensen were the most beloved friends that I had. During these early years of memory, houses were few and far between in Orem, and although mother spent hours reading to me, sewing for my dolls, playing dominos etc., it seems that I was always hungry for child companionship. Phil, Cullen and Norma, the only ones that ever lived in that home, were all so much ahead of me. Family reunions at the canyon where all of us children (my nieces and nephews) stood Sherm and Phil in various tag games and where that lucky Colleen always won the box of miniature chocolates for having the most freckles, were the highlights of my childhood. The hours and hours that Kent and I spent digging up “doodle bugs” and hunting for spiders for our collection will never be forgotten, The summer or summers that Dan Keeler Jr. spent with us <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-965" title="965"></span> there in Orem are bright spots of memory.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Duties of childhood were certainly reasonable. Working in the garden with Dad, helping Mother to can fruit and vegetables, occasional dishes and housecleaning seem to have left lots of time for what friends could be gathered from far and near. I did pick strawberries, raspberries and other fruits for Virgil Cordner, Philo Edwards and Wilford Stubbs, for this is the way I earned my spending money. I preferred picking fruit to baby sitting greatly since my first couple of experiences at that were so ghastly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Grade school memories have condensed down to glimpses of my teachers, my playmates, and a general feeling that I did well. Junior high school was a thrill for many reasons. I met, for the first time, another child Republican other than Jeanine Watkins. Other Republicans from the Lake View and Vineyard areas were encountered for the first time. It was during this first year in Jr. High school that I became acquainted with most of the sweet friends that were to be my dearest and most constant companions all of the way through high school: Jeanine Watkins, Marilyn Christensen, Alene Edwards, Donna Christensen, Myrlene Smith, Carol Stubbs, Beth Jones, Joan Stewart, Marie Rohbock, Marjorie Clemens, Pat Yager, and for a few years, Katherine Tapp. We called ourselves ‘The Terrible Twelve’ and for the years when Katherine Tapp lived in the area, ‘The Icky Thirteen’; but as I look back upon our activities we must have been the most innocent teenagers imaginable. Our parents gave us a great deal of freedom, partly because they all knew each other and because, in my memory at least, we never disappointed them. We had such fun times at the Girls’ Home, Carl Young’s cabin, the various school activities and the many parties at our homes. It became a tradition to have a sleeping party just before Christmas. The first one was at our home. All of these girls were active in studentbody affairs and had such delightful personalities. I count these marvelous friends as some of my greatest blessings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In junior high and high school, in addition <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-966" title="966"></span> to my activity in music, I had the lead in some school plays; was president of the Junior Organized Club of Service in 9th grade; a member and vice-president of the Tigerettes, the pep club; society editor for the Livewire, the school paper, and my senior year was editor; Junior Prom committee member; and chairman of the Graduation Committee for the class of 1947. I was a graduate of Seminary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I must have started taking piano lessons around 3rd grade. Mother and Dad were very encouraging and gave me every opportunity. I took from Clair Reid for several years, Melba Pyne for a short time, Elmer Nelson for a concentrated summer, and finally from Carl Feurstner for a short time. I believe that all of us came to the conclusion finally that I did develop what talent I had and that it was not impressive. Somewhere around the 7th or 8th grade Mother and Dad noticed that I enjoyed singing very much and sent me to Allie Clark for vocal lessons. She was the only teacher I ever studied with so I have no way of knowing how fine a teacher she was, but it was a very interesting experience. Opportunities came often to do all that I had time to do in music. Mr. E. B. Terry did so much for me. He had me accompany various glee clubs and choruses and let me sing some soprano solos in the community presentation of ‘The Messiah’ for several years. It was Mother who was instrumental in the formation of a vocal trio with Carol Stubbs, soprano; Marie Rohbock, alto; and myself singing 2nd soprano. Once we got started, Mr. Terry and especially Stanley R. Gunn, one of our seminary teachers, saw that we had countless opportunities to perform. Mr. Gunn was asked to speak at sacrament meetings often and nearly always invited our trio to go along with him to furnish the music for the program. Often we sang at two Sacrament meetings a week. Up to the present time I feel that this was the finest singing group to which I have ever belonged. We were all trained by Mrs. Clark and must have sung together for three or more years. I sang with Geniel Larsen and Birdene Terry for quite some time and this trio sang with the Mendelssohn Chorus directed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-967" title="967"></span> by E. B. Terry. Every place I have gone since high school I have been involved with music in the church in various capacities. A sextette in Washington D. C., of which I was a member, sang extensively in that area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My church jobs started early. I believe that we were in the eighth grade when Marilyn Christensen and I traded off being chorister and organist for the Junior Sunday School in the old Timpanogos Ward. I may have been still in high school when I was made Junior Sunday School Coordinator. I was music director in MIA for one year and then back to Jr. Sunday School in various capacities until 1955-56 when, as a married woman, our family moved to Hyattsville, Maryland, where Bishop June B. Thayne said to me, ‘We have three jobs open, which one would you like?’ I’ll never forget that bishop! One of the jobs was ward choir director, which I chose. Other than directing a Golden Gleaner chorus in Orem this was my first opportunity to direct a choir. Since then I have directed them in almost every ward in which I have lived. I have also taught Primary for several years and in Palo Alto taught the fifteen and sixteen year olds in Sunday School. I became a Golden Gleaner while still in college.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I attended Brigham Young University from 1947 to 1951 where I graduated with a B.A. degree in elementary education. At first I thought that I’d major in speech and dramatics since I had enjoyed being in plays directed by L. L. Terry in high school. I soon changed to music as a major, then to English as a major and then, to be practical, I went into elementary educatio. English literature is, I suppose, my first love now. While at the BYU I was a member of O.S. Trovata social unit and was president of that organization during my junior year. I was a member of the student council as senior class representative my last year. I was awarded membership in Phi Kappa Phi and graduated with honors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I was married on June 5, 1951 to Albert Charles Todd Jr. the day after graduation. Bert was a returned missionary from Czechosolovakia <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-968" title="968"></span> and was finishing his junior year at the Y. He was a political science major, was a good student and an inspirational speaker. He was asked to teach Russian language for our next two years at the Y. We lived first in the basement of a garage near to the campus and then moved to Wymount Village. Albert Paul Todd was born in February 1953. He was named Albert for Bert, Bert’s father, my father, and Albert Kent Christensen, all of whom assisted in his blessing. Robert Ord and Melvin Mabey assisted also. Bert finished his MA in the summer of 1953. In August of 1953 we moved to Arlington, Virginia so that Bert could do his graduate work at Georgetown University. I taught school during this time. We lived in the upstairs apartment above Wynn’s Fabric Store on Fairfax Drive in Arlington. Dixie Reid Christensen, who lived only a few blocks away, secured our apartment and tended Paul for two years and in general was our mother away from home.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the summer of 1955 Bert lost his Senate Post Office patronage job due to the loss of Republican strength in the legislature. Because he had finished his classwork and my salary continued through the summer we moved for the summer to Cambridge, Mass., where we lived in Holden Green and thoroughly enjoyed the association of Kent and Betsy Christensen while Bert studied at the Weidner Library. Both Betsy and I were expecting babies in November (Peter and Ann). In the fall we returned to the Washington, D. C. area of Kent Village in Hyattsville, Maryland, because Bert had taken a position of teacher of Russian History at Gallaudet College for the deaf. There Gaylen Peter was born in November 1955. It was while living there that, through some genealogy work, I located Bert’s father’s family in Kansas - all alive except one brother. Bert and I met Dad Todd in Kansas where we saw Dad meet his brothers and sisters after fifty years. I got an amazing amount of genealogy and it was a thrilling experience. In June of 1956 Bert changed jobs and began working for the Air Force as a Russian specialist at the Pentagon so we moved to Fort Strong Apartments in Arlington, Virginia. I taught school again and Bert’s mother, Delila Folsom Todd, stayed the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-969" title="969"></span> school year with us to care for Paul and Peter (Gaylen, then). Dad Todd and she were in he throes of selling their hydroponics plant near Las Vegas. During this year my own father died and I returned to Utah for a week or so to be with Mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In November 1957 Jeanmiarie was born. About six weeks earlier Peter had rolled off his lower bunk bed and had fractured his clavicle. He had been put in a cast from the waist up. The next morning Paul (4½) and I took him for a walk in the stroller. Paul saw a bird bath in a yard and, thinking that it was a water fountain, tried to pull himself up to get a drink. The mounting was rusted and the huge mass of cement fell on his leg giving him a bad break in the growth-line in the knee. Fortunately a service station attendant saw the accident and helped me get him to a doctor. It was necessary for him to wear a cast from the waist to toe on one leg and from the waist to the knee on the other leg. Mother Christensen rose to the occasion and boarded an airplane for the first time to come to help me, since I was eight months pregnant with two small children in casts. She stayed until spring. On February 14, 1958 Mother Todd died of a cerebral hemmorhage in Conway, Arkansas, as she and Dad were coming to visit us and to see the new baby girl. Dad Todd did come a little later after the funeral, to fill the void of Mother Todd’s death with this new baby.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1958 Bert was selected to go to the Soviet Union for a year of study, by the University Travel Grant Committee. In preparation for this great opportunity the family, with Dad Todd, moved to Middlebury, Vermont for the summer so that Bert could attend a concentrated Russian language session. We rented a fascinating old home with two kitchens, eleven rocking chairs, two stuffed deer heads and a decorative but real wasp nest in the library. Many friends came to visit us there. Our furniture had been stored in Washington D. C., so at the end of the summer we moved directly to Orem where the children and I stayed with Mother Christensen while Bert spent the year studying at Moscow University. It was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-970" title="970"></span> with great excitement and anticipation that we looked forward to this opportunity. I taught school at the Hillcrest School in Orem. I took Russian at night for one quarter but found that the schedule was too demanding to continue. I did get lots of genealogy work done that year with the help of Virginia Keeler. Mother cared for the three children with the help of a lady who did the cleaning and the ironing. In May 1959 Dad Todd came from California to help Mother with the children while I joined Bert in Moscow for a six week tour of the Soviet Union with him and the other American students and wives. This had been the first exchange of students through the University Travel Grant committee. On the tour we visited Moscow, Leningrad, Tiblise, Sochi, Yalta, Odessa and Kiev. We traveled by train, bus and airplane. This was not the usual tourist journey. We were given considerable freedom and all of the students spoke fluent Russian by that time. On our return trip we stopped at Warsaw, East and West Berlin, Paris, and London. After picking up the three children in Utah we returned to Washington D. C. where we stayed in Ralph Mecham’s home until we found an apartment in Cambridge, Mass., where Bert had been offered a two year fellowship at the Russian Research Center at Harvard University. At first we lived in an apartment at Sitko’s just off Massachusetts Avenue but after Phil was born in July 1960 we moved to an apartment two stories above Pop’s Liquor Store on Western Avenue in Allston, Mass. Our association with Kent and Betsy Christensen these two years was delightful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In September 1961 Bert accepted a joint appointment at Indiana University in the Slavic Languages and Literatures Department and in the History Department. We rented a large university owned home just off campus. Dad Todd came to live with us for one year, but health required that he leave Indiana. During the first year there in Indiana I ran ‘The Princess Playschool’ for four and five year old girls so that Jeanmarie would have some friends and to help pay for the grand piano that I had purchased. I had seven little girls for two hours five days a week. During all of the time in Indiana it was quite obvious that our <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-971" title="971"></span> marriage would not survive the strains of changed goals and ideals. The Russian experience proved to be disadvantageous to our marriage. During the summer of 1962 I went back to school in earnest. Bert was in Russia most of this summer and several other times during these years in Indiana. I received much help from the Evan Memmott family. They, with eight children, were living in a large trailer house while Evan was obtaining his PhD degree. During this summer their oldest daughter, Mary Lee, brought several of her younger brothers and sisters over to my large house and tended them and my children while I went to school and Brother and Sister Memmott typed his dissertation. In the fall Mother came to care for the children while I went full time to school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I majored in Library-Science. In the spring I flew to Palo Alto, California for a job interview. and signed a contract as an elementary school librarian with the Palo Alto Unified School District. I had had job offers for Seattle Public Library, the University of California at Santa Barbara, public school at Lompoc, California, and one in Oregon. I had been invited to stay at Indiana University as librarian for their new elementary library at their training school there. I chose Palo Alto largely because Kent and Betsy Christensen lived there at the time and the salary offered was exceptionally good. Betsy and Grandpa Todd found a home for me and purchased it with some of Dad Todd’s and Mother Christensen’s money in June. Betsy and Dad repainted it and had it all ready for us when we arrived in August of 1963; I was grantedi a divorce on August 1, 1963. Bert was in Russia at the time. I finished my MAT degree on August llth and we moved the next day. We drove in convoy with Tom Moon as far as Salt Lake City where a family gathering at Reed and Norma Webster’s welcomed us home. A few days later. I drove on to Palo Alto where we found the first home ever to belong to us ready and waiting for us. Mother remained in Salt Lake City.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My job in Palo Alto entailed going to five schools a week to train student librarians, teach library skill, give book talks and literature <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-972" title="972"></span> enrichment, etc. In addition there was a great amount of reading for selecting library materials for the district. After the first year I had fewer schools and was one of the co-chairmen of book selectio. The fourth year I was chairman of Book Selection and chairman of the Elementary Library Department. Dad Todd cared for the children the first year and a half, and Mother cared for them the next two years. I received a great deal of help from Mother and Dad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“These were busy years in Palo Alto and except for Betsy and Kent and some close girl friends, especially June Martin, there was not much time or opportunity for social life since I taught summer school and took evening classes during the winter. However, I decided to try to go to London and Paris as a chaperon with Foreign Language League with June Martin in the summer of 1966. In between our planning and the actual trip, June had been introduced to Dr. Melvin Mabey (by me) from BYU, a close friend of mine whose wife, Janet, had been killed a year earlier leaving nine children. After a beautiful and short courtship they had been married. June, feeling obligated to go to London with me and the group she had recruited, did come for a time; but seeing that all was going well with our group and being needed at home, she returned to Provo. The six weeks in London and Paris with a group of teenagers, including Reed and Norma’s Kay, was really a delightful experience; partly because I had met Dr. B. Delworth Gardner in Salt Lake City just a few days before leaving for London. (He was a professor of economics at Utah State University.) I was able to share my experiences there with him through letters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had met Del through my bishop in Palo Alto, John Hopkin and his wife Bonnie, who is a distant cousin of Del’s. Bishop Hopkin had written Del early in May telling him about me. Although he had replied that ‘his heart was not ready’, since his divorce was very recently granted, when I went to Salt Lake City in June to leave Peter and Jeanmarie with Reed and Norma Webster, the Hopkins, through June Martin Mabey, informed Del where I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-973" title="973"></span> was staying. We met at the home of Neal and Colleen Maxwell and were both immediately impressed. We had several dates before I left for California and on to Europe, including a day or so at Jackson Hole with the Websters and friends for the Fourth of July. We were both rather confident that this was a highly desirable relationship. After writing for the six weeks while I was away in Europe, several weeks from Palo Alto to Logan and six weeks while Del was in Ecuador and Bolivia with intermittent visits between, the marriage date was moved up from March to June to December. We were married in the Oakland Temple on December 17, 1967, honeymooned in Sausalito, returned to Palo Alto two days later for an open house at Kent and Betsy’s, and moved immediately to Logan where we had purchased a house two weeks earlier. Utah friends and family honored us and welcomed us graciously.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In purchasing the house we had in mind buying one large enough for Del’s three children, who were with their mother, and my four. We found just the perfect house and furnished it from the beginning for seven children. The hoped for but unexpected opportunity to have the three Gardner children - Naunie Marie, Brigg, and Bruce - came in mid-February when their mother called from Reno saying that we could have them at least for the school year. So nine sat about our big round (now oval) table that I brought from Indiana, seven single beds filled the four large children’s bedrooms, and life looked to be very full and joyful and challenging. How long we will remain in Logan is indefinite because Del has several interesting offers other places, but life seems beautifully full and choice here in this lovely little valley. The past seems full of great blessings and some heart aches, but brothers, sisters, other family, and dear friends have long since helped to melt the latter away. The present with Del is so delightful and the future looks so very bright, I remain awed at the blessings of the Lord.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During the late summer of 1967 I was asked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-974" title="974"></span> to teach Library Science courses at Utah State University. The professor who was in charge of teaching these courses was given a grant to finish his PhD, and the department of Instructional Media and Library Science was in need of a person for one year. Dr. Milton C. Abrams, University Librarian, recommended me to the department. Although we now had all seven children with us, the opportunity to try my hand at this level of teaching for a limited time seemed worth the effort. I was made an assistant professor and asked to teach Use of Libraries and Library Materials, Reading Guidance, Secondary School Library Administration, Cataloging and Classification, and Elementary School Library Administration, as well as to do all counselling of students with Library Science interests. The head of the department was Dr. Lester C. Essig whom I had known at Indiana University. The third member of the department was Dr. Don C. Smellie whom I had also known at Indiana U. I was encouraged by these men and assured that I had a place here at the University as long as I was here. Their cooperation and encouragement made it a challenging but rewarding and a successful year professionally.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“But for some time Resources For the Future, an organization of mostly economists funded by the Ford Foundation, had been anxious to have my husband, Del, come to Washington D. C. to do some thinking about what the quality of life in rural America will be around the turn of the century. So we have decided to accept this challenge this year (1968/69). It looks as if it will be a marvelous year professionally for Del, and all seven children are anxious and able to join with us for a year near the nation’s capitol.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kathryn, Del and family left for the Washington D. C. area in September 1968. After almost a year of delightful and successful experiences there they are now preparing to return to Logan this September, 1969.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kathryn’s husband, Brigham Delworth Gardner, was born 7 Sep. 1928 in Afton, Wyoming, the son of Brigham Delos and Camera Lorean <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-975" title="975"></span> Hepworth Gardner. His children by a former marriage are Brigham Ebb Gardner, born 1 Nov. 1952 in Laramie, Wyoming; Naunie Marie Gardner, born 19 July 1954 in Salmon, Idaho; and Bruce Barrus Gardner, born 18 Nov. 1957 in Ft. Collins, Colorado.</p>
