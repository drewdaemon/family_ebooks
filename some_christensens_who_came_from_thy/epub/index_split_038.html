  <p class="calibre1">Joseph, third son of Laurs and Else K. Christensen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah Tuesday 7 Mar. 1871. He was christened plain Joseph, but in early manhood he assumed the middle initial “C” which he seldom ever used, and changed the last part of the original spelling of his surname from “sen” to “son”, unofficially however. When he was going on four years old he and his father, mother and two older and one younger brother moved a few miles southeast from Gunnison to North Mayfield, where they joined in the “United Order” experiment. When the “Order” dissolved the family moved across Twelve Mile Creek to South Mayfield and his father bought a home there. This home is still standing and in good condition (1968).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph received his first lessons in reading, spelling and numbers at his mother’s knee, while she was spinning, weaving, knitting or doing other household tasks. He first attended school in South Mayfield and excelled as a student.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Accounts of him and his brothers roaming the hills there, swimming in Twelve Mile Creek, riding their Indian pony, helping on their father’s farm and even raiding the Bishop’s watermelon patch, are given in earlier pages of this book. Fishing was another thing he enjoyed in Mayfield, and visiting nearby Indian camps to wrestle with young Indian boys his own age. He was a strong, well-built young fellow. There were cold winters</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-515"></span> in Mayfield when their stock died and difficult times when the family had little to eat. But there was always plenty of love and kindness to go around in his family and very little squabbling.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The family moved back to Gunnison when Joseph was nine years old (1880) and he was baptized a member of the L. D. S. Church there later on that year. His Danish mother wrote about this in her journal:— “Joseph Christensen, fød (born) den 7 March 1871 i Gunnison, døbt (baptized) den 25 July 1880, af (by) Thomas William Hansen og (and) Konfermeret (confirmed) af P. W. Blom, samme dag (same day).” Of all of Laurs and Else Christensen’s sons Joseph was perhaps the most consistent in his attendance and activity in the church. Possibly it was because his work didn’t take him away from home as much as the others. However, he was of a rather solemn and determined nature.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph attended grade school in Gunnison. He had an experience with one of his teachers one year, of which his brother Albert writes, (This took place in early spring of 1888):— “My brother Joseph, who was just older than I, looked after the firing of the stove at school with my help. It was our duty to have the school rooms warm in the mornings and during the school days. That school year was especially short for the two of us. Joseph and two other boys about his age, Frank Metcalf and Arthur Johnson, had broken some rule of the teacher, Oscar Berglund. Perhaps it was a failure to be properly prepared or something of that sort. By way of punishment they had been ordered to copy a certain number of pages from a certain book before going home from school. These pupils apparently had some understanding between themselves that they would refuse to write the verses. I hadn’t been advised by Joseph that he would not write the verses, so I remained on the school ground to wait for him. The teacher had a large ruler, or stick, which he used to support his authority. He was a man of more than usual determination and this was perhaps the first time such determination had really been put to the test.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The teacher first went to Metcalf, as I was <span id="page-516"></span> later told, and gave him the choice of taking a licking or writing the verses. Berglund was a big man and he had a big stick. As he stood there with the ultimatum to write ‘or else’ it was too much for Metcalf; he commenced to write. When Johnson was confronted with decision after having seen the surrender of his ally, he also commenced to write. The teacher was wise in not taking Joseph on first, for when he was given the alternative he refused to write. ‘Hold out your hand’ the teacher commanded, Joseph’s hand came out without hesitation. There were three vicious whacks! Joseph’s hand remained out but the teacher turned and walked to his desk. Joseph took his hat and his books and started for the door, and as he walked past the desk he threw the school keys down. That was the end of that school year for both of us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We notified our mother that we had quit school. Notwithstanding her urging us to go back we stood firm. She didn’t belabor or command us but said, gently and firmly, ‘You will then grub and burn the greasewood on the north of the forty.’ This we proceeded to do in spite of the development of blistered hands and sunburned faces and necks.” This must have been double punishment for Joseph since he usually liked school so much. He loved to learn and during his leisure moments one seldom saw him without a book in his hands.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The summer of 1889 or 1890 Joseph and Albert worked on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad which was being brought into Sanpete County. They secured jobs with one William Harris, a contractor who had a contract to construct the grade between Sterling and Gunnison. Mr. Harris finished his job in Sanpete County early in the summer and moved from there to the vicinity of Eureka. After his outfit moved, Joseph and his brother got jobs from a man by the name of Crandall, who had a contract finishing the grade south of the Harris job. They ran scrapers, drove teams and were somewhat looked down upon at times by the hot-headed Irishmen who operated the big drillers and shovels. But no matter; the money they earned was used to further their educations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph worked in summers but in winters he <span id="page-517"></span> went to school. He graduated from the Gunnison Public Schools with high honors and then took a preparatory course at the Snow Academy at Ephraim, Utah. It became his ambition to achieve a high standing in the educational world and to this his efforts were devoted. His mother went to Denmark the early fall of 1890 to see her people, and that winter Joseph attended the Gunnison Seminary which was-sponsored by the L. D. S. Church school system. In the autumn of 1891, with two brothers and a sister, he entered the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, Utah, where they hoped to obtain their college degrees. All four of them - Andrew, Albert, Elsie and Joseph - eventuatly graduated from there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in Gunnison that Joseph first met Roxie Bartholomew of Fayette and later they both attended Snow Academy at Ephraim and the Gunnison Seminary at the same time. They became very interested in each other. Roxie, together with her younger sister Sarah, also attended B. Y. A. at Provo the winter of 1890/91. It was here that Joseph’s and Roxie’s courtship flourished andi blossomed, almost within the shadow of beautiful Mt, Timpanogos. Roxie was an efficient little dark-haired, round-faced miss of English descent, while Joseph was a bit-over-six-feet tall, blond, curly headed youth of full-blooded Danish extraction. Now today it is fashionable to be descended from the early Vikings, but in those college days the greatest insult one could give a fellow was to call him “a great big Dane” or “a great big overgrown Swede”, or so we have been told. Nevertheless, Roxie fell in love with Joseph, Danish heritage and all, and the two were married Sept. 6, 1893 in the Manti Temple. This was the first of three marriages between the Christensens and the Fayette Bartholomews. Later, Roxie’s younger sister, Sarah, married Joseph’s older brother Andrew, and still later the girls’ younger brother Alma married the boys’ oldest sister, Elsie.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following Joseph’s graduation. from, B. Y. A. (later B. Y. U.) he first taught school in Centerfield, but lived in Gunnison near by. Here he rented two rooms in the Bardsley home, corner of <span id="page-518"></span> First North and Second West. This home is still standing (1968) but now unoccupied and dilapidated. It was here that their first child Harold was born, 21 Oct. 1894. Likely Joseph’s mother Else, who lived close by, assisted as midwife at that birth. Roxie always had a hard time having her babies. She had two more little ones while they were then living in Gunnison. The first of these, little Roxie Irene, lived only six weeks (6 Nov. 1896-18 Dec. 1896) and the second, Royal Milton, a month and eleven days (14 Jan. 1898-25 Feb. 1898) (There is some confusion now among various members of the family as to the exact dates of these two births and deaths - more research should be done.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph’s next teaching assignment, following the births and deaths of these two babies, was in Redmond. Harold wrote of this in his history:— “My first recollections, as a real small child of about five years, were in Redmond, Utah, a very small town in Sevier County about ten miles south of Gunnison, where both my father and mother taught school. I remember trying to keep up with the older boys of the neighborhood while playing ‘Follow-Jack’ and trying to jump a wide ditch, as they did. I would get wet and then would get my legs whipped with my wet stockings that had buttons on the top, and that didn’t feel so good.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The next winter the folks went over to Vernal, Utah in the Uinta Basin to teach. They loaded our belongings in a large buggy and we started out by way of Salina Canyon. I don’t remember how many nights we camped out but the morning after the first one, father was sure someone had come in the night and turned our buggy around. Of course it wasn’t the buggy but father that was turned around, but he wouldn’t admit that he was wrong. He made me a ‘flipper’ while on that trip. After two years of teaching in Vernal we went back to Gunnison to stay and father became principal of the public school there.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another baby was born to Joseph and Roxie that first winter back in Gunnison. But little La Faun, born 27 Feb. 1901, only lived two and a half months and then passed away, 13 May 1901. Thus they had lost three little ones straight in a</p>

  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-519"></span> row and all were laid to rest in the Gunnison Cemetery. Though infant mortality was much higher in those early days than it is today, still this must have been most disheartening to this couple and they must have begun to wonder if they would ever have another child to raise besides Harold.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph soon had their first very-own home built in Gunnison and they were able to move in sometime before their fifth child and second daughter, Ruth Ellen, was born, 7 Oct. 1902. (Details of her birth appear in another chapter.) Harold remembered well when that house was being built. They were then living part of the time in Fayette with his Bartholomew grandparents, but he used to come in from there and play about, jumping and sometimes stumbling over the rubber hoses with which the workmen were watering down the cement and, as he said, “getting into mischief in general”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This house is still standing in Gunnison (1969) and from the outside appearance, still in good condition though changed some. How well I remember going there with my parents as a youngster, or again with father on his way past there to our Gunnison Ranch. Uncle Joseph and Aunt Roxie had lots of cows, horses, pigs, chickens and even turkeys on their place and plenty of milk, cream and eggs for any use. There were heaps of corn on the cob and fresh tomatoes in season, for they always had the best of vegetable gardens, and there was often chicken soup with dumplings, made the Danish way. Aunt Roxie was a splendid cook and so friendly and “chatty”. Uncle Joseph, if he were home, was usually sitting in a big chair reading. He seemed to me to be a man of few words, but when he spoke it was with wisdom and deliberation. My younger sister, Cousin Ruth Ellen’s age, thought him overly stern for he sometimes got after them for making too much noise, or doing this or that. But then, perhaps Ruth Ellen and Ellen Elaine needed a little “telling” on occasions. My, how they used to pound on that piano!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though Joseph may have seemed stern to some at times, because of his sober and deliberate way of speaking, yet he was by habit most loving <span id="page-520"></span> and kind, not only to his family, friends and associates but to the less fortunate as well. His son Virgil remembers their mother Roxie telling about how good their father always was to the many Indians that came through Gunnison begging in those early days. He never turned them down but always gave them flour, meat, fruit, potatoes, or anything else he had on hand. He was also very generous and considerate of the Japanese people who often worked for him on his farm west of Gunnison, raising sugar beets, etc. He built them a farm house on his land by Rocky Point, in which to live.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Beneath Joseph’s somber surface bubbled an ever-ready “dry wit”, much like his father’s. Virgil tells a story that is typical of this:— “Joseph went down town to a movie one night in Gunnison and slept through the whole show. When he came out he asked the manager, Mr. Duggins, for his money back. Duggins of course wanted to know the reason and Joseph said, ‘If a show isn’t good enough to keep a fellow awake it isn’t worth the money.’”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph never neglected his church duties. The early Gunnison Ward records show that he was born 7 Mar. 1871; blessed 6 Apr. 1871 by Jens Jensen; bapt. 25 July 1880 by Thomas Williams and confirmed the same day by F. W. Blom; ordained a Deacon, then a Teacher and finally a Priest in the Aaronic priesthood, the latter being 7 Jan. 1893. Other L. D. S. church records indicate that Joseph was ordained an Elder in the Melchizedek priesthood 3 Sept. 1893 by James Jensen; ordained a Seventy 21 Nov. 1893 by Brigham H. Roberts, and on 10 Aug. 1902 he was ordained to the office of High Priest by George Teasdale. The same day he was set apart as Second Counselor to Bishop A. C. Madsen in the Gunnison Ward bishopric. In 1903 he was ordained a Bishop and set apart to preside over the Gunnison Ward as its fifth bishop, This calling he filled well for nine years. Later he became a member of the Gunnison Stake High Council and also an active member of Gunnison Stake High Priests quorum, and was serving as that organization’s class leader <span id="page-521"></span> at the time of his death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph Christensen (son) was also very | prominent in the civic affairs of both Gunnison and Gunnison Valley. He served as Gunnison’s Mayor, or Town President as it was then called, for two terms of two years each. It was during his tenure of office, Sept. 1909, that Gunnison obtained the franchise making it a third class city. About the same time the Gunnison water system was created. In December that year a law was passed limiting the tax allowed in the area to the valuation of the property. In March 1910, also while Joseph was Mayor, the electric power company brought lights to Gunnison. His was a productive administration.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some of Joseph’s other public services included being secretary to the Board of Directors of the Gunnison Valley Bank; secretary for the South Sanpete District School Board; secretary of the Gunnison Telephone Company; a member of the Board of Sanpete County Commissioners; president of the Sanpete-Sevier Beet Growers Association; and head of the Gunnison Valley Swine Breeders Association. Indeed he held many public positions of trust during his lifetime, for he was a worker and he loved to serve.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph owned a fine farm east of Gunnison. He had a nice three-room house with a front porch built on this farm to house an occasional overseer or laborer and his family. In fact we understand it was first built for a Danish emigrant cousin of his father’s, her husband and two daughters, when said husband, Niels Jensen, was given employment there by Joseph. Harold eventually took over this farm and told about it in his history:— “Before being married I had worked with father on the farm during school and in summers. After Herma and I were married we first lived in town, but moved to the farm Jan. 1919 when our first baby, Cloyd, was six months old. We raised sugar beets, sheep and cattle.” Today that east farm is still in the Christensen family, being owned by Harold’s son, Keller, and now one of the finest cattle farms in the area. But Joseph owned and developed other farming land around Gunnison Valley and, according to his son Myron, it was one of his greatest <span id="page-522"></span> ambitions to be able to give to each of his sons, in turn, a productive, well-stocked farm of his own, as he had done Harold.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However, Joseph’s main work during the better part of his lifetime was school work, and how he loved it. He was in the classroom, either as a student or a teacher, for forty-five years. During that time he studied much of the time to keep abreast of things. It has been said that one seldom saw him sit down without a book in his hands. Truly, he was a great reader, student and teacher as well, for from his early youth it had been one of his great ambitions to achieve a high standing in the educational world, and to this he had devoted much of his time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He gave up the classroom sometime near the period that ended the First World War. He had decided to go forward in the direction of another ambition, that of developing and stocking his other farms with a view to getting them in order for his boys yet in the home. This done, he undoubtedly planned to settle down to some of his own personal projects and begin to realize his dreams for himself and Roxie. There was a great feeling of speculation in the air then. People were venturing financially on all sides. War prices were still on and things looked rosy ahead. Joseph decided to feed lambs on quite a scale for the then excellent market. He borrowed thousands of dollars to buy them. He also invested in some hogs, in hopes of benefiting there also. Harold said that his father figured that if he were successful in this venture he could retire from his labors by the time he was fifty-five and then spend his time doing the things he himself longed to do.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Joseph never realized this ambition for the bottom fell out of everything and the market crashed. Instead he lost heavily. This was a great blow to him from which he never quite recovered. Nevertheless, he turned over his much-loved home and some other property to his creditors and moved his family to the “Rocky Point” farm house he had earlier built for some Japanese. Roxie made it as comfortable as possible, Here they continued feeding a few sheep <span id="page-523"></span> and hogs, as well as a flock of chickens, in hopes of making some sort of a “come-back”. Joseph engaged in a number of projects, one of which was organizing a Swine Breeders Association to help step up the quality and price of hogs. Indeed he did all he could to get things going for them again - but he was terribly discouraged.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The youngest son, Don, who was then about five and unaware of the real situation, tells something about this period in his own history, as follows:— “At the time of my birth the family was residing within the Gunnison City limits but my recollections of the home there are vague. My first clear recollection of home is of the farm house down below Rocky Point, a mile or so west of Gunnison. Of this place I have many fond memories: - father working in the garden, helping mother with the chickens and around the house; me exploring the hills in the neighborhood, riding horseback, playing in the sand dunes and helping on the farm. I remember helping with the pigs, Chester Whites they were, and when the creek of water just above our homestead would start to dry up and water was no longer running in the Sanpitch River below, it was my job to salvage and carry enough water from the creek to keep the hogs relatively content. I have a vivid recollection of those hot summer days - the buckets that seemed always too large - and the thirsty livestock.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marvin well remembers helping his father feed lambs there at Rocky Point, both before and after this ill-fated venture. He said what his father lost was not a staggering amount when compared with the money available today, but then in those hard-to-get-money days, thousands of dollars was a fortune when you lost it and enough to change the course of all their lives. He himself was in his later teens at the time and had been working hard at the project, with his father, and looking forward to owning a farm of his own. This failure was hard on the young as well as the old.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Life went on at Rocky Point nevertheless and the experience drew the family closer together. This is not to say that there were never any little family squabbles, however, Virgil tells a story <span id="page-524"></span> his mother used to tell of those days which might be called, “There’s more than one way to skin a cat”. She and Joseph had decided that they should have some trees on their place there at Rocky Point, but for the life of them they couldn’t agree on where to plant them. Finally Joseph just went ahead and planted some where he wanted them and Roxie let him go ahead and do it and said no more about the affair. But then she went outside after that for a little while each day, when Joseph wasn’t around, and gave each of the newly planted trees a real good shove. Roxie always ended this story by saying, “… And do you know - not one of those trees ever grew!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We passed that place near Rocky Point the summer of 1967. There were no trees standing there and in fact not the slightest indication that even a house had ever stood there. It was a dry and barren place. Harold was with us and pointed out the spot where his folks had lived some forty years or so ago - but only rocks and dirt were there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph grew more quiet as the days went by and also somewhat listless. It was evident that he was not entirely well; yet he kept plugging along and complained little, if at all. Then, about the forepart of July 1926 he came down with an extreme, though then undetermined, illness which took him to his bed right away. He seemed to know then that he was nearing his end. Roxie must have realized it too. She said that in this last illness Joseph’s mind was so clear that he could figure out the answers to problems that had perplexed him for years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As his daughter Ruth Ellen sat by his bedside grieving one day, he told her that death was like waking on a warm morning in June - and he did so dislike winter! And when he was very, very ill and close to death and his brother Andrew stood beside his bed, he told him that he had been close enough to death, in that last illness, to know what was coming; and he likened death unto “meeting a morning star”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joseph died in the farmhouse near Rocky Point, 23 July 1926. Strange to say, he was exactly</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-525"></span> fifty-five years four months and sixteen days old when he finally retired from his life’s labors. Some said he died of a broken heart, but Myron said it was thought to have been a bursted stomach ulcer followed by a number of complications and ending with pneumonia. He was buried in the Gunnison City Cemetery 25 July 1926.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His funeral, held on the above date, was well attended by people from all walks of life. Many had been his students or co-workers. Here, among the many other tributes, were read two sets of resolutions of respect, one from the officials of Sanpete County and the other from the High Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake. We quote them in that order:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Whereas, there has been lost to Sanpete County one of the members of the Board of County Commissioners who has devoted not only his labor and his energy but also his mind and heart to the doing of tasks imposed on him and voluntarily assumed by him; Whereas, the nature and character of the services rendered by Joseph Christensen to the public in the many capacities in which he has served were such as to reflect credit on the entire community and be a splendid example for all employees to admire; be it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">—Resolved: that we, the officials of Sanpete County, desire to express officially our admiration for Joseph Christensen, as a man and as a public servant; and as a token of our respect and esteem, that a copy of this resolution be spread upon the records of Sanpete County and that a copy be presented to his family. Be it further Resolved, that we offer our sincerest condolence to Mr. Christensen’s family in this hour of their bereavement.” (Respectfully submitted, dated and signed, by Geo. E. Cook, Chairman. }</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Whereas, in the wisdom of our Heavenly Father, our Brother and class leader, Joseph Christensen, has been called from this sphere of action and advanced to a higher sphere where his splendid talents and powers will not be limited; and Whereas, his departure has left a vacant place in the High Priests Quorum which will be hard to <span id="page-526"></span> fill; therefore be it Resolved: that we tender to the bereaved family of our departed member our heartfelt sympathy and call their attention to the great work their father is now beginning, the union on the other side and the welcome he will receive from relatives and friends who have gone before; and be it further Resolved: that a copy of these resolutions be given to the sorrowing family, and also that they be placed upon the records of the High Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among the numerous characteristics and qualities Joseph had inherited from his predecessors was a quiet, dignified and deliberate mien from his father, as well as a handsome head of curly hair, and a great thirst for knowledge, both secular and religious, from his mother. He was a great theologian as well as scholar and he used his wisdom and knowledge for the benefit of others. He was a tall man. He left the world five tall sons, each as tall or taller than he, and one lovely daughter who has been a great comfort to all of them over the years - and he left a wise and loving wife and mother to his children, as well as to other children wherever she was privileged to serve.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His daughter Ruth, in writing of her father, says: “I feel that father’s life can be best summed up in these words taken from an editorial which appeared in the local newspaper soon after his death.” Thus we conclude his history by quoting that editorial supplied by Ruth:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the death of Joseph Christensen last week, Sanpete County, the Gunnison Valley and Gunnison lost one of their real substantial and progressive citizens. And these citizens - men, women and children - bowed their heads in sorrow and mourned his death, deeply and sincerely. His broad mind, his liberal thoughts, his goodness, endeared him to all who knew him and he was held in the highest esteem by thousands of warm friends and admirers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In his public life he proved efficient, honest, and was trusted. He occupied offices of trust and was placed there for his integrity, efficiency and honesty; and never once was the finger of criticism pointed at him. Joseph Christensen was a scholar <span id="page-527"></span> and a student. He had one aim, to reach the highest pinnacle, and his life was taken just as he was prepared to start his real life’s work. He was loved and he loved all, whether Mormon, Jew or Gentile.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“A cloud of sorrow in the calling of this good and friendly citizen will hang heavily and thousands of friends will forever cherish his memory.”</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">Roxie Ellen Bartholomew (Christensen) wife of Joseph, born 30 Mar. 1872 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah, the daughter of John and Eliza Roxie Metcalf Bartholomew. We are fortunate to have had the following history of her submitted by her sister-in-law, Catherine Decker (Mrs. Henry L.) Bartholomew; she titles it “Aunt Roxie” … “This is the name she had for the last twenty years of her life; people really didn’t know her by any other name, especially the youngsters of Fayette and Gunnison. The school teachers who came to Fayette still speak of her as Aunt Roxie. Her own brothers and sisters speak of her as Aunt Roxie. Her world was made up of nieces and nephews, both old and young.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“She was born in the log house where her parents lived the first few years after their marriage - she was their second child and oldest daughter. She could remember her father building the new rock house. They moved into it before it was finished so that her younger sister Sarah could be born there. Gradually their new house was finished - the parlor being completed last. The carpet they put on the parlor floor was hand-woven. Roxie’s grandmother Bartholomew (Polly Benson) helped her mother Eliza wash, card, spin, dye and weave the wool of which it was made. This parlor was a very special room, entered only on Sundays when the members of the family were dressed in their best and clean from their Saturday night baths. It was here that her father read the scriptures; here that they knelt in family prayers on the straw padded carpet - that was luxury! This room was heated by a fireplace which is still in the room at the present (1968). <span id="page-528"></span> The woodwork about the side and the mantle are the same that her father John made some ninety years ago.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie remembered their first great family tragedy. It was the latter part of October 1878 - she was six and a half. Her oldest brother, John, nearly nine was very sick with ‘membranous croup’. Elder John Mellor was called to the home to administer to and bless the child. He gave John the blessing of health, but as he turned to leave he said to her mother: ‘Eliza, I can’t tell you that William will live.’ He had reference to Roxie’s young brother, age four, who was sitting on the floor playing and apparently in the best of health. John recovered but in two days William was dead. Roxie remembered their sorrow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Roxie was about eight years old her mother was making apricot jam and asked her to see if it was cool. She tried to lift the large pan and upset it, spilling the hot jam all over herself from her neck down to her legs. She was badly burned and it took a long time to heal the resulting sores.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Eleven children were born to that Bartholomew family and Roxie helped her mother as any pioneer daughter should. She was about twelve years old when her mother got a ‘home’ sewing machine. Eliza wasn’t used to this quick way of hemming sheets so she put Roxie to it. Though her mother tried to show her how, Roxie did it her own way, behind her mother’s back, and soon learned all the tricks of cutting and sewing and her mother knew she was the better of the two, child though she was.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Her father was Presiding Elder and then Bishop of Fayette for many years (about forty-seven in all). For some time the end of the railroad was at the Juab terminal of York, some fifteen miles north of Fayette. When the authorities of the church had conference appointments south of Juab, they would put their horses and carriages on the train, unload them at York and drive to Bishop Bartholomew’s to spend the night, or at least rest their animals for a time in his big barn that always <span id="page-529"></span> seemed to have hay enough and to spare.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Apostle Wilford Woodruff was a favorite in the Bartholomew home, especially with the children. He was asleep upstairs at their place when, in July of 1887, a rider came from York on horseback, trying to find Apostle Woodruff to tell him to come back to Salt Lake because President Taylor had passed away. (Wilford Woodruff was then President of the Quorum of the Twelve and twenty-one months later, April 1889, he was elevated to the presidency of the church.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie remembered hearing of her grandparents being at the meeting in Nauvoo when the mantle of Joseph Smith fell on Brigham Young. Her grandpa had said, ‘It is the Prophet. - it looks like him - it sound like him!’ He had left his seat in the Bowery where the conference was being held, 8 Aug. 1844, and gone around front to the speakers’ stand. He came back and said to his wife, with great conviction, ‘We will follow Brigham Young to the ends of the earth!’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At one time Roxie’s mother had a terrible abcess on her neck. She had a houseful of company from Salt Lake and the visiting Elders gave her a blessing. Next morning, after the Elders were fed and on their way south to their assignment, Eliza thought of her neck. The pain was gone and healing had started.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie met Joseph Christensen in Gunnison. They both went to the Snow Academy at Ephraim at the same time and then attended the Gunnison Seminary, where she was appointed Girls’ Matron. They attended Brigham Young Academy at Provo the same time also and here is where their courtship took a serious turn. They were married 6 Sept. 1893 in the Manti Temple, the first marriage among the children of both families. Later, as we have been told before, two others of the Bartholomews married two other Christensens. Roxie and Joseph’s was a very happy marriage. Nine children were born to this union. Three died in infancy and were buried in the Gunnison City Cemetery.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Ruth Ellen was Roxie’s and Joseph’s fifth child and the first following the three little ones <span id="page-530"></span> who died, one right after the other a few weeks after their births. Her grandmother Christensen was in attendance at her birth, the dramatic story of which has been given in an earlier part of this book. Ruth was always very dear to her parents, as she has always been to her various brothers and their families.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the early years after her marriage, Roxie always went back to her childhood home in Fayette at Christmastime to make things happy there. She was a jolly sort of person and such excellent company. She always had some joke or ‘Christmas treat’, especially made for her brothers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie loved to sew. She made everything - children clothes, fancy dresses, suits, coats, sweaters, wedding dresses, boys pants, and numerous sets of burial clothes. She did most of her mother-in-law Else’s sewing and that for Vena and Tresia until they left the Christensen home. She kept Ruth Ellen looking like a little princess. She was a master at ‘making things over’. (In fact, as Ruth Ellen said, “She was a wonderful seamstress”).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie fed her big family the very best of food. Joseph and their oldest son, Harold, used to kill as high as fifty wild ducks in one hunt and for the season they would supply a set number every day to a Salt Lake market; killing, cleaning and dressing them and putting a specified number on the north-going train each day. Joseph and Roxie cleaned the ducks and as they were busy cleaning, a cake made in a big black dripper-pan by Roxie could easily walk out of the house, a piece at a time, in the hands of her five hungry boys. She always had room in her house, at her table and in her heart for ‘one more’ even if that one happened to be ‘ten’. Alma Fredrickson, a boy about Harold’s age who needed a home, lived at their home for nine years and became almost like a son to them and a brother to Harold.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Following the death of her husband, Joseph, 23 July 1926, Roxie continued to live in their home just west of Rocky Point with her four unmarried sons. Myron was married the next spring, 13 Apr. <span id="page-531"></span> 1927, and then there were just the three boys left; Virgil 18, Marvin 15½, and Don 10. In early November of 1928 Roxie went to Fayette to help her brother Henry put up his fruit, his wife Ireta having passed away late that summer leaving him alone with three small sons to care for; Homer 7, Keith 5 and John 3½. She never went back to Rocky Point to live long. Soon she began to bring her chickens and barnyard animals and her household goods back to the old homestead and the Old Rock House she had watched and helped her father build in her childhood. She moved in with her brother Henry and his boys, who then occupied the old place.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don tells something of this move:— “Sometime after father’s death we moved from our Rocky Point home to Fayette, Utah, a distance of about six miles. Uncle Henry had lost his wife and been left with three young sons. He invited mother and her family to come and live with him, they being brother and sister, and she accepted. I recall that my job in the moving was to take a horse and drive our milch cow, ‘Old Jerse’, to our new home. To me at the time it seemed a great adventure and undertaking to set forth alone below the foothills of Fayette.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The arrangement to combine families worked out with little friction and with great benefit to all concerned. Mother soon became ‘Aunt Roxie’ to her nephews, as well as all the other children in town; and Uncle Henry, with his gentleness and patience, became a second father to me.” Ruth Ellen adds:— “Mother took her three youngest boys and went to help Uncle Henry raise his three motherless sons. She stayed with him twenty years; it was the most beautiful brother-sister relationship I have ever seen. She became ‘Aunt Roxie’ to everyone in Fayette - she had so much love to give!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Catherine continues her history:— “Roxie made many people happy with presents of Danish dumplings, Danish meatballs or Danish sweet-soup, which she undoubtedly learned to make from her Danish mother-in-law, Else. She could cook mutton to a ‘queen’s taste’. Many of her friends would say, ‘We don’t like mutton’, but after a meal <span id="page-532"></span> at her table these very ones would say, ‘What delicious meat - what is it?’ It was mutton.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“She made her own yeast and bread - cakes, pies, butter, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese and head cheese. She made sausage and cured hams and bacon. Always she had a garden of wonderful flowers and vegetables. She would have cantaloupe enough from her garden each fall for a Fayette ‘town treat.’” Ruth Ellen adds to this:— “Always her hands were busy. Her hoe was her cane - no weeds could show their heads in her large garden and live.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Catherine continues:— “She always had chickens to supply eggs, chicken for Sunday dinners and ‘egg money’. She stuffed them for roasting with bread and sage dressing. She raised turkeys, ducks and geese. She kept her youngest son, Don, on his mission with her ‘egg money’. She was always on the giving end of life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Roxie was a wonderful mother to Henry’s three boys, as well as her own. It was a sad experience for her when Henry’s middle boy, Keith, died after two operations (1937). He had always been so kind and courteous to her. She had been in Henry’s home some thirteen years when he was married to his second wife, Catherine Decker. She stayed on seven more years to help mother two more of Henry’s sons by this second marriage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In October 1948 she moved back to Gunnison and went to live with her oldest son, Harold, and his second wife, Stella. Henry and Catherine moved from Fayette back to Gunnison, 3 June 1949. One room in their new home was designated as ‘Aunt Roxie’s room’, but she never came back to live in it. She died in Gunnison Hospital 5 Jan. 1952 and was buried beside her husband and three infant children in the Gunnison Cemetery. Apostle James E. Talmage once said, ‘All you can hold in your cold, dead hands is what you have given away’. If this be so, then Roxie’s hands were full enough to last for eternities.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aunt Roxie was indeed a good woman. For most of the later part of her almost eighty years she suffered from crippling arthritis, yet she kept <span id="page-533"></span> cheerful and seldom complained, never gave up, neither did she let this painful affliction keep her from her services of love. She was active in each of the auxiliary organizations of the church in one way or another, from time to time, besides filling the demanding service as the wife of a busy Bishop and life-long public servant. By far her greatest role, however, must certainly have been that of an understanding, loving mother and kind friend, not only to her own children but to all who came her way in need of tender care and affection.</p>
