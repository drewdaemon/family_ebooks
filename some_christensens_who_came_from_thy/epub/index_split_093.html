  <p class="calibre1">Ellamae also writes other details of her  life:- “While we lived in Goshen my brother A. Owen married ‘Pate’, who has always been like a sister to me. Aunt Vena and cousin Pearl also moved there. I remember Grandma Christensen visiting us and making a braided rug for Mother. I rode by bus to high school in Payson where I graduated in May 1930. That fall I enrolled at Henager Business  College in Salt Lake City and attended nine months. While there I was typist for a school paper, ‘The Dynamo’, and won three awards, one in penmanship and two in shorthand. I also headed the typing list with 97 words a minute and three errors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“While at home in Payson next winter, 1931/32, Byron and I went to Nephi to learn the MIA contest dance, a tango. I also started violin lessons with Tresia Krauss but only took a few. I took part in the MIA road show and was in the MIA ladies’ chorus contest. Iwas hired to take in shorthand and transcribe the funeral services of John Perkins. On the 8 Mar. 1932, I returned to Salt Lake City to work in the office at Henager’s and to continue business school, <span id="page-876"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My first full time job ($40.00 a month) was with Utah-California Motor Lines in Salt Lake, where I met my future husband, Harold Dorcheus Krantz (b. 1 Feb. 1910 in Culdesac, Idaho (near Ashton) to William Charles and Ellen Louise Dorcheus Krantz). I called him ‘Pat’ and he was tall, dark and handsome. At the time I lived with Aunt Sarah Christensen, my father’s sister, and she was like a second mother to me. During this time Cousin Lucile and I became good pals. We gave each other nicknames, I called her ‘Sally’ - she called me ‘Jerry’. Hers didn’t stick but I’ve been Jerry ever since.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I worked for two years, then Pat and I were married at my parents’ home in Payson, by Bishop Cheever, 16 Dec, 1933. We lived in Salt Lake for our first two years, during which time our first son, Bill, was born. Looking at him for the first time I felt that we had performed a miracle. He was an exceptionally good baby and I spent most of my time playing with him, since Pat was driving interstate  so wasn’t home very much. I wrote him a letter each time he left home so he would get it when he arrived at his destination.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then we moved to Maywood, California, where Pat started working for an oil company. Our son Mike was born in Bell, California. We enjoyed our nine years in California and saw many interesting places. It was like a dream seeing the ocean for the first time; the boys loved to play on the beach. While we were there, Edith, Heber and family moved down to California, and also Cliff and Rhea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“To me, owning a home has always meant security so I started working at Consolidated Steel in Maywood to help get a down payment for one. We bought a home in Whittier, Calif., in an orange grove. I shall never forget the smell of orange blossoms and night-blooming jasmine, nor the plaintive song of the nightingale. Then came the shock of Pearl Harbor and the blackouts. It was especially tense on the coast. Consolidated Steel built tank lighters, anti-aircraft guns and Liberty ships. (We saw one of these launched). We decided to sell our home and move back to Utah or Idaho. <span id="page-877"></span> So in the spring of 1943 we bought a home in Idaho Falls,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It seemed wonderful to see the streets lighted again - I felt so good I wanted to run instead of walk. We found the people so friendly and interested, The boys and I became active in the Fifth Ward. I taught Primary and was secretary  in the Relief Society. I also served as Stake Secretary for the Relief Societ. Pat joined in the socials and dances. Then we bought a small farm and moved six miles out of town. Pat and I were both inexperienced but worked hard fixing up the house and getting livestock and machinery. The house was modern only to the extent that it had water piped in. Later we found out that the well went dry every spring for three months. We painted, papered, built new cupboards and installed hot water. Pat was working as a car salesman and I decided to go to work to help with the finances. We had a big garden so there was plenty of canning to do. We had cows, pigs, chickens, rabbits, and raised hay, grain and potatoes. We studied all the government bulletins on farming. I could write a book on our experiences on that farm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The boys had a mare and colt. They rode the school bus to school and were active in all kinds of sports and in music. Bill played the violin and Mike sang and played the piano. Many times in the winter the roads would be closed from drifting snow. We made a comfortable home the nine years we lived on the farm and have many happy  memories - the boys loved it!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We had an outstanding Bishop in the Taylor Ward, Wesley Roberts, who had a wonderful influence on our boys. I’m sure it was his teachings  and inspiration that gave them the desire to go on missions. We have always been proud of our boys and wonder sometimes how we could have been so lucky. They both filled missions, Bill in Mexico and Mike in the New Engiand States. They both graduated from college, Bill from the University of Idaho in Forestry and Mike from the BYU in Business Administration. They both had temple marriages. Bill married Helen Sessions in the Idaho Falls Temple and Mike married Judith Ann <span id="page-878"></span> Eastwood, whom he met at BYU, in the Los Angeles Temple. As I write this history and reflect on my life up to the present I am amazed how time flies. It seems only yesterday our boys were small. I look at them now with their little families and think - ‘there we were a few years ago’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“After the boys left home we sold the farm and moved back to town. My husband works as a driver-salesman for Challenge Creamery. I have been working for the past some twenty years as legal secretary for the firm Holden, Holden &amp; Kidwell. I have blue eyes, light brown hair, am five feet four inches tall and weigh 120-125 lbs., which doesn’t vary much. I love being home, like housework, and am happy in the kitchen. I get compliments on my cooking. I’ve always tried to create a homey atmosphere so my family will love coming home and will remember it with pleasure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I love to read and listen to sweet music - but  also like activities such as dancing, hiking, swimming and bicycle riding. I can completely lose myself in gardening and it is pure joy for me to be out in the hills fishing in a lively stream or beautiful Lake Palisades. I love simple things like the coziness of a fireside, the smell of clothes just taken from the line, or of freshly baked bread. I love the smell of willows on the river, lilacs in bloom, and blue sky with billowy clouds. I especially  like being grandma and shopping for the grandchildren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I love to take trips and see new country. When the boys were young we took them on a camping trip to Glacier National Park. After we got our trailer we took Bill and Helen to Priest Lake in northern Idaho and Mike and Judy through Yellowstone Park. Pat and I have traveled through all the western states, including a ferryboat ride through the San Juan Islands to Victoria, and to Mexico when Bill was released from his mission. A Christmas or two ago we flew to Moscow, Idaho, to be with Mike and his family and later we flew back to Maryland to see Bill and his.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Now here we are still in Idaho Falis, where <span id="page-879"></span> we own a nice home, a car, truck and house trailer parked on the river in Swan Valley where we spend weekends all summer. My husband shares his great love of the outdoors with me. We fish, hike, pick chokecherries and huckleberries, read or just relax and enjoy the sound of the river. In the winters we enjoy our cozy fireside and try to accomplish special projects. We finished a hooked rug last year and have an afghan to crochet now. Pat keeps the house repaired and painted. There are many things I would like to do. I would like to learn to play the piano well and to sew my own clothes. I’ve always thought I would like  nursing - perhaps when I retire I’ll do hospital work. Perhaps someday also Pat and I can give our boys their dearest wish and go through the temple.”</p>
