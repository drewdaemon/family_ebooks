  <p class="calibre1">(34) Grace Christensen, twin (8) calls her history “My Memories.” Although many of her memories have been quoted in earlier pages of this book, some have been repeated here:- “Three of the six children of Millie and Arthur Christensen were born in the ‘rock house’ in West Gunnison. This house, as I remember, was a square structure with an upstairs and balcony. The water we used was taken from a well at the back door. For light we used kerosine lamps. In fact, Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me. I heard the grown-ups talk and joke so much about this that I actually thought I had seen it and heard the bang.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My parents were proud and happy with their <span id="page-820"></span> enlarged family - four children under the age of four. Then too, the way things happened was quite the talk around town. I was born about twenty minutes before midnight on Feb. 16, 1909 and Gladys was born about twenty minutes after midnight on Feb. 17, 1909. Twins born on different days. Our family moved to a ranch at Upton, Utah, when the two of us were going on three (1911). Gladys seemed to be the constant concern of everyone there. She got into so much trouble. I was in on some of it too.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Both Melrose and Wesley started school at Upton. They rode horses; we all did - the four kids on one horse at times. Melrose was reliable and was the ‘boss’ when Mother and Dad were away. I remember the wonderful music of my Mother and Father. Their voices blended so beautifully. Mother played the guitar and Dad the mandolin. At this time I thought there was nothing so heavenly. Many times we were lulled to sleep by their songs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We moved back to Gunnison into the house Father had bought from our Uncle Chris. Mother really had her hands full trying to get Gladys and me ready for our first day at school. Everything was home-made - even our bloomers and our hand knit stockings. I recall so well the old rain barrel just outside the door. This soft rainwater was used for washing our long hair.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“That late fall we moved into the handsome red-brick house Father bought from Aunt Elsie. This was wonderful - pavement all over, up to the barn, around the house - everywhere. We raced around in our little wagons. It was shortly after this that Father and Mother decided to go into the grocery business and politics. Dad was persuaded by friends to run for Mayor of Gunnison. He lost the race by two votes. Actually, he was relieved to have lost; his heart wasn’t in it - nor the grocery store either. He longed to be outside with the animals and soil. So he rented a farm west of Gunnison and we moved there. Melrose, Wesley, Gladys and I were old enough to help on the farm. We worked hard with the sugar beets, hay, grain, etc., for a year or two. Then we moved back to the red-brick home. <span id="page-821"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At Christmas time, when Gladys and I were sophomores in Gunnison High School, we moved to Manti to run and operate the Eagle House Hotel. Gladys and I graduated from Manti High School and then rode the bus one year to attend Snow College in Ephraim, some miles to the north. Gladys was offered a job, and accepted, to teach group piano to school children in South Sanpete School District. I finished my second year at Snow and received a teacher’s certificate.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I taught two years at Mt. Emmons in Duchesne Co., Utah. The following summer I met Douglas Larsen, a registered professional engineer and surveyor. From then on I decided to work nearby, so taught fifth grade at Gunnison for one-and-a-half years. Father was then ranching at Trout Creek and it was here his health began to fail. He died in the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City 2 Dec. 1932 at age fifty, of a ruptured gall bladder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Douglas and I were married a month later, 3 Jan. 1933, at Richfield, Utah. (Douglas Forrester Larsen b. 6 Aug. 1899, Salt Lake City, Utah to John and Louise Larsen Larsen). Doug’s work as an engineer took us to several places in our early married years - Parowan, Beaver, Vernal, Price, three years in Richfield, etc. In 1941 we moved to Salt Lake City where Doug was District Engineer for the State Highway Dept. and later Chief  Construction and Materials engineer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“By this time Mother had moved to a big house in Salt Lake City and we moved in with her. David and Max were still at home and Gladys also lived with Mother until 1942 when she moved to California. Our daughter, Sydney, was born while we were living here, in 1943. When she was six months old we bought a home on Hollywood Ave. and lived there about two years.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the meantime Mother married Octav Gudmundson and was working at Auerbach’s. We moved back with her and ‘Goodie’. In those days the children were coming and going; it wasn’t unusual to cook and do for fifteen people at once. Then in Aug. 1950 Doug and I bought our present <span id="page-822"></span> home on Emerson Ave, and moved into that.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sydney was then in school, so I decided to go back to my profession of teaching. I have been at Highland Park Elementary School for nearly sixteen years. I graduated from the University of Utah cum laude in 1965. A year later Sydney received her BS degree from the U of U in recreational  therapy. She has been working as a therapist with special children at the Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City since then and is working on her Masters degree.”</p>
