  <p class="calibre1">(52) Charlotte Rose Christensen (7) writes something of herself:- “I was born 30 Apr. 1917 in Lyman, Uinta, Wyoming, eighth child in the family. I attended school at Evanston, Cheyenne and Lyman, Wyoming, graduating from Lyman High School as class valedictorian with a scholarship to the University of Wyoming at Laramie.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I spent from Sep. 1934 through June 1937 at the University of Wyoming. I worked my way through doing stenographic duties and being pianist of the campus dance band. In July 1937 I accepted a position with the fiscal agent of the university but continued in campus activities, including the dance band, until 23 May 1939. June 1, 1939 I accepted a summer position with the Department of Interior at Yellowstone National Park but stayed summer and winter for two-and-a-half years. War was declared and I resigned to go to California, 13 Jan. 1942, at which time I was secretary to the assistant to the superintendent of the department at Yellowstone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“From 27 Mar. 1942 to 8 June 1951 I worked at secretarial duties with the Air Traffic Control Division of the Civil Aeronautics Administration in Santa Monica and Los Angeles, California. My last position with this group was as secretary to the Chief of the Air Traffic Control Branch, with supervision over the stenographic staff. I resigned due to pregnancy, for in the meantime I had married, 8 Aug. 1948 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Herbert James Warne (b. 2 Oct. 1920 in Erie, Pa., to Earl Ross and Julie Marie Semple Warne).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He had his own dance band and we had met through his need for a piano player. He played the trumpet. He was attending UCLA under the GI bill at the time and he graduated in Business Administration from the University in June of 1950. He now works for Max Factor as a purchasing agent and has for the last twelve years and more. His favorite hobby is his 17 ft. inboard-outboard motor boat and the fishing and water skiing, etc. it provides.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Our three daughters are our greatest blessings of all. They are talented in music, dancing, <span id="page-898"></span> scholarship, looks and personality - guess you can tell I’m proud of our children! They are one hundred percenters in church attendance, all baptized LDS of course, and active in church activities. They hope to bring their father into the church someday.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During high school I was secretary in the Sunday School, Sunday School organist, and Primary ‘Blue Bird’ teacher. During college days I was active in the LDS Institute. In our present Westchester Ward in California I have been Relief Society organist from 1959 to the present.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“To me life has always been interesting, with wonderful experiences. Working in a National Park winter and summer was a rare opportunity for observing nature and wild life. The C.A.A. was another enriching experience, as control of air traffic is intensely complex and fascinating and I met many interesting people - my employer, L. Ponton de Arce, for instance, was one of the men who originated our system of air traffic control as we know it today. I also got to see a good-looking naval officer now and then, named Sherman Christensen, a cousin from the office of Commander Max Black.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My work as a pianist in dance bands since I was sixteen has given me the chance to meet and observe countless people during their lighter moments - very revealing. I enjoy people and love to play the piano, so this has been a painless though demanding way of earning during the years. My husband and I still play, more as a hobby now, but the demand always seems to be there,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have too many wonderful memories of my parents to even begin to share them at this time. Their influence on my life was always for good - I cultivated my own faults!”</p>
