  <h2 class="calibre9" id="kjallerup-1847-1852">KJALLERUP … 1847-1852</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The mind does strange things in the quiet of the night. It is as if I were not here in Utah’s Zion, writing, this February 1969 but in the small village of Kjallerup in northwestern Jutland, Denmark, one hundred and twenty-two years ago… . Autumn … . Summer… . Spring… . the seasons and the years roll back and the breath of another winter comes over the North Sea licking its hoarfrost and spreading snow over the land like an ermine blanket to shroud the death of summer. It is the forepart of February 1847, Days are shortened and folks lean forward over the work in their hands. Lanterns are hung in the barns for both milkings and women run errands with their shawls clutched over their heads. The wind howls and the bitterness of ice is in the air. The mail coach comes but seldom now, but when it comes it comes with a great stir, horn a-blowing and bells a-jangling through the snowy dusk, as hoofs of horses clatter on the frozen ground.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the warm thatched cottage of Anders, son of Christen, things are in a hustle. Bedstemoder Karen is trying to hush and settle the little ones, wee Karen and Mads, while her son Anders is hurrying to pull on his great boots as his wife</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-63" title="63"></span> Mette, from her couch, face wreathed in pain, urges him to be gone. It’s a harsh night to be out in but he must hitch the wagon and fetch the midwife. Donning his sheepskin coat he chides eight year old Christen - “Now mind the log fire for your Mor”, and as Mette cries out again, adds quickly: “Ja, Ja - I go now”. Pulling his fur cap low he turns to the door, bracing himself for the weather outside. He hopes this baby will be another boy - a man can use sons on a farm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anders himself had been born in this small farming village of Kjallerup forty years ago come April, and had lived on this very farm as long as he could remember. His father, Christen Christensen, had come from the town of Vestervig south and his mother, Karen Andersdatter, from the village of Jannerup north, some years before his birth and settled here midway between the two places and raised their family. Five children had blessed their union in Kjallerup. Anders’ older sister, Inger Cathrine, now Fru Peder Larsen of Hvidbjerg, and his two younger brothers, Niels and Niels Christian, were still about, but he could hardly remember his baby sister, Ane Kirstine, who had died at less than two months of age some thirty-seven years ago. Anders’ mind went back as he rode through the February cold towards the midwife’s cottage, When his father had become old and unable to look after the farm, he himself being the oldest son had taken over and looked after things and his parents as well, When the aged man passed on when nearing 78 years, 13 Feb. 1838, he had continued to live there on the farm and care for it and his mother. The two of them had lived there alone until she kept at him to find himself a wife, which was no easy matter for a hard to please “ungkarl” (bachelor) like himself. But then he had found the comely Mette, whose parents lived in the small farming village of Svindborg, Orum Parish, southwest a few miles from Kjallerup.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anders thought of their marriage, 5 Dec. 1843, which took place at Hvidbjerg Vesten Aa Kirke (Parish Church at Hvidbjerg West of the River) Thisted Amt, Denmark, not far from their home <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-64" title="64"></span> in Kjallerup, The Priest who performed the ceremony also recorded it in the Parish Church records, putting Anders down as “Brudgommen - Ungkarl og gaardmand, 36 aar gammel” (Bridegroom bachelor, farmer, 36 years of age) and putting Mette down as “Bruden - Pige, 32 aar gammel” Bride - unwed female, 32 years of age). Anders also remembered that when Mette had come to live with him and his seventy year old mother Karen, she had brought her young son Christen with her. The child was then nearly four years old, having been born to Mette out of wedlock, 14 Mar. 1839, and Lyngholm Mark, Hvidbjerg Parish.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mette herself had been born 3 Apr. 1811 in the village of Svindborg, Orum Parish, Denmark, the daughter of gaardmand Christen Hviid og fru af Svindborg” (farmer Christen Hviid and wife of Svindborg). Little was known, apparently, of her mother, Else Andersdatter, except that she had given her husband seven children, three sons and four daughters, Mette herself being the youngest of these, On the other hand much more was know of her father, Christen Jensen Hviid (Hviid meaning White in English), he having descended way back from a Danish nobleman family - of which he never forgot to be proud. Some people are like that and carry the importance of their forebearers to the point that they set themselves above speaking to common folk and hold themselves aloof, though they themselves are practically nothing. Not that Mette and her parents and kinfolk weren’t fine people - on the contrary; yet Mette, like her father, was perhaps overly proud of her heritage and was often “lifted high” by the nobility in her blood. At times she seemed to feel it more than others, thought Anders, and then she’d put on airs - but after all!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anders had learned to live with this although he himself took little stock in such things. His own progenitors had been simple country Danes, Jutlandic peasants living there in Thy at least as far back as the time when Christian IV took over the Danish about the end of the sixteenth century. There was a record of his direct line at least that far back but his kin were certain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-65" title="65"></span> ancestors had even been there on the peninsula at the time of the Vikings and before, fighting away to keep their lands and freedoms on this fringe of northwestern Jutland. Anders had no complaint with life. Hadn’t Mette given him a daughter right away and then a son of his own? Two fine children in three years and now a third was on its way. This thought brought him back to the present with a start. How his mind had skipped around and busied itself as he had jogged along, his breath frosty on the air, forgetting the cold in the warmth of his memories.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He hurries the horses. There is no time for thinking his own thoughts once the chatty midwife has bundled herself into the wagon beside him, or back at the cottage either where Mette lies crying out in pain. Had it not been so biting cold Anders would have stayed outside with the livestock and left the women to it. As it is, however, he brings in more logs and feeds the fire since young Christen, despite his chiding, has let it grow low and gone off to sleep. That boy is poor to heed! Anders replenishes the kettle and gets the water to boiling, for use of the midwife, and then turns his hands to odds and ends of other small tasks while he waits patiently for a glimpse of his second own son. But it was not a son but a healthy baby daughter that Mette presents to Anders on that 9th day of February 1847 in their thatched cottage in Kjallerup, Thisted, Denmark… .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The scene in Kjallerup fades and I am back at my writing here in Provo, Utah this February of 1969, thankful for the warmth of my gas heated home with its electric lights and hot and cold running water as well as the other other comforts afforded me in this day and age. Rather regretfully my mind comes back to now for there is work to do here. Before me on the table are many written details pertaining to the lives of our Danish progenitors - notes, journals, old letters, maps - jottings from the memories of their children and grandchildren assembled and sorted long after the events they describe are one with the years. I pick up some of these and read them <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-66" title="66"></span> over - yes, these I must include in this history, but where and how? Yet I cannot keep my thoughts from returning to the area of Jutland, Denmark and the Danish peasants who lived and loved and walked the earth there so many years ago. And I know I must go back there, as imagination dictates, and follow this newly born baby girl and her associates throughout the remainder of her life and tell her story as I see it; for she is my Danish grandmother and very precious to me indeed!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That they should name this second daughter of theirs for Mette’s mother, Else, was natural since their first girl had been named for Anders’ mother, Karen, who lived there with them. Anders may have thought that she should have the name of his only living sister, Inger Cathrine, also, since Danes often gave their children a whole string of names. Mette probably objected to Inger but consented to add the Cathrine - so Else Cathrine was the name agreed upon. The Lutheran or State Church to which they belonged prescribed that a first sprinkling could be done in the home as soon after a birth as possible lest the child “die uncleansed and be damned forever”. This home baptism could be done by any male if the Priest were not on hand, such as the landlord, gardner, etc., or even by the father himself. Then as soon thereafter as could be arranged, weather permitting, the family needs must travel to the Parish church to register the birth and “Hjemmendøbt” (home baptism) of the infant, show it off as evidence to the congregation, have the whole affair officially recorded by the Priest and likely pay him a goodly fee in the bargain for his trouble in taking care of the “Fremstillingen i Kirken” (official recognition in the church).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Baby Else’s home baptism was taken care of the very day after her birth but it was not until 14 Mar. 1847 that the members of her family, attired in their best, drove with her in the wagon a mile-and-a-bit down the country road to the Parish church in the neighboring village of Hvidbjerg and had her naming and sprinkling duly acclaimed and recorded by the Lutheran Priest there. A copy of her “Fødsels og daabattest” (birth and baptism <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-67" title="67"></span> certificate) reads as follows: “Andersen, Else Cathrine; Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg sogn, Hassing herred, Thisted Amt; 1847- 9 februar; Hjemmedøbt 1847- 10 februar; fremstillet i Hvidbjerg kirken 1847- 14 marts; Gaardmand Anders Christjan Christensen og hustru Mette Kirstine Christensdatter.” The English interpretation gives us the following information: Else Cathrine Andersen, born 9 Feb. 1847 in Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg Parish, Hassing District, Thisted county (Denmark), baptized at home 10 Feb. 1847; official recognition and recording of birth and baptism at the Hvidbjerg Parish church 14 Mar. 1847; Parents - Farmer Anders Christian Christensen and wife, Mette Kirstine Christensdatter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Who was there to know at this recording that a hundred and twenty-two years hence, thousands of miles away, one of the descendants of this same Else Cathrine Andersen would be eagerly searching a copy of this self-same record for the very information which was written down there by the Priest of that small parish church in Denmark on 14 Mar. 1847? Indeed, who was there to know or even dream then of things to come, much less of the significant destiny of that little child? The Great Maker of destinies must have marked it well, however, and then turned attention to goings-on in other parts of the world.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">It was bitter weather also on the western American frontier that February 1847. In the territory of Nebraska at a place known as Winter Quarters, which was situated on the west bank of the Missouri River opposite Kanesville, Iowa, were gathered some 3,500 peculiar people calling themselves “Latter-day Saints”, popularly referred to as “Mormons”. Poorly sheltered from the weather in hurridly built log or sod houses, they were the vanguards of some 20,000 “Saints” who had been much persecuted and driven from their comfortable homes. In the bleak cold of the previous winter, these Mormons had crossed the icebound Mississippi in a body and traveled northwesterly across Iowa in a continuous procession, carrying along with them, in mournful wagon trains, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-68" title="68"></span> their sick and dying, wounded, lame and blind, and tarrying in various small settlements along the way. At the top of every hill they stopped and looked back towards their once proud city of Nauvoo with its beautiful temple. The “Saints” had been so driven from many fair cities and cozy homes:—from Ohio - to Missouri - to Illinois - to lowa in few more than a dozen years. Cruel mobs who had threatened and driven them from their last abodes were now the owners of their beautiful city and the smiling countryside around. These were the mobs who had stopped their ploughs, silenced their hammers, their axes, who had put out their fires, eaten their food for which they now hungered, spoiled their orchards, and trampled underfoot their thousands of acres of unharvested grain; these were now the keepers of their comfortable homes and the carousers in their holy temple, whose drunken riots insulted the ears and polluted the very air there. The last company of the driven Saints, the old, unable and destitute, or the remnants of the people, who it was hoped could stay on there unmolested until wagons returned to take them, turned, when on the opposite shore, and beheld a sight sorrowful to their eyes indeed; they saw all the struggles, sweat, toil, dreams and sacrifices of the past six years go up in flames; for lastly, the mobsters burned their glorious Nauvoo temple. So here in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, the vanguard of these once-again homeless people were camped that winter of 1847; there were many widows and sick among them and burials were frequent. All were poor in earthly goods, but the poorer were helped by the better off. Come Spring they intended to move on west across the great American plains in search of a new home. Though they had lost their great Prophet, their city, their temple and their homes, and were shivering and hungry in temporary shelters in Indian territory, it seemed they could not be defeated in their purposes; for they still had their God, and through their trust in him they rose above every discouragement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the same time, Christian VIII was King in Denmark; it was the last full year of his reign. The country was making brave effort to get on its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-69" title="69"></span> feet again after having lost its ponderous navy. The peasants were making agricultural progress but behind the atmosphere of modest demands and thriftiness there was a sort of paralyzing bitterness. The Danish people, it appeared, could not fully get over the grave shocks and losses their country had suffered, despite the white sails that could once more be seen tacking in and out between the five hundred green islands. Even so, as often during periods of discouragement and reflection, new ideas, evaluations, and intellectual movements were dawning there too. It was during this time that Denmark’s great writer of fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen, wandered around the streets of his homeland and wrote the stories that were to gain him world renown, It was then and there that Soren Kierkegaard, the theological philosopher, and Grundtvig, the spiritual revivalist, both strolled and thought, and here that Adam Oehlenschläger, Denmark’s national poet, both lived and wrote. Yes, writers wrote and people read, but no matter how idyllic everything appeared, in the old Danes’ hearts was still the memory of how things had been before. Sarcastic criticism of the old autocratic system of government, which it was felt was responsible for the catastrophe, could be heard in many circles, and even some youths in the Capitol enthusiastically demonstrated for “liberty”. Too, there was a growing spirit of “German nationalism” in the Danish provinces of Holstein and South Slesvig, which the Danish people in general viewed with concern, but which no one seemed able to do much about, leastwise King Christian VIII. The restlessness there was obviously becoming more critical by the hour when this melancholic, disappointed King died and his son, Frederick VII, became the country’s Absolute Monarch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But this new king, who took over in 1848, was neither loved nor admired; there was much gossip about him in the Kingdom, since “he had already wrecked two marriages, and was vague and moody and not even considered reliable…” So the Danes decided this was the time to do something about a few things! A number of leading citizens formed a delegation and called upon <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-70" title="70"></span> Frederick VII and suggested to him that the Danish people were somewhat “fed up” and were pretty well set on having more say in matters of State. Now Danes are apt to call a spade a spade or an axe an axe any day; they seldom beat-around-the-bush or mince words, even with Kings; so it is supposed that they more or less demanded a new form of government and struck a blow for “freedom” then and there. At least the new King must have known what they meant, for he acquiesced, and Absolute Monarchy toppled in Denmark that year of 1848. A number of meetings were held in the Capitol and a “constituent assembly” gathered in order to draw up the plans for a new constitutional democracy. Almost at the same time, however, the uprising that had been simmering for some time down in the province of Holstein came to a full boil! A certain member of German royalty took advantage of things and informed the people down there that the citizens of Copenhagen had risen in rebellion and were threatening the King. The Holsteiners were not interested in the freedom of the country but only in their own. So, while the King was engaged in other business, they considered this a good time to pullout. Thus the Prince of Noer was able to assume power in the south and gathered a revolutionary army composed of Holsteiners and volunteers who streamed in from other German States to help. They said, if not in so many words, “Now we Holsteiners are leaving you, Denmark, and going over to Germany where our sympathies are, and we’re going to take the whole of Slesvig with us!” And the Danes apparently believed them and went to war to save Slesvig. The first battles were won by the Danish, but when Prussia came in against them Denmark was terribly upset. The war lasted three years but there was only fighting during the summer; every time the sun came out the battles started again. Finally Prussia withdrew and the Holsteiners retreated and the Danes were victorious. The end came 25 July 1850 and Slesvig and Hol- stein remained with Denmark. During the course of the war the “Constituent Assembly” had completed its work and on 5 June 1849 the new constitution was signed. Many Danes began <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-71" title="71"></span> scratching their heads and talking over this and that, since all men thirty or past could now vote and had a greater say in matters.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1">But the child Else knew naught of these things; she was growing happily and healthily under the loving care of Mor Mette and the proud, watchful eyes of Far Anders. Truly she was after their hearts! Before her second spring it was well known in this Danish household that still another child was on the way; and the father ploughed and sowed and dreamed of many sons. The golden harvest was over and the threshing nearly done when, on the 12th of Oct. 1848, another daughter came to that home on the farm in Kjallerup. They named this one Ane, after Ander’s dead sister, with her second name Kirstine, the same as Mette’s, but they always called her “Stine”. She was the fairest of little ones but less robust than the others. Now Anders loved his children, but mayhaps he considered a majority of females on a farm a poor arrangement. Possibly he mentioned to his wife that henceforth they should sleep with an axe under their bed; the old Scandinavians wagered this was a sure way to get a boy. But whether or not he did, or they did, nothing came of it; for on 23 Jan. 1850 another daughter arrived at their cottage. She was tiny and sickly, so they had her sprinkling right away and gave her the name of Edel Marie Andersen. She died a day past three weeks, 14 Feb. 1850. (Did Anders feel this to be a punishment for his undue yearnings for a son?) Later, on a bitter winter day, they took the little corpse to the churchyard at Hvidbjerg to be buried, and the Priest recorded her birth, christening and death at one and the same time. If Else knew of her wee sister’s passing she soon forgot; for though she was extremely apt and quick to learn she was, after all, only just past three when they laid Edel in her grave.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As Else grew older there were short trips in the wagon to think of; especially did she enjoy going to church on Sundays at Hvidbjerg, in her best frock, starched petticoats and cap (one always wore the head covered in church) and little <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-72" title="72"></span> highbuttoned shoes over hand-knit stockings, always black. The church was cold and dark inside, both summer and winter, even with candles burning; but the walls and ceilings were bright with pictures of Saints and Angels and garlands of leaves and flowers, if one could see. The Priest (or Pastor) in his dark long full robes, with a white ruff at his chin and a great cross hanging at his back, stood up in front and drolled out the long prayers and sermons, which were seldom if ever understood. There was somebody pumping the organ as it was being played for hymns. (When she was confirmed she could have her very own hymn book with her name on.) On the outside there was the white church with the cross on top and the big bell ringing in the tower, the Priest’s house or Parsonage, and the garden of white tombs, some with little stone-lambs, where Edel lay;— Ja, these she would never forget! Sometimes the family went to Oveso (Ove Lake); they could walk there since it was less than a half mile east and a bit north of their cottage. One of the largest lakes in Thisted Amt, it ran diagonally from southeast to northwest a distance of about five miles through the very center of the county. There it lay, glittering in a frame of beech woods, where starlings made choirs in the trees, and sometimes one saw a great stork fly up. In summers, fishing boats with white sails were always drifting there, and Far Anders often fished there; but usually it was a family festival that took the rest of them to the water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the day-dark of winter, month after month, when even the old Danes sometimes wondered if spring would ever come, the lake was usually frozen over. The winters in Jutland seemed weary and long, especially to one as active and eager as Else. They were always so damp and cold, with much fog; snow piled higher than a child could see over, and frost biting nose and fingers. Then there was always the chill of the rough wind which came streaking across from the North Sea. The Andersens lived only about three miles in from that restless treacherous sea; sometimes they could hear it moan, as its waves crashed and broke upon the shore to the west. But still, in winters <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-73" title="73"></span> there were lessons to be had, for Mette was determined that her children were to be well-taught, as befitted descendants of noblemen! Young Christen, of course, had been attending school at the Church school since he was eight, for this had been the law of the land since Anders and Mette were children. But he was not always at Kjallerup, for sometimes he went to live with Mette’s mother, Bedstemoder Else, in Orum Parish, for she had raised him when he was small and he was at home there. The four younger children had wonderful times together playing the learning games Mette had for them. Else liked best the one where you held up your hand and crooked each finger in turn, while repeating, “Tommeltot (the thumb), Slikkepot (pointer), Langemand (middle finger), Guldbrand (ring finger), and Lille Peder Spillemand (little finger).” So, old Guldbrand got to wear the rings! Mette told her children that many important Danishmen in the big cities, and even on the better farms, wore rings on several fingers, and high silk hats, coats with polished buttons, and embroidered waistcoats, while their womenfolk wore flowered bonnets and elegant shawls. Someday, if they worked and studied hard, they too would be important!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In spring the wind went on and on, never seeming to run out of breath, like an old gossip; which was perhaps necessary, in the case of the wind, especially in Jutland, to dry up the land so farmers could start their ploughing. But very early in the spring of 1852, when the trees were still twiggy before the leaves came, Anders didn’t start his ploughing, as he was wont, but went instead to the police in the nearest place to Kjallerup, where they were, to secure authorized government permission to move his family elsewhere. This was the Danish law then. Each adult Dane possessed a “little Black Book” which had to be officially marked, or stamped, when consent was given for a change of residence, and rechecked when residence was taken up in another place. In this manner the Kingdom kept track of her people as they moved around; especially the men of military age, who had much difficulty in changing their areas of abode. Anders wished to sell the farm in Kjallerup, no doubt, and had perhaps found a good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-74" title="74"></span> buyer. He planned to move his family north a few miles to the somewhat larger town of Norhaa, closer to the place where his mother was born and where a number of her kinsfolk dwelt. The old Karen was longing to be nearer her own people. Whether the lack of more sons to help on the farm had anything to do with this is hard to tell, or perhaps Mette had visions of a finer cottage in which to raise her children and give birth to her next child, which was expected. Permission to move was granted and what a hustle and bustle and packing of things there must have been, Goodbyes had to be said to neighbors and friends, and Mette’s people in the Parish south had to be visited. Certainly they must have gone for the blessing of the Priest upon their move and his recommendation to their new Parish; and did they not stop to shed a tear beside Edel’s little mound?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the wagon was loaded to the hilt they set out west a quarter of a mile and then turned onto the wagon road leading northeast a couple of miles to the village of Istrup, and from thence around the west tip of Oveso, then skirting the small village of Legind they followed the muddy wagon road northwest another two miles until it joined with the main traveled road at Freskilde, where they turned and followed this new road west another mile-and-a-bit to Norhaa, where the church could be seen all shining white there.</p>
