  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Time was when Danes thought the only honorable death was a violent one. Denmark has had a terrible record of wars:—peasants uprising against nobles or kings and vice versa; nobles up-in-arms at the kings or the clergy; the Crown fighting the nobility or the Church. Then, if Danes were not scrapping among themselves they were warring with their neighbors—and no wonder. For the <span id="page-25"></span> greater part of a thousand years Denmark had to maintain a two-front postion involving constant threats from Sweden on her northeast and Germany on her southwest, with Russia always looking through the window. It was as though a pair of grasping pinchers had been suspended over the little Kingdom. Time and time again she has fought Sweden for the supremacy of Scandinavia and the Baltic, and so often she has been at war with powerful, dynamic Germany over the provinces of Holstein and Slesvig (Schleswig in German) which have been batted back and forth since the days of the Vikings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The small Kingdom has been ruled by “Christians” and “Fredericks”, with one King Hans thrown in, for the past 520 years, Forty-four years before Columbus came to America the first King Christian ascended the Danish throne—and the fighting went on as usual. Christian I (1448-1481) went to Sweden to settle matters there and his fleet won at sea, but it is said that as the two land armies advanced upon one another each leader prayed to St. George (of dragon fame) for victory. As the Swedes could pray in Latin and Christian only knew how in German, the Danes lost. The Dane’s king was more fortunate in the south however, for he united Slesvig and Holstein under his rule. He established the first Danish University also. King Hans went to war and united Sweden with Denmark and Norway again, but had to give all their nobles much greater power. He built the Danes’ first proper navy (ships especially for war) and established their first naval base.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian II (1513-1523), a dynamic, violent king with a big, red beard, loved beauty and culture, and he loved the Danish peasants too, He enacted measures which benefited them and curbed the powers of the nobles. This caused a terrible breach between them. He occasionally fell back on an ancient legal practice and called in twelve peasants from a village and had them pass judge- ment on a wayward noble, according to ancient Nordic custom, which they usually did with these words: “Not we but his deeds do judge him”. Christian II went into exile but was captured and <span id="page-26"></span> held prisoner in his own land for 36 years, at the command of his two successors, both of whom he outlived. The peasants fought to free him and make him king again, which brought on “The Counts War”, a great internal struggle involving tremendous bitterness and bloodshed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Frederick I (1523-1533) had to win the crown by force and maintain his position in the same way, for the peasants wanted the old king back, When Christian III (1535-1559) was throned, the peasants in north Jutland really rebelled; they marched against a well-armed force of Knights sent to quell them and inflicted a crushing defeat—then marched south, setting castles and manor-houses ablaze. Then the new King sent his army after them under his cruel Holstein general, Rantzau. The peasants retreated north and made a stand at Aalborg but Rantzau’s troops took the town by storm, plundered it thoroughly, slaughtered its inhabitants plus 2,000 other peasants who stood their ground there. Soon entire north Jutland was subdued and its peasants either executed or deprived of their “freeman” privileges. These forces then turned to Copenhagen, whose citizens were for the old king, and laid siege there. For more than a year her people held out—famine struck and they ate every cat and rat and even chewed the grass growing on the ramparts, while their dead piled up everywhere and they were forced to surrender. Christian III did away with the Catholic Church and installed Lutheranism in its stead. He made the convents and monasteries fiefs of the Crown and confiscated all Church property, which was considerable. From then on there has been no separation between Church and State in Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The lack of education of Frederick II (1559-1588) was appalling but his times were scholarly. (Denmark then had one of the finest scientific institutions of the day.) He fought a “Seven Year War” with Sweden, with no gain. Nor could he conquer his own appetites—he loved wine and drinking cut short his life. His son, Christian IV (1588-1648) became Denmark’s most renowned king, the one the Danes know best and for whom the national song, “King Christian”, was written. <span id="page-27"></span> He was a worker and a builder and founded towns and made improvements from one end of his realm to the other. He was jovial and his court was gay; loved music and fostered organ building; spoke several languages, founded colonies in India and elsewhere—and in fact he simply popped his nose into everything! But he made a mistake when he tried to aid certain German factions in their own thirty-year religious struggle—and Denmark’s Jutland paid the price. She was terribly ravaged by Germans, who destroyed her towns and pillaged her manors. Then the Swedes followed the Germans in and ransacked Jutland all over again. Christian IV became battle weary, disappointed and impoverished. His second wife divorced him, his friends deserted him, his many children took sides against him, and he had trouble with his sons-in-law. Lonely, bitter and practically forgotten he died, after having ruled Denmark longer than any other king (60 years), during which time Queen Elizabeth, James I and Charles I sat on the throne of England, in turn; the Puritans and Pilgrims sailed in droves to New England for religious freedom and the Atlantic Ocean replaced the Baltic and Mediterranean seas as monarch of the trading routes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Germany and Sweden continued on the warpath during the rule of Frederick III (1648-1670) and each marched again into Jutland—there wasn’t much left of her! The whole of south Jutland was paralyzed and very nearly depopulated, and it looked as if the Danes’ land was at last to be divided up between her two perennial enemies. Denmark saved her neck, fortunately, but was forced to sign the most expensive peace treaty of her life, giving Sweden a third of all her property—in fact, all of her territory east of the Sound, which included the valuable Scanian provinces. This was the most serious territorial loss she ever sustained. Then the Swedish king decided he might as well have all of Denmark while he was about it, so he sailed back and fell on Copenhagen unexpectedly. He laid seige to the city and, despite the fact that practically the whole of the rest of Denmark was in Swedish hands, her citizens decided to fight. Everybody got into the <span id="page-28"></span> act: the King pitched his tent on the ramparts in defiance; a friendiy Holland fleet fought its way through to help; women, children, students and citizens worked side by side and civilians and troops trained for battle. It was six months before the city was stormed (10 Feb. 1659) but the Danes were ready! While the men fought, women and children loaded muskets, dragged wooden beams and huge stones to be heaved down on the heads of the enemy and heated lye and water to boiling, to pour down if they tried to clamber up. Hour after hour and attack after attack the Danes fought tenaciously until the Swedes finally had enough. At least 3,000 of the invaders died but only 20 Danes. Copenhagen was free, Denmark was saved—but the prevailing mood was one of deepest gloom because of the destitute, crippled and reduced condition of the nation. The nobles were blamed for it all but were too enfeebled to rise up against anybody. So the King considered this an excellent time to have his full say and, after astute negotiations, proclaimed himself “Absolute Monarch” of Denmark and Norway. It was very unusual but there was no bloody revolution at all.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About this time the nobles were required to take definite surnames to be retained by succeeding generations of their posterity, in lieu of the patronymic pattern of surnaming then in common use in Denmark; ex. —the addition of the suffix “sen” to the given name of one’s father, if a male, and “datter” if a female. This new order of naming was designed to more fully identify the nobilities and their descendants from the commoners. Kings had been similarly set apart by nicknames, heraldic titles or numbers since the beginning. Peasants were not required by law to discard the patronymic form until 1828 in most cities and 1856 in general.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian V (1670-1699) built up the Kingdom and gave it a Statute Book of new laws by which he ruled honestly and well. One of the bloodiest battles ever fought in all of Scandinavia took place during his administration, when he and his army crossed over into Scania to try and win her back <span id="page-29"></span> from the Swedes. The main battle started off the dark winter morning of 4th Dec. 1676 with the cavalry forces of both armies rushing against each other. It lasted all day, and that evening, as rain drizzled down and darkness fell, almost 9,000 Danish and Swedish corpses lay stretched out in the muddy fields. It was a war of senseless havoc and destruction and the Scanian provinces were completely devastated. (These people were of the Danes own.) The Danes won at sea as usual but lost on land, and Sweden retained Scania. (Would the Danes then never learn?) Legend has it that from that day on Christian V had the windows of Kronborg Castle in Elsinor, which faced Scania, blocked up; he was unable to bear looking out across the water toward the green coast of the Danes’ lost land.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the American colonies wrote their Declaration of Independence and started the American Revolution, Christian VII (1766-1808) had been on the Danish throne for ten years, but he was quite incapable of ruling, Less than seventeen when he took the crown, he was slight of build and it soon became apparent that he was slightly mad too. (It is said that his chamberlain was no doubt largely to blame—he believed in using a firm hand and had cowed the young Prince by beating him.) His personal physician moved himself up in the government, post by post, until he gained absolute power and held the King in the hollow of his hand, as it were. But the doctor was finally condemned to death by popular demand. At this time the Dano-Norwegian fleet was strong and trading excellent. Slesvig and Holstein were under Danish control, but relations with England were at low ebb and war with Russia was threatening. Denmark’s industry was awakening and the famous Royal Copenhagen Porcelain factory was founded. Intellectual life unfolded; art, painting, drama, poetry, all came to the fore, Danes re-discovered the beauty of their ancient Nordic past and wrote of gods and goddesses and of love of their country. A spirit of nationalism grew and blossomed. One of the popular songs of the day was written by a Holstein bard:- “Let me rejoice that Danish blood within my veins doth flow”—and Danes everywhere <span id="page-30"></span> took up the refrain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But the Danish peasants then, unfortunately, had little to sing about. They had been largely deprived of their ancient freedoms, Most of their “Thing” meeting privileges had been taken away and they could no longer own land. Though they continued to live closely side by side in small vill- ages and cooperated in cultivating the community-owned property as in ancient times, they were forced to rent their individual farming land from the nobility or the Crown. For the use of these lands they paid “manorial dues”, a good part of which had to be worked off on the estates of the owners. The power these aristocratic bosses and their overseers wielded over the peasants was considerable. These often had to leave their own plantings and harvests to work endless hours taking care of those of their masters. Little these cared if the peasants’ crops failed from forced neglect and they were thus unable to pay the balance of their “dues”—they could work those off too (or take a beating in the bargain). Many were compelled to forfeit their fields and were reduced to little more than slaves. Others made out quite well and obtained a “copyhold” on the farms they rented, so that their sons could take them over from them at their deaths (though a land owner might transfer a son from a good farm to one that was neglected). Then, from the time of Christian VI (1730-1746), pleasants had been “bound to the soil”. This meant that all men in the rural areas were bound to remain living on the same estates or in the same villages or districts for the entire period in which they were liable for military service, at which time they were forced to fight in the King’s armies. Though peasants moved very little anyway, they felt that they were really being pushed around!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Frederick VI (1808-1839), who governed for his ill father as Crown Prince before he became King, served the Danish people for a total of fifty-five years. He set about early to improve agricultural conditions and to give the peasants of his land a new lease on life. He decreed that they could now own their own land, consolidate their various <span id="page-31"></span> fields, and decide for themselves how hard they toiled. If they continued to work for the nobles, from necessity or choice, their hours of labor were limited by law to give each peasant some time for his own fields or affairs. This was a great reform, and in gratitude for it a monument, “Liberty Obelisk”, was erected to the “liberation of the peasants” and stands today in the center of Copenhagen. It wasn’t long until the old communal villages were abolished and the more progressive peasant-Danes moved onto their own farms or into neighboring small towns.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since the middle of the 18th century the most common flag seen on the Seven Seas, after the British, was that of the Dano-Norwegian merchant navy. The latter part of that century England had lost the American Revolution and was now involved with the French. She began casting her eyes on Denmark and Norway (after generations of ignoring them) in hopes of embroiling them in this fight as allies. But the twin countries managed to keep themselves free of entanglements for a time and enjoyed a period of tremendous prosperity in shipping and trade. England demanded that their ships cease calling at French ports, and in order to enforce this, started seizing Dano-Norwegian merchant vessels. The Scandinavians joined with Russia in an armed neutrality pact, their motto was, “Free ships, free cargo!” The situation became critical. Early in 1801 England sent a fleet into Danish waters under Admirals Parker and Nelson. It was a most strategic time since Denmark’s allies’ ships (Russia’s) were ice-bound and her own fleet was in winter quarters, dismantled and crews demobilized. After bombing Elsinore: the English sailed straight for Copenhagen with 35 ships, 1,192 guns, 14 cannons and 8,885 experienced men against a hurriedly gathered Danish force of 630 guns and: 5,234 men, mostly volunteers. After five hours of violent lopsided fighting (though the Danes fought bravely) the Danish forces were defeated, over half being wounded and hundreds. killed. But the Danes spirits were not defeated—their spunk was up, and they continued their trade and tried to steer clear of the flames of war. The French Revolution ended with the founding of <span id="page-32"></span> Napoleon’s Empire and his starting to do just about as he pleased with all of Europe. Then Denmark and Norway, with the second largest fleet in the world, decided to join with England, in spite of her earlier attacks on the Danes; since to go against this world’s greatest maritime power would be catastrophic for them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark enjoyed six more peaceful years, with trade as usual, but apparently forgot to convince England that she was on her side, because on the last of August 1807 Crown Prince Frederick was visited by an English envoy who demanded that Denmark enter into an alliance with his country and hand her over the entire Dano-Norwegian navy in pawn for the duration of the “present situation.” Now Frederick was down on Jutland’s Neck with most of his army, preparing for battle with Napoleon’s forces who were marching towards the Danish border. He couldn’t believe the English were serious (after all, they were now friends!) He said he would “think it over”, then hurried to Copenhagen to see what was going on, and arrived just as a huge English fleet with 30,000 men, was casting anchor in the Sound. He made meager preparations for an attack there, still doubting it would come, and rushed back to Jutland to await Napoleon. The English delivered a final notice and then, as the Danes were silent, prepared to bomb Copenhagen from all sides. Indignant, to say the least, its citizens got ready for battle, as they had 150 years ago with the Swedish. There were some 100,000 inhabitants crowded behind the old ram- parts of the city but only 12,000 men able to fight. For three days the bombs reigned down upon them—they hadn’t a chance and had to give in. This time the fleet was to be war booty, not a pawn. Two days after, flames were still crackling in the houses and smoke still pouring through the streets, while approximately 2,000 corpses still laid unburied and more than 1,000 people lay wounded, wherever space could be found. The English seized the royal dockyard and all the storehouses and occupied the harbor. All ships were made ready for sea; those they could not take were hacked to pieces. Every single thing was stuffed on board, even to the last chart and telescope; <span id="page-33"></span> whereafter the entire Dano-Norwegian fleet then stationed there, was hauled out of the harbor for the last time. There went the pride and joy of two kingdoms gliding out to sea. “The beaches were black with people watching in deadly silence as their beloved vessels slid slowly past—and Danish naval officers wept.” The whole affair seemed so absurd. There was no proof whatsoever of any hostile intentions on Denmark’s part or of the necessity of attacking Copenhagen at all. (We can’t take anything away from the English though, for they were gentlemen all the way—they left commissioners behind to pay for their board and room and gallantly left a pleasure frigate that had been presented as a gift to the Crown Prince by his uncle, the King of England.) There were com- plaints in many quarters outside Denmark, including some of the members of England’s own House of Lords.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Denmark was sucked into the European whirlpool, there could be no doubt now where she must stand. She joined with Napoleon and, though for seven years England controlled her territorial waters, waged a gunboat war against her. Norway was the hardest hit, as her coasts were blockaded till famine came, and in the midst of it Sweden took her over. This terminated the 439 year union between the twin kingdoms, Norway and Denmark. Denmark’s days of prosperity were over. The war with England had completely destroyed her maritime trade. Her tiny distant colonies were cut off and her national economy was bankrupt. She had nothing left outside her poor, beaten. country except Greenland, the world’s largest island (mostly a cake of ice), the Virgin Islands (which she later sold), the Faroe Islands in the northern Atlantic, and Iceland. (Incidentally, Iceland and Denmark had been united under the same kings for 564 years, when Iceland took advantage and dissolved this union abruptly, as Denmark struggled for her very existence under the occupation of the Germans during Herr Hitler’s rampage of 1939-1944. This Icelandic treatment was a last straw; it was like kicking a pal when he is down.) <span id="page-34"></span> Things looked pretty black, but Frederick VI still sat on his throne with his dearly beloved family about him; “he was father to his people and their contact with the past, which seemed to be collapsing so unmercifully”. But the country still existed—Denmark had survived another catastrophe. She had often been involved in the political strife of Europe, often ravaged by foreign troops or written off as an independent State by her neighbors; but she had never been completely conquered or sub- jected to foreign dominion—somehow she had always managed to pull through. Oh yes, she had had her days and her moments, but the country was too small to stay “great”. Slowly trade started again and shipbuilding, poetry-making and painting. (Danes then mostly painted ships—great men-o’-war with billowing white sails ploughing through the water, in and out among the bright green islands.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the old King died in 1839 he was generally mourned. With him a whole era passed to the grave—a Denmark that would never return. It was an era of reverses and deep disappointments, and perhaps mistakes, “but after all it was asking quite a lot to be able to steer a Ship of State unscathed through the typhoon that Napoleon loosed over Europe.” Danish peasants carried the King’s coffin along the last part of the road from Copenhagen to the cathedral in Roskilde, where Denmark’s royal heads are buried. He had truly been their friend.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian VIII (1839-1848), the old king’s cousin, was bitter and disappointed; for though Danish ships were sailing again, things were not the same. It was much too obvious that Denmark’s position among nations had sunk so low that she hardly counted anymore. There was sarcastic criticism of the old autocratic form of government in many Danish circles, and when King Christian VIII died, after nine years of rule, the crisis came to a head. His son, Frederick VII (1848-1863), was neither loved nor admired. There was unrest all over Europe. Shots were ringing out in the streets of Berlin and Paris. “In Denmark feelings mounted to such extraordinary heights that a number <span id="page-35"></span> of honest citizens donned their top hats and frock coats and went to see the King and told him they wanted a free constitution. They got it!” (Revolutions in Denmark always took place in a special Dane’s-way.) A constitutional assembly began drawing up a new constitution, and then an uprising broke out in Holstein and Denmark went to war again to save Jutland’s neck, this time against Holstein rebels. After three summers of fighting, in which Prussia joined against the Danes, the matter was straightened out and Slesvig and Holstein remained in Danish hands. In the meantime the new constitution was signed (5 June 1849) and Denmark’s Absolute Monarchy was overthrown after 190 years. She was now to be governed by an assembly consisting of two chambers, “Folketing” or Lower House and “Landsting” or Upper House. The King’s rights were laid down constitutionally and all Danish men, aged 30 and above, were granted the right to vote—“one man, one vote”. Without the Danes ancient and inspired love of freedom and their tradition of self-governing settlements as a background, their new “Democracy” might have failed, but as it was, the neverending cry for “Liberty” was heard and, answered again!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The London Protocol dated 2 Aug. 1850, and signed by Denmark and all other important European powers, pledged to uphold the integrity and: unity of Denmark’s new Constitutional Monarchy. A later treaty set and approved the royal succession of Danish rulers and supposedly settled, once and for all, the thorny question of Slesvig and Holstein by giving them to Denmark with an international blessing. Still a later treaty (1857) did away with Denmark’s “sound dues”, for which she was promised the equivalent of some 2,000,000 pounds. In turn, Denmark agreed to continue to police the “Sound” and set up additional lighthouses all around her ragged coasts. Danish waters were feared by seafaring folk, especially off west Jutland where, year after year, ships went aground and were reduced to matchwood by the merciless waves of the cruel North Sea. The new government got off to a good start and Denmark began to find her way again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span id="page-36"></span> Since Frederick VII had no sons the Danish crown passed, as per treaty, to Christian IX of the House of Glucksburg (1863-1906). Both he and his queen belonged to the old Danish Royal House. It has remained with him and his direct descendants for the past 104 years, or to the present. The old headache of Slesvig and Holstein came up again and war with Prussia and Austria resulted—they came and took away the two provinces, so Denmark was reduced again. Frederick VIII served for only six years (1906-1912), but his son, Christian X, ruled 35 years (1912-1947) and had the two great World Wars to worry him. World War I was not so bad, as Denmark tried to stay aloof, but 100 of her ships were hit by German submarines, with no consideration at all. Two good things came of it however: Danish women got the right to vote and the League of Nations gave Slesvig the right to vote too on where she wished to be, and only north Slesvig Subjects chose Denmark, and so Jutland’s neck was finally divided up and thus it remained.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The small-land-Danes have actually only lost 28 miles of their original territory to big, husky Germany over the centuries they have been fighting for it. But they nearly lost all of Denmark in World War II, when Hitler’s Germans moved in on them. Had it not been for the efforts of their “Freedom Council”, who engaged in a saboteur’s war, aided, and directed in the end, by radio from England, they could have. Denmark fought from within and the whole thing was a nightmare! A noble effort was made in behalf of the Danish Jews, 8,000 strong. The Gestapo had their eyes on them and, after nearly four years of occupying their country, decided on the “High Holy Days” to tend to their extermination. But it never happened, for the Danish risked everything they had to save their fellow Danes, the Jews. In brilliant feats of courage on all sides, those of the underground helped the Israelites to escape to Sweden and safety; few were lost. There have been no race riots in Denmark—only wars.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When it was announced that Hitler was dead, and the Danes realized the war was nearly over, it was feared that the final battle would be fought in <span id="page-37"></span> Jutland and Denmark braced herself for the attack as, hour after hour, the fighting front came closer, The final phase of World War II was enacted, literally, on the Danish border. When word finally got around that the Nazis had capitulated, Danish resistance groups began settling accounts and taking care of a few matters, and the Germans and the Danish traitors couldn’t get out of the country fast enough! In Denmark there was the biggest festival of all:—cheering, laughing, dancing in the streets, and Danish flags flapping all over. She was saved again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the thousand years in which history has accounted for the royal heads of Denmark, there have been over a half hundred ruling there—good kings, bad kings, a dead one and a mad one, and one uncrowned queen. By far the majority of these have been sober-minded, sensible people. It seems that there has always existed in Denmark an ancient, unfailing ability to choose, more or less, the right leaders. Frederick IX is ruling there now and has been for the past 22 years (1947- ). Greenland has been made a Country instead of a Colony, one house of the Danish Parliament has been abolished, “Landsting”, and women lately have at last been given equal rights to become Danish rulers, just as men. Since Frederick IX has no sons, his daughter Margrethe is heir apparent and will likely become Denmark’s first crowned queen. The feeling still persists that in Denmark, in spite of the blackest days, things can never go really wrong; for she has always pulled through in the past. But—her position at the gates of the Baltic is still vulnerable, as always, and one cannot help but think that Russia (the Great Bear) has her eyes on her and is mightily interested in seeing how she handles herself and that gateway. Then, during the last few decades, Denmark’s government has leaned heavily toward Socialism. One cannot help wondering if freedom once again is gasping for breath in that lovely land of the green islands. War is not always the way.</p>
