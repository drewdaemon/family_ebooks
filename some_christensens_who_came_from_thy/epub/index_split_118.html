        <p class="calibre1">Actually, Niels Christian’s birth (23 Apr 1853) as well as his christening in church two days later do appear in the Gettrup parish register (1849-73, p. 8), as do his death (21 Sep) and burial (2 Oct, p. 102). Karen did, however, deliver a stillborn male child the following Apr 5th (p. 8).  It may be that they had intended to name this child, if a boy, after the infant Niels Christian who had died a few months earlier and therefore thought of this stillborn child as a second Niels Christian.  In the end, though, it was their youngest daughter Nielsine Christiane (b. 1862)  who was named after Niels Christian.&#160;<a href="index_split_016.html#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>

        <p class="calibre1">This notation is not in a journal but at the end of Else K.‘s large notebook, which contains her midwife training, log of babies delivered, etc.  In a brief biographical summary on p.  94, she gives (in Danish) Laurs’  and her dates of birth, followed by important events related to their church membership.  In her case, “baptized 25 January 1865 by Lars Hansen, received the laying on of hands the same day by Lasen Jensen in Bested, Thisted, Denmark.” Then for both: “Were married 22 April 1866 in Aalborg Denmark.  Traveled to Utah the year 1866.  Received our endowment 28 October 1871.  Were baptized into the United [Forenede] Order 1875.”  This is followed by a listing of their children.&#160;<a href="index_split_023.html#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>

      <li id="fn:4" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">This translation has been adjusted for the digital edition. “Begyndte” means ‘began’ not ‘beginning’ and “Undervisning” means ‘instruction’ not ‘understudying.’&#160;<a href="index_split_024.html#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>

      </li>

      <li id="fn:5" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">These instructions, comprising pp. 1-23 of Else’s notebook, are clearly in a different hand from Else’s, whose log of babies delivered and other entries, in her own distinctive hand, begin p. 25.  It is probable that Nicolene Olsen herself wrote the detailed instructions as she was teaching Else. This part was later separately translated by Virginia’s nephew Bryce Christensen, who had earlier also translated the Danish letters for her book.  (Bryce served as a young man in Denmark.) A scan of Else’s large notebook, Bryce’s translation of the training, and a photo of her medical bag can be found under Memories on Else K.‘s FamilySearch page.&#160;<a href="index_split_024.html#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">↩</a></p>

      <li id="fn:6" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">This brown kit or medical bag and the blood-letting knife (depicted on p. 280a) passed from Else K. to her son Albert.  In the bag were stored Else’s notebooks, letters from family members in Denmark, and other documents.  As the Preface indicates, these very nearly got thrown out some time after Albert’s death but fortunately were given to Albert’s daughter Virginia.  From Virginia, the bag and the notebooks went to her daughter Colleen Jones, then to Virginia’s nephew Bryce Christensen.  Bryce gave these on to George Tate in 2017 to donate to the Church History Library (the notebooks) and the Church History Museum (the medical bag). These are now in the Lauritz Mathias Christian Christensen (1847-1926) and Else Kathrine Andersen Christensen (1847-1923) collection at those institutions.  The blood-letting instrument passed to Albert’s son A. Sherman, then to Sherman’s son A. Kent, a professor of medicine who died in 2017.  It is still in Kent’s family.&#160;<a href="index_split_024.html#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">↩</a></p>

        <p class="calibre1">This wonderful sealing session of 14 Nov 1888 is recorded at the end of Christen Christensen’s temple record book (p. 58).  It indicates which living children were proxy for their deceased siblings: Pauline for Maren and the first Petrine, Nielsine for Ane Marie and the second Petrine, and Laurs for Peter and Niels.  Christen’s wife Ane was proxy for his first wife Karen.  D. H. Wells sealer, John Alder and Thomas Higgs witnesses, M. F. Farnsworth recorder.&#160;<a href="index_split_024.html#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">↩</a></p>

      <li id="fn:8" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">In the translation of the letter on p. 311, one son, Johannes, was accidentally omitted and his birth date assigned to the next oldest, Hans Tausen.  It should read, “Hans Tausen M. Skaarup, born 1 Feb 1877; Johannes M. Skaarup, born 28 July 1878.”  This omission has been corrected here.  (The middle initial M. of the original has been expanded to Mikkelsen for each child.)&#160;<a href="index_split_026.html#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text">↩</a></p>

      <li id="fn:9" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">Nessum=Naessund in Heltborg parish, where the births of Christen’s children were recorded. Christen and his wife Else Marie Andersen had twelve children, of whom one died in infancy, three in childhood, and one by drowning at 17 in the North Sea.  The rest eventually moved away.&#160;<a href="index_split_031.html#fnref:9" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text">↩</a></p>

      </li>

      <li id="fn:10" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">This passage has been revised for the digital edition.  The earlier printed  translation is misleading in two ways especially:  The original Danish letter makes no mention of Frederikshavn (in Eastern Jutland), nor of a house being built for them there, nor does it say that Stine died in Copenhagen (“where she died”).  The original does mention Frederikssund (in NW Sjælland, the main island), where son Viggo was manager of the Cooperative.  This is where Stine, and later Svend, who lived with Viggo and his sister Dagmar, died.  (Hence Marie’s “so far from us.”)  Only when the original letter, instead of the translation, was consulted was it possible to find out where they spent their last days.  The earlier translation also occasionally rearranges the sequence of passages, but this is not really a problem.&#160;<a href="index_split_034.html#fnref:10" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text">↩</a></p>

      </li>

      <li id="fn:11" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">The original translation reads, without commas, “who live in Aarhus,” which is understandable since singular and plural verbs (here “bor”) are the same in Danish and the letters are rarely punctuated.  But we know from the previous letter and other records that Viggo was living in Frederikssund; only Aksel lived in Aarhus.&#160;<a href="index_split_034.html#fnref:11" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text">↩</a></p>

      <li id="fn:12" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">Edel Petrea (b. 1889) was not the youngest.  Thora Dusina (b. 1897) would have been 25 at the time and was living with her sister Valborg Hvid Sørensen in Hurup.  She would surely have been among those who arrived in the “Hurup car” for Mads’ birthday.&#160;<a href="index_split_034.html#fnref:12" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text">↩</a></p>

      </li>

      <li id="fn:13" class="calibre6">

        <p class="calibre1">In fact Christen’s wife (d. 1924) was still alive, but several of their twelve children had died young, and of those who lived to adulthood, none lived near;  two (Lydia and Daniel) had emigrated to America.  So Christen was indeed without children around him.&#160;<a href="index_split_034.html#fnref:13" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text">↩</a></p>
