  <p class="calibre1">(60) Marjorie Christensen (7) was born 6 Aug. 1922 in Evanston, Wyoming. It was in Lyman, Wyoming, however, where she spent most of her early life. It was here that she was baptized a member of the LDS church; here that she later taught in the Primary organization and where she acted as Sunday School Organist.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in Lyman also that she attended school. While at Lyman High School, from which she later graduated, she took typing, among other subjects, and became very efficient in it. In tests she established what was said to be a world’s record of 120 words per minute on a manual typewriter. She went to Provo, Utah to compete with other students from several states. During the first part of this test she found she had typed some with her fingers on the wrong keys so she quit typing. She probably could have won if she had started the test all over again since the winner made only 60 words per minute.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Like her older sisters Marjorie not only became a fine typist but an excellent pianist and singer as well. In 1940 she and her sister Alice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-929" title="929"></span> went to Ogden, Utah and lived for a time with their married sister LaFaun (then Slagowski). Here they obtained a spot on KLO Radio singing duets daily under the label ‘Alice &amp; Marj” - and they were very well liked. Then Alice received an offer as a full time piano player in Ely, Nevada, so Marjorie went there with her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in Ely that Marjorie met her future husband, Mart Eugene Strouse (b. 27 Feb. 1920 in Malad, Idaho to John Lawrence and Amelia Goddard Strouse). The two went to Evanston, Wyoming to be married, 14 Mar. 1941, with both of their fathers and mothers being present at the civil ceremony. The couple settled first in Ruth, Nevada but later moved to what was known as “New” Ruth, Nevada. Here the husband “Gene” became a supervisor at Kennecott Copper mine and has been such for many years. They had two children, a boy and a girl.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As is sometimes the case, heartaches come with raising a family. Their son Eugene died on the school grounds at “Old” Ruth, Nevada at age thirteen, supposedly of a heart attack. Their daughter, who married a cameraman at a TV studio in Los Angeles, was disappointed in her marriage and returned to her parents’ home before the birth of her first child. She later married happily, however.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marjorie, tall, slender, talented, and with a sweet personality and happy disposition, welcomed her parents into her home about a year before the death of her mother. In fact it was in her home in Ruth, Nevada that her mother passed away, Nov. 1952. She remembers as a youngster in Lyman, Wyoming her father chording on the guitar and singing. “Father had the best bass voice I ever heard. He sang solos in church and at church parties and always wished that he had received more special vocal training.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marjorie worked on a few occasions after her marriage. When her daughter, Barbara, was in eighth or ninth grade she worked for a year at nearby Ely, typing and selling sheet music and records in a music store. Her last job was typing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-930" title="930"></span> for the Red Cross in Ruth for a year or two. But mostly she has concentrated her time and energy in being “just a housewife”.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In late autumn of 1967 in her home in Ruth, Nevada she was accidently shot in the face. She says she remembers nothing about the incident until she came to in the hospital. This has necessitated a number of subsequent trips to the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City for plastic surgery and will perhaps mean others later. We wonder at times why trouble such as this should happen to so sweet a person. We do not know the answer. Only an all-seeing Providence knows the whys and wherefores of such things. Yet we know that trouble and sorrow have a place in our earthly lives and that such experiences must somehow be schoolings to give wisdom and strength and that rich blessings will follow if we learn the needed lessons - like a glorious rainbow ofttimes follows a furious storm.</p>
