  <h2 class="calibre9" id="edith-bartholomew">Edith Bartholomew</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(40) Edith Bartholomew (5), according to the record of her found in her mother’s Book of Remembrance, was born 10 Feb. 1910 in the red brick home in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, the first of her children to be born there. From this record we also learn that she was named and blessed by her uncle, Bishop Joseph Christensen, in Gunnison; baptized 2 Feb. 1919 in the Ogden Fourth Ward by Bishop L. Willard Gardner and confirmed the same day and place by Elder E. A. Olsen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We follow her as she moved with her family <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-836" title="836"></span> from Gunnison to Wyoming to Ogden and finally to Goshen, Utah. Here she was set apart at age twelve and a half, 6 Sep. 1922, as Sunday School organist, by Robert Finch, also set apart 1 Jan. 1923 as Primary organist, as well as serving as a teacher in the same organization. She finished tenth grade while living in Goshen, having previously attended school at Lyman, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Edith then attended Payson High School from which she graduated 18 May 1927. In the spring of 1931 her family moved into a new home in Payson and here she continued her church service, becoming organist of Payson Fourth Ward Sunday School as well as Ward organist. Later she became chorister of Nebo Stake Primary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Edith attended Brigham Young University and graduated there with a Bachelor of Arts degree, 4 June 1930. That fall she began teaching at Payson Junior High School and taught there four consecutive winters. In the meantime she started keeping company with a young man named Heber C. Bauer. The summer of 1933 she went with him and Dr. &amp; Mrs. Norman Osborn to attend the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago,Illinois.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She was married 22 June 1934 in the Salt Lake Temple to this same Heber Carl Bauer (b. 9 Aug. 1901 in Idaho Falls (Coltman) Idaho to Eberhardt George and Katherine Christina Hauber Bauer). A reception was held in their honor that same evening in her parents’ home in Payson. After a honeymoon in Yellowstone National Park they made their first home at 544 East 1st North in Payson. It was in Payson also that their two children, Helen and Boyd, were born, Dr. Merrill L. Oldroyd being in attendance at both births.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In May of 1940 the Bauer family moved to Glendale, Calif. and in October 1941 they moved to North Hollywood. They returned to Utah on a visit the early fall of 1943. Heber returned soon to California to look over a new employment opportunity but was stricken with polio and was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital. Edith was summoned and left the children with her parents in Payson, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-837" title="837"></span> to be at his bedside. But Heber passed away shortly afterwards, 26 Sep. 1943 and his body was returned to Payson for burial, 1 Oct. 1943.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following this sad experience Edith returned to their home in California where her brother Clifton’s wife, Rhea, stayed with her until she sold the home. She and the two children moved back to her parents’ home in Payson in Feb. 1944. She entered BYU again the spring quarter of that year, expecting to renew her teaching certificate but was encouraged to remain and work towards obtaining a Master’s Degree. She was employed there as an instructor the winter of 1945/46 and in June 1946 received her Master’s Degree. In Sep. 1947 she went to Berkeley, California, for graduate study towards her Doctor’s Degree which she finally obtained in 1956. Her professional work in education has continued at BYU to the present and she is considered “tops” in her field.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At present Edith is also a member of the National Education Foundation of the American Association of University Women (A.A.U.W.). She was nominated by the Utah Division of that board for this honored position, at which time they presented her extensive Vita, along with the following recommendation: “We feel that Dr. Edith B. Bauer’s experience as Professor of Educational Psychology at Brigham Young University, her excellent professional training, her administrative experience at BYU and in Tehran under USOM, contract #115 and her service on the Association’s International Fellowship Award committee 1962-68, eminently qualify her for the position.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dr. Bauer has held many offices in the Provo branch and was president 1961-62. She has served on the Utah Division Board as Implementation chairman in Revolution in Modern China. She understands the needs and goals of A.A.U.W. and is proud of the Education Foundation. She would like to see it expand its research facilities.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We are recommending her not only because of her professional qualifications but also because of her gracious personality, her devoted service <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-838" title="838"></span> to educational projects in her community and her long years of administrative service and teaching in religious education in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We solicit your interest and support of her, and commend to you her comprehensive Vita. Utah members of the A.A.U.W. think Dr. Edith B. Bauer would be an asset to the Educational Foundation.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon after Edith returned from her experience of teaching in Iran, she was called to serve on the General Board of the Sunday School. Shortly afterwards an article appeared in The Instructor, official magazine of the Sunday School, written by Lowell R. Jackson and entitled “Meet Your New Board Members” (abt. Nov. 1960). Edith was among those written up in this article, parts of which we quote here:- “Chatting with Dr. Edith B. Bauer is a real treat. One is immediately aware of her enthusiasm for living. She readily admits she is an optimist, but not the overactive bubbling kind who thrive on froth and the pleasure of the moment. In fact she says, ‘Life has many discouraging moments, but it would be meaningless if there weren’t some prob- lems to face and solve’.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“For those who may not have enough problems to solve - who yearn for a life of excitement and adventure - Dr. Bauer recommends a foreign mission. She returned only a short while ago from Tehran, Iran where she served two years as an advisor to the education program at the University of Tehran. ‘When I made my final decision to go to Iran and began packing’, she recalls, ‘I became very apprehensive. This feeling grew worse as we stopped for an emergency fueling at Gander, Newfoundland - there was a heavy storm over the Atlantic. And by the time I got to Istanbul (Con- stantinople) this feeling reached a new high. Imagine, late in the evening, being surrounded by strange dialects, sights and smells. I felt so helpless to it all - as though I were at the end of the earth. Then, to top it all, someone said Tehran was even more remote.’</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“But Sister Bauer found a friendly group of people at the airport in Tehran to welcome her (a custom there); there was an LDS branch in the city; comfortable accomodations were found for herself, her son and Dr. Reichert, the other woman technician from Utah; the climate and mountain terrain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-842" title="842"></span> bore close similarity to those in Utah; and the Persian Gardens were beyond her expectations in their exotic beauty. Needless to say, Dr. Bauer also found many problems and challenges during her eventful stay in Iran. But then, she had encountered many of these in her earlier life. One of them was adjusting to new places.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Her most crushing and challenging problem was that of adjusting to the sudden death of her husband, Heber Carl Bauer, in the fall of 1943. For a time, little other than the need to care for her two young children seemed important. However, from these experiences has developed an increased appreciation for her parents, her children and friends, and a greater faith in God,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Edith has served the church in various capacities since her first assignment of being Sunday School organist at age 12. She has had teaching experiences in all the auxiliary organizations of the church. She has been Primary president and Stake Board member, Ward YWMIA president and Stake Board member, Ward chorister and organist, Coordinator for the Junior Sunday School and teacher-trainer director.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this present writing Edith is living alone. Her children, Helen (Kimball) a graduate of BYU and a registered nurse lives in California, and her son, Boyd, a specialist in Asian affairs and a candidate for a PhD at American University, Washington D. C., lives in Illinois. Another special honor has just come to Edith, for the Utah Division of the American Association of University Women presented its “Distinguished Woman, 1969,” award to her at a banquet 19 Apr. 1969 in Salt Lake City.</p>
