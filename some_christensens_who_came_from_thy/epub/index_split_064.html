  <p class="calibre1">(18) Edgar Dee Bartholomew (5) was born 21 Aug. 1903 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. His mother wrote a history of him and placed it in her Book of Remembrance from which we quote:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Edgar was blessed by his paternal grandfather, Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Oct. 1903 in the red stone church in Fayette. His grandmother Christensen took him to the Manti Temple 5 Sep. 1911 where he was baptized a member of the LDS church by Quincy G. Crawford and confirmed the same day and place by Nils O. Anderson Jr. He was ordained a Deacon in Gunnison, Utah 7 Nov. 1915 by Adolph Peterson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Edgar’s family moved from Fayette to Gunnison the spring of 1907, when he was nearly four. His father bought a fine red brick house there from Lafe Bown. Edgar started grade school in Gunnison, beginning in the fall of 1909 when he was six and continuing each school year until the spring of 1916 when he was going on thirteen. The red brick house was sold to his Uncle Arthur Christensen and he and his mother and brothers and sisters moved into Uncle Arthur’s old house in southwest Gunnison, once owned by Uncle Chris. This was in the late fall of 1915.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“On 27 Mar. 1916 Edgar, together with his mother and brothers and sisters and also his Uncle Louis Christensen’s family left Gunnison by train for Lyman, Wyoming, from where they moved onto a homestead about six miles east of Lyman, which had been taken up by their mother. Here the family lived and worked in summers and moved to Lyman in winters where the children could attend school. Edgar must have finished grade school there.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In the spring of 1918 his family moved to Ogden, Utah, where his father had bought a nice new home in the Fourth Ward. Edgar attended school that winter in Ogden. He was ordained a Teacher in the LDS priesthood 1 Apr. 1919 by <span id="page-746"></span> Hyrum E. Lund. The family moved back to Lyman, Wyoming that spring and lived for another year. Edgar again attended school in Lyman.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The spring of 1920 his family moved to Goshen, Utah, on the Robert Boswell farm. Edgar helped his father on the farm. He loved to ride horses and became very proficient in that, soon taking part in rodeos. He was also interested in electrical work. He got a job with the Phoenix utility line, working from Santaquin to Eureka under Superintendent Whipple, and enjoying the work continued in that occupation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In 1928 he worked in Chicago, Illinois and then in northern Texas for Texas Power and Light Company. Then he worked in Merida, Yucatan and then in Mexico for awhile, returning to Utah in September 1930. He started work for the Tintic Standard Mining Co. at Dividend, Utah, and worked there during 1934/35. In 1936 he went east and worked in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. During World War II he worked in the shipyards. From there he went to Louisiana and Mississippi, working for Stone and Webster Electrical Co. He then went to work for an electrical company in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, from where he was called to Little Rock, Arkansas to supervise some electrical construction lines going out of that area.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“1 May 1953 Edgar returned to Utah and went to Moab and worked in the uranium business until Jan. 1954 when he went to Salt Lake City to have surgery for the removal of a cataract from his right eye, by Drs. Palmer and Quinn. (During his recovery his father passed away, 6 Mar. 1954.) After two months rest he returned to work at Moab but had to quit again for surgery on his left eye. A cataract was removed from that eye 11 Jan. 1956 by the same doctors who took care of the right eye. Both eye operations were successful. While recovering from the second he had some improvements made at the family home in Payson, where he lived with his mother whenever he was in the area - a new gas furnace and water heater and an Admiral color TV installed. When fully recovered, Edgar returned to Moab where he was interested in some uranium claims, returning to Payson from <span id="page-747"></span> time to time to look after the needs and interests of his mother.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the death of his mother in June 1964, and after the family home was sold, Edgar returned to Moab, Utah to make his permanent home. During 1966 he built himself a large boat to sail on the Green River there. He also owns a large trailer house in which he lives, and some uranium claims. He enjoys life, working his claims, prospecting, fishing, boating, and has become a typical “rock hound”. He is unmarried at the present time (1969) and has no descendants.</p>
