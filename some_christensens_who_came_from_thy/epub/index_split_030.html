  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else, freed from most of the responsibilities of their big family, began to go more often to the temple. Else had kept up a fitful correspondence with her kinfolk in Denmark since her return from there and Laurs had written to them also. He liked to write letters much better than Else and was a good penman. In spite of the fact that they usually requested some genealogical information when they wrote, little came back to them. Andrew had brought back some bits of data gleaned while he was there but it was little enough. The urge to know more of their relatives, especially their dead, was always with them. The death of an aunt here - an uncle there - a cousin married - a niece or nephew born - everything of the sort was set down quickly in their joint Temple Record Book as a source and reminder of future work to be taken care of in the temples of the Most High. Only those who have truly experienced the Spirit of Elijah can appreciate what these records of their kindred meant to them. The first part of the year 1907 they had spent a great deal of time in the Manti Temple finishing the ordinance work for all of their dead whose records they had. Temple work was the work to which they both now wished to dedicate the remainder of their lives, aside from the precious time they would spend with their ever-increasing offspring.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They didn’t remain living in Gunnison long enough to enjoy good spring water tapped into their home there, nor did they stay long enough to have a telephone put in. According to the early Gunnison Ward records their church memberships were removed to Manti, Utah 15 Feb. 1909. It seems, however, that before settling in Manti they spent some time living in Salt Lake City and working in the temple there, perhaps at their son Andrew’s suggestion, since he and his family were living there then. It has been said that they lived some west of the temple down below the viaduct at the time. Eventually, however, they settled in Manti in a fair sized adobe house on the corner of<span id="page-376"></span> what is now First North and First East streets. Besides the house there was a barn on the place with room for a horse and a cow or two, also plenty of room for a few pigs, lambs, chickens, geese, a garden and some berry bushes on the lot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But then a plan was born - or perhaps it came to mind while they were rummaging through their important papers earlier, preparing to move. Could it have been that Laurs happened upon his blessing given him in Christenburg in 1884 and took time to re-read it? Likely. Much that had been promised him at the time had come to pass and much was promised for the distant future. “Ja, Ja, all this is wonderful and fine,” he must have thought… “Your life shall be spared long upon the earth”… “Ja, Ja!” But it was the part that came next that must have bothered him and set his mind working on it… “The still small voice will say to you - ‘Go back to your native land where you shall bear witness of the Gospel for your relatives and friends, both the high and the low. You shall do many works in their midst, as the Angels of the Lord shall prepare the way and the wisdom of the Holy Ghost be given you…” Now how could he himself just ignore this part of his blessing and expect the continued blessings of heaven?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else must have readily agreed that Laurs should return to the Old Country and also that she herself should return with him, since she still had so little of her own genealogy. There would never again be a better time for them for they were not getting any younger! But what about money? They would talk to the boys, perhaps some of them could help a little with that since most were doing well. And perhaps Louis and Florence would buy their Gunnison place instead of just renting it as they were doing. Vena could of course stay with Emma, who was so in need of help now. Thus Laurs and Else had talked and planned and the immediate future took on a glow of anticipation. But when they spoke to Andrew about it he encouraged them to wait<span id="page-377"></span> yet another year, for he had also been making plans to return to Europe and take up the studies that had been interrupted by Adelbert’s death. This time he wanted to take his family along, and it would be better to wait until their new little daughter, Elsie Eliza, was a little older and thus better able to travel. If they themselves would wait another year, they could all go over together!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs and Else pondered Andrew’s advice and decided to wait. Then Else wrote the exciting news to her loved ones in Jutland, for she could not keep it, and Laurs wrote to them also and to his brother Christen. — Oh that they two should meet once again in this life! It didn’t take long at all for letters to come back from some of Else’s loved ones, all in the same envelope, and she and Laurs read them aloud to each other in Danish, as they were written, and rejoiced for they knew they would see the writers in person ‘ere long. Following are translations of these letters:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thorsted, Denmark 15 April 1909</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear sister and family:—</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thank you very much for your letter, it was a great joy to all of us. But I will admit that I feel a little ashamed because I haven’t written for so long. I have often thought about it. Yes, dear sister, I, like you, pray for us Old Ones and the Young Ones too and thank the good Lord our Father for all his gracious gifts to us. It is almost more than I can believe that you can take that long journey again, but may it be a successful one and know that here will be joy and that we will take care of you as well as we can. We still live in our home. Mikkel is well and can go about both home and outside and the same is true of me. We have Frederick, Maren and Holger home and those who are out are doing fine too. We don’t have as many grandchildren as you but we only have two who are married so it is understandable that we are in lesser number. Jens has nine healthy children and Kristian one who is two years old. Yes, when you get to Thorsted you can visit all of your family. Sister Marie and brother Lars are fine but I guess they will write. I am sending a view of sister <span id="page-378"></span> Stine’s home at the time Anders was here in Denmark. He visited Svend and Stine in Vinding by Vejle. As you know their daughter Signe was married to the Principal of the High School, but he died last summer so she sold the school and has bought our old house. Svend was here in March to buy a piece of land. We expect him any day now. He will build their new house himself you know. Stine will stay at Signe’s place till the house is finished. Svend shall then stay with us in the meantime. Their lot is not more than five minutes walk from our house so believe me Stine and I are looking forward to living so close to each other. Dear sister, we don’t have much to complain about reading your writing but it may be hard for you to read mine. You said that it was the time for sowing when you wrote. Here it is different for after having a mild winter now we have had three days of heavy snowing and today the men have been out shoveling snow to get the road passable. This is something none of us ever remember having happened before right in the middle of April - but it will do much good anyway. It is good to have a sure leader to trust in so we have reason to be happy children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Yes, dear friends, I must close for it is always a hard task for me to write and for that I am sorry since there is an old saying which goes, ‘If you make me happy you make me good’, and I know we can make each other happy by writing. But when we meet and talk together that will be even better. Tell Anders Hello for us Old Ones and the Young Ones too. Those were happy days we had when he was here. Yes, how time goes by - it is now five years ago soon. But how happy we are for your picture. We have to search long to find a family as big and nice as this one! With this I will say goodby and God’s peace with us all, your Sister - Karen.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Relatives Far Away:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Mother has now written and asks me to send a little greeting too. I thought that she probably had told everything so that there was no news left for me to tell. It is too bad that my dear cousin<span id="page-379"></span> Elvena cannot read my letters for then it would be her rather than you that I wrote to. Dear Aunt, if it really should come true that you will visit us next summer how happy we will be! We will treat you as good as we can in every way - but cannot cousin Elvena come with you? I think it would be nice for you too if she did and we would look forward to that very much. You write that she just turned twenty-two. I turned twenty-five on the second of April. This must be the time we celebrate birthdays. Tell dear, good Anders ‘hello’ for us many times and congratulate him on his little children. Wasn’t it his oldest son who passed away? Dear friends, if it just hadn’t been so far between us then maybe there could have been a possibility for me to visit you for I still have a desire to get out, really out and try and see what I can amount to. Maybe my opportunity will come someday. Mother is well - she can do things herself. Father will turn seventy-four on the first of September. He has good health too so I should really take the opportunity to get away now. Receive, all of you, the most loving greetings from your niece and cousin - Maren Skaarup.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tornely, Den. 17 Apr. 1909”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Aunt Else:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Now that mother is planning on writing you I would like to send along some word too. Yes, you must come next summer for sure, and couldn’t Elvena come too? You say that you are thinking of letting your son Louis have your home in Gunnison, then I guess Elvena could come with you and you could close the house you have now. Uncle Svend’s family is up here in Thy now. As you know, they are going to live out at Thorsted. I have been working in an embroidery shop in Thisted for fifteen months. I finished my apprenticeship in January and have been working for wages since. I shall now, this May, go to Salling High School for the months of May, June and July as a student and to help with sewing classes at the school. The pay is 40 Kr. besides the tuition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There is going to be a big Festival in Aarhus this summer which will start in May. It said in<span id="page-380"></span> the paper about a month ago that they would have to work both nights and holidays to get ready by then. Be sure and tell Anders “hello’ for me. Maybe he can hardly remember me as you know I was small and not yet confirmed when he was here. I am now a good sixteen years old. I guess I will write the return address on the letter as plainly as I can. I am enclosing a picture of myself which I would like cousin Elvena to have - it is the last I had taken. I am sewing much so I shall have all my clothes ready for school as we been unable to get a serving girl. Mother tells me so often about Aunt Else so I know you well although I have never seen you. Now I will close with many greetings of love to all the many cousins but mostly to Elvena, Anders and you two dear Old Ones. From your niece, Edel Christensen. Tornely, Thisted, Denmark.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Sister Else, husband and children:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Now that my daughter Edel has written such a long letter I will just add thanks for your letter which we were so happy to receive and for the hope it awakened in us of seeing you again once more in this life. Yes dear sister, we would all be so happy if you and your husband would risk the trip again. I guess it is I now who am the Old One for I am not very well as my weight is so high. I am 200 lbs. and my legs are bad since I suffer from vericose veins. However summer is the best time for me. Tell Anders ‘Hello’, we all remember him with great warmth. Tell all of your other loved ones and your husband the same also but receive for yourself a big and loving greeting from my husband and me - Marie.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As it turned out Laurs and Else were probably thankful that they had waited and not gone back to the land of their ancestors that year, for it was a period of birth and deaths, happiness and sorrowing for members of their family and they were on hand to share in both. It started out in February of that year when Arthur, a twin himself, was presented with twin girls by his wife Millie. But let the oldest of these, Cousin Grace, tell the story:—<span id="page-381"></span> “Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging kerosine lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me, for I was there and heard the bang! Our parents were proud and happy with their enlarged family - four children under the age of four. Then too, the way things happened was quite the talk around town. I was born about twenty minutes before midnight on Feb. 16th 1909 and Gladys was born about twenty minutes after midnight on Feb. 17th - twins born on different days. This was quite a drain on mother’s health and so it was decided that Aunt Vena Christensen should take me and Aunt Mary Gledhill should take Gladys, until mother regained her strength.” Aunt Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) now well past eighty, continues the story:— “When Grace and Gladys were born Grace, a large blond Christensen baby, came first, not long before midnight. About two hours later, not long after midnight, Gladys, a tiny, sickly, dark complexioned baby that looked like the Gledhills, came. Millie, in her hysteria, refused to own the second baby. Dr. Hagan put her in my charge - they didn’t expect the little thing to live. I cared for Gladys in my room at home where I fed her with an eye dropper for two weeks, a mixture of whisky and something else the doctor put with it, which probably helped to save her life.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though Dr. Hagan delivered the majority of babies now in Gunnison, you could bet if a new one was arriving at any of the Christensen’s homes, either grandmother Else K., Aunt Vena or both would be right there to help out, before and after. And a number of other babies were expected by the Christensens within the year. Arthur’s and Millie’s twins weren’t a dozen days old when Joseph and Roxie had another child at their place, the seventh, but only the fourth to live. This one was a big, long, hungry baby and Roxie had far too little milk to satisfy him. So every few hours someone took him over to his Aunt Millie’s for an extra breast nursing, since she had plenty for the twins and some to spare for Virgil. Not to be outdone then, Chris and Caroline brought forth their seventh child and third son, Farrald, the very first part of that September. And a month<span id="page-382"></span> and a few days after Farrald arrived, Louis and Florence had their fifth child, the first baby to be born in the old Gunnison homestead since Vena, as far as we know. Little brown-eyed Dale helped to compensate for the loss of baby Spencer, who had been laid away by Louis and Florence some seventeen months earlier. Thus five more grandchildren were quickly added to Laurs’ and Else’s posterity - jewels in their crowns! Else K. at least was most likely present to greet each one on arrival.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But - “The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away… ” On Sat. 18 Dec. 1909 Elsie’s and Alma’s little son Byard died. He was then a beautiful child of four years nine months and sixteen days, but had always had an incurable heart condition. Alma was on the desert with the sheep at the time and Elsie was expecting again soon. She and grandmother were alone with the little one when he passed away. His burial was delayed until Alma could be notified and return to Gunnison. On Wednesday afternoon, two days before Christmas, a brief funeral service was held at the residence. Thus over a happy home the shadow of a little grave fell. But exactly seven weeks later Elsie had a beautiful baby girl to fill her empty arms. This Edith was so welcome, not alone because of her little brother’s passing but also because she was the first daughter, following four sons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Emma and Charles had also known much sorrow in the past two years, having lost two baby daughters in stillbirth, one right after the other. Neither were named. Their oldest daughter Ada, though quite young at the time, says she distinctly remembers the last of these little ones in her box-casket lying there perfectly formed like a beautiful doll. She just couldn’t understand why this baby sister wouldn’t wake up - she so much wanted a little sister to play with for she had only Byron. Charles buried each of the little corpses on their ranch there, across the wash some distance from the house. But then Ada got a real live sister when Emma gave birth to a healthy baby girl, 13 Jan. 1910, who later received the name Imelda. <span id="page-383"></span> A few years before, Andrew and Sarah had purchased a lovely home in Salt Lake City on 27th South and 9th East. The story went that it had been built by President John Taylor, so Edythe says, and she continues:— “The house was of brick, with an artistic front porch and roof from which jutted dormer windows. The glass of the front parlor window was of good dimension with an upper panel of colored glass. The home was of two stories. A couple of the upstairs bedrooms had windows facing the west from which we could watch the sunsets with their colored reflections upon Great Salt Lake, as well as the snow-capped mountains of the Ochre (Oquirrh?) range in winters. The annual fireworks displays of old Wandemere Park were exciting delights on July Fourth and Twenty-Fourth nights. It was like having reserved seats to the very best shows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The grounds were extensive. Many homes have since been built upon the area that was then our lot. Fruit trees of all varieties, raspberries, strawberries, and different kinds of currants grew abundantly. There was much garden space. The property even boasted a windmill but this father took down to avoid the danger of having it crash onto the roof in a strong wind. A big stream of water gushed from a pipe on the property, but whether its source was from a spring or an artesian well I do not know. Father envisioned our own fish pond and proceeded to have one excavated, lined with cement and stocked with an abundance of trout. It was later protected with a high mesh fence when the second daughter of the family, Elsie Eliza, came along; for from the time she could toddle she was fascinated with this pond. The fence had a padlocked gate to permit easy entrance to the pond when necessary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Sometime later, in fact Friday 8 April 1910, my two younger brothers and I were hard bent on ‘jumping the rope’. It was the rage at school and Wendell and I hoped to perfect our form. We were down in the orchard some distance from the house. Mother had commissioned us to watch out for seventeen-month-old Elsie who had also come out of doors to play, but was not with us. We had<span id="page-384"></span> looked toward the fish pond and the gate appeared closed so we looked no further. After a time mother called from the back door, “Have you seen Elsie?” The rope was thrown down and we scattered to search. I reached the pond. The gate was now ajar, apparently it had been pushed closed but not locked. There, peacefully floating on the water, baby face to the sky was our little sister. I was quickened and stunned by remorse - why hadn’t I gone out to the gate and really checked - why hadn’t I watched more closely and kept the baby with us? I wrestled with myself and even yet, after all these years, I feel responsible for that tragedy. A small funeral service was held in our parlor a few days later and Elsie was buried in the family plot at the Provo City Cemetery beside our brother Adelbert. I never ‘jumped the rope’ again, nor could I even bear to watch the school groups jumping the rest of that spring.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nevertheless this was not the end of the grief for the Christensens. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We, Albert and Jennie and family, lived in the John Maiben home in Manti which we were renting while our new house was being finished, our old one having been sold. Elaine and I had just returned from Sunday School, it being Sunday 22 May 1910. We found mother in the parlor, accompanying herself on the organ and singing that very old hymn, “Who are those arrayed in white, brighter than the noonday sun…” At least these were the words she was singing, if not the title of the song. Father was out of town on court business. A messenger came to the door - Father was wanted on the community telephone, long distance. Mother went to take the call - she seemed worried. She came back in a few minutes, tears streaming down her face. Cousin Orilla, Chris’ and Caroline’s daughter Elaine’s age had just passed away with scarlet fever. Others of their children were down sick with it also. The funeral would not be held until they could get word to Uncle Chris who was up on “The Weber”. They would let us know later. Five days after, Friday 27 May, about the same time of day as Sunday, mother was again seated at the organ playing and singing “Who are those arrayed in white…”, when a girl from the<span id="page-385"></span> telephone office came the second time to call mother to the telephone - long distance. “It must be word about the funeral” she said as she went out. Soon she returned almost beside herself with weeping. “Poor Chris - poor Caroline”, I remember her sobbing; “Elora too has passed away with scarlet fever!”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Uncle Chris returned home just before Elora died but there had been nothing he or anyone else could do to save her. Joint funeral services were planned for the two sweet little girls, and since the family was in quarantine for this dreaded disease, as were numerous other families in the town, the services were held outside in front of the Christensen residence. Pearl remembers that her two younger sisters were dressed all in white for their burials and that for the funeral their caskets were lifted outside and propped up on one end so that the beautiful corpses, thirteen year old Elora with her long, waist-length blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, and seven-and- a-half year old Orilla with her golden curls, could be more easily viewed by the mourners on the sidewalk. Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) remembers that the neighbor children and young people, herself among them, gathered and sat on the ditchbank across the road north to watch the sad proceedings, for these lovely girls had been friends of theirs. All were weeping.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There is no death The stars go down to rise upon a brighter shore And bright in heaven’s jeweled crown They shine forevermore.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">—Anon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Life is so uncertain - and best laid plans can go awry. Yet throughout the maze of births and sorrowful, unexpected deaths, Laurs and Else kept alive the hope of going back to Old Denmark. Now the time was fast approaching when they had hoped to join their loved ones there - and for this they fervently prayed. But would all that had happened put a damper on it? Would little Elsie Eliza’s death change Andrew’s and Sarah’s plans? Encouraging letters came again from Else’s people<span id="page-386"></span> and apparently they too were looking forward with hope for their visit to Denmark: —</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Tornely, Apr. 10, 1910 “Dear Sister with Husband and Children:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much for your long, loving letter and the pictures. Everything was received in good order. I was so amazed at the cover and everything - even the little string was so fun. To think that you dear sister had tied around it all! Yes, I can surely see that you have lost weight, but believe me I am far from a small thing - so big and fat! But I can move and if I didn’t have these difficult legs I could tumble around well yet, but they are whole even if they are tired of the big weight and vein knots. Otherwise I am fine and healthy if I can just avoid cold weather. So I would rather move into the city to live and get rid of the garden. My husband is striving with it at this time, planting potatoes, carrots, chervil, radishes, peas and onions. We are behind compared to you but they go along too, those who are behind. Yes, we would be so happy to see you so come as soon as you can! Now you can visit all four of us in one day. Svend and family live in a nice house in Thorsted. He will also put in a garden. I believe that sister Karen and Mikkel are thinking of giving the farm to some of their children but it won’t likely be until next spring. Brother Mads’ wife Else has been sick again this winter with stomach trouble and a weak lung. She is up a little now but looks terrible. They have their Edel at home but this May their daughter Marie is coming home from Sjaelland where she has been for many years, then Edel will go to High School.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I guess my Edel will write you. She is home this month but is leaving again in May. She would be glad if she could see the much-talked-of Aunt Else. When she was younger she wanted to go over to see you she said. Now that the family have all seen your letter we will begin to answer so that you shall not miss getting word before you leave. Edel will write, and here with the most loving greetings to you, Christian, Anders and everybody, am I, Your sister, Marie Christensen”<span id="page-387"></span> “Dear Sister:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“As I am staying with sister Marie at present, I will send you our greetings too as I don’t think we will get to send a letter this time. At this time of year Svend is quite busy and he is taking a trip in a few days. But I can tell you that we are fine and really happy at the thoughts of seeing you dear ones, especially from so far away. Yes, if you just do come to Denmark once more! Loving greetings, your sister, Anne Kirstine (Stine)”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Thorsted, Denmark 15 April 1910</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear friends in the distance:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To you dear sister, first we shall say thanks for your long letter. It is delightful hearing from you but when we have the wonderful joy of seeing you then will it be much more delightful. I can tell you that we are all well and have it good. Mikkel is still running the farm but it probably will be only one more year. He’ll shortly be an old man for in September he will be seventy-five. But he is well and he gets around, away and at home, and that do we all. So we have so much to thank the good God Father for - yes his grace for us is more than we can comprehend. I know to begin with that I won’t write as long a letter as you, dear sister. Brother Mads’ wife is very sick and has been that way for a long time so we don’t know if she is going to be here very long. But it all stands in God Father’s hands, and since they rely on this it shouldn’t be as hard on us friends as long as what happens is God’s will. We have sent your letter back to Marie so don’t have your new address but hope your old one will find you. I am supposed to say ‘hello’ from Svend and Stine, we are happy that they came to Thorsted. I will close with many loving greetings to you all. Mikkel and Karen Skaarup. “</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Torneley, Denmark 17 Apr. 1910.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Aunt and whole family:<span id="page-388"></span> “At last I grab the pen and write. We had a sewing girl here last week and so I helped and have been so busy. I have had sewn some underclothing and a national costume. Of dresses and over-clothes I shall have nothing new since I was so well supplied last Spring. I am going to High School again this summer. Vallo High School is the one I will attend and O. P. Jensen is the name of the director. It begins the fourth of May. I will teach handwork and gymnastics and take instruction in the remaining subjects. The school will be in session until August. Then I’m really going to start working, for if everything goes as we have figured, I will begin the middle of August at Silkeborg Seminary where I will have to go for four years to get my teacher’s examination (degree). I have a tremendous desire to do this and father and mother have their hopes in me too. But father is getting old and will soon be seventy-four and that’s really up in the years. However it is his greatest desire that I’ll make something of myself - I am of course his baby girl.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“If you come this summer can’t you make it so that you will be here in August? I would like to be here while you are here. When Anders and his wife come to Europe we hope they will also come to Denmark’s land. Thanks for the pictures. Mother let so many see Elvena’s picture that when I got hold of it it was almost black. When she is photographed again I would put a great price on receiving a copy. But if she would come over here with it herself it would be all the more dearly come by. Elvena should not be afraid to come over here, when I get enough money there would be nothing I’d rather do than come over and visit my family in America. But it would only be for a visit as I could never leave our good Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I have to go in a little bit and that’s why my writing is so choppy. But of course you’ll forgive it for herewith is sent to the whole family best wishes from the inhabitants in Tornely, by your devoted - Edel Christensen.”</p>
