  <p class="calibre1">Among the many other Saints who had joined the Christensens and Myrups for this journey to Zion was a young Dane of some fifteen years named Andrew Jenson. He and his parents and brother came from the little city of Saeby in the Vendsyssel Conference. Andrew, fortunately, kept a day-by-day account of the trip, and to him we are indebted for a substantial part of the information included in this chapter. Brother Jenson later became Assistant Historian of the LDS Church and traveled widely in Scandinavia and elsewhere, collecting historical information for the Church. He wrote several volumes and it is from two of these, “History of the Scandinavian Mission” and “Autobiography of Andrew Jenson” that we have gleaned much about the journey of this company of Saints to Zion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The day was fine and the sea calm and they enjoyed sailing over the broad face of the Cattegate, but as the vessel heaved, some of the emigrants experienced seasickness. At daybreak, May 17th, they passed the town of Helsinger (Elsinore) and at 6:00 o’clock a.m. arrived <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-176" title="176"></span>safely in the city of Copenhagen, the Capitol of Denmark. One of the Elders led the way from the landing stage to a hall which had been rented for the purpose, and there most of the emigrants spent several hours. Some, however, were too deeply interested in the grandeur of the city to remain quietly in one place and walked all around, promenading on the ramparts, visiting the principal squares and churches and enjoying themselves immensely. This was the largest city most of the emigrants from Jutland had ever seen, Copenhagen at that time had about 180,000 inhabitants. (Now with its Suburbs, it has over a million and is considered one of the finest and best governed cities in the world.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here the emigrants from the Aalborg and Vendsyssel Conferences were united with emigrating Saints from the other Danish Conferences, and at 1:00 o’clock p.m. they sailed from Copenhagen on board the steamship “Aurora”, which was to take them to Keil in Holstein. The voyage along the coasts of Zealand and “Møens Klint” a hill of chalk formation which rose abruptly from the sea 450 feet. The weather was pleasant and the sea undisturbed. Joy and happiness reigned supreme on board; most of the Saints seemed delighted with the prospects before them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sailing along on the blue Baltic Sea the Danish emigrants soon saw the last of their “Lovely Land” with her green, green islands, for day and night drew together and dark covered all, and when the light of the morning of May 18th came they had reached “Kieler Fjord” off the coast of Holstein, Germany. Sailing up the Fjord they soon reached the city of Keil where they landed and tarried several hours in the fine waiting room at the railroad station. Here again the more venturesome took off to stretch their legs and visit different parts of this city with its beautiful parks and gardens. Keil (now an important seaport of Germany) was then an attractive city of about 30,000 inhabitants. It was situated in a fertile district of the country on a fjord, which was one of the safest harbors on the Baltic.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-177" title="177"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">At 12:00 o’clock noon they were all seated in railway cars and left for Altona, about seventy miles distance, where they arrived after three hours pleasant journey through the green and beautiful Holstein. This was the first railroad ride for the majority of the emigrants, railroad building having been commenced in parts of Denmark only a few years previous to 1866. From Altona they all marched down the hill to the banks of the river Elbe, where the women and children boarded a little steamer and went by water, while the men walked a mile or so through a part of Altona into the city of Hamburg where they were all lodged in an emigration house to enjoy a comfortable nights rest. Again the spark of restless Viking blood in their veins took a number on another exploration jaunt and they walked miles through the great city of Hamburg before retiring. All spoke German here, which few of the emigrants understood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Getting everyone on and off conveyances so many times took real good managing, and it was with thanksgiving that they now faced the last of it, for a time at least. On Saturday, May 19, 1866, they went on board the double-decked packet ship “Kenilworth” (a sailing vessel with Capt. Brown in charge). This ship lay at anchor a short distance from the dock in the river Elbe. This was an old English sailing vessel which had been chartered by the Church on easy terms. It was ordinarily used for hauling coal, etc. and was not intended for passenger traffic. But it had been fitted up on this occasion with bunks and other conveniences on both decks for the comfort of the passengers. At the time steamships were in common use for ocean travel but the cost to emigrants for such luxury was prohibitive, so this sailing vessel had been engaged.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The next day, which was Whitsunday (May 20th) was spent in locating the emigrants in different parts of the ship and showing each family its bunk. From their anchorage in the Elbe they had a fine view of the surroundings, the cities of Hamburg and Altona on the north and the low and flat country (Hannover) on the south. On the 21st <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-178" title="178"></span>a meeting was held on the middle deck of the ship where the Elders in charge gave instructions in regards to cleanliness, order and decorum. On Tuesday, May 22, more emigrants, together with Elders Carl Winderborg, Niels Wilhelmsen, Geo. M. Brown and Christian Christiansen, arrived in Hamburg and were taken on board. This increased the number of emigrants on the Kenilworth to 684 souls, besides the ship’s crew; of these 583 were from Denmark, 23 from Norway, 73 from Sweden and 5 from Germany.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The next day (May 23rd) the Kenilworth left her moorings and was towed by two small tugs a short distance below Altona (where other supplies were taken on, including barrels of fresh water). On the 24th President Carl Winderborg and Elders Wilhelmsen and Christiansen came on board and organized the company for traveling, appointing Samuel L. Sprague as president or leader with Morten Lund as his assistant. Fred R.E. Berthelsen was appointed secretary and Ole H. Berg captain of the guard. The emigrants were divided into 42 messes or districts containing from twelve to seventeen persons apiece, with a president over each whose duty it was to receive provisions and distribute them to the various families and individuals in his district; also to preside over prayers night and morning for his respective group as well as watch over each of those under his jurisdiction and see that all rules of cleanliness and order, etc., were strictly obeyed. (We can easily imagine that it was Elder Lars Myrup who would have been placed in charge of the group which included the Christensens from Kobberod.) On the same occassion the ship was dedicated by President Carl Winderborg and the prediction made that it should carry its precious cargo of souls safe and well to the “Land of Promise”. Timely and valuable instructions were imparted by the bretheren and the emigrants were enjoined to yield strict obedience to the brethern who had been appointed to preside.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, May 25, 1866, a little after noon, the ships anchor was lifted and the Kenilworth was towed down the river Elbe and at 9:00 P.M. sailed past cuxhaven at it’s mouth and was soon far out<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-179" title="179"></span> on the broad face of the North Sea. The weather was pleasant, the sea quiet, and the commencement of the voyage promising. Most of the Saintson board were in high spirits. (Two other companies of Saints from the Scandinavian countries sailed from Hamburg a few days later, in the ships “Humbolt” and “Cavour”, making the total number of emigrants from the Scandinavian Mission 1,213 in 1866.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Saturday, 26 May, the wind was favorable and the old ship sped on her way swiftly. Some passengers engaged in dancing on the upper deck. The route was to be north around Scotland for although this was a longer way than the usual route through the English Channel which most emigrant ships leaving continental Europe chose yet it made it possible to avoid any excessive heat. On Monday 28 May heavy winds arose on the North Sea and drove them off their course far to the eastward and so close to the west coast of Norway that its rocky cliffs could be plainly seen, They encountered several showers of hail in this area. Due to the tossing and rocking of the vessel in the strong winds most of the passengers suffered more or less from seasickness. In the afternoon of June lst, having gotten back on her course, the ship passed the Shetland and Orkney Islands lying north of Scotland and before night were on the somewhat turbulent waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The winds had turned favorable again, however, and there was comparatively smooth sailing for about two weeks.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By this time most of the emigrants had gotten used to life on the ocean waves. They were well organized and willingly submitted to the discipline and regulations which had been agreed upon. Thus at 6:00 o’clock each morning they arose at the signal of the bugle, attended to absolutions and then engaged in prayer in the different districts at 8:00 o’clock. Then they ate breakfast, which consisted of tea and rye bread in the beginning but after all the bread had been consumed they feasted on sea biscuits which were made of rye, wheat and oatmeal. Their food was prepared and cooked in a large kitchen from which it was<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-180" title="180"></span> brought and distributed by the various group presidents in charge. At 11:30 A.M. they had dinner, which generally consisted of good, solid food. After that they frequently amused themselves in dancing or engaged in diverse games on the upper deck in order to keep up good cheer and counteract the tediousness of the long voyage. Thus the days for most passed quickly and pleasantly. At 6:00 P.M. they had supper and at 9:00 o’clock they were supposed to retire for the night after having had prayers at 8:00 o’clock. Cleanliness and order were strictly observed and all who were able to do so were required to spend a good part of their time on the upper deck to enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Meetings were usually held on Sundays and other occasions, at which powerful testimonies were borne and timely instructions given as circumstances demanded. A number of marriages were solemnized on which occasions they generally indulged in pleasantries, dancing and speechmaking. Even a manuscript paper was issued almost daily, which introduced humorous and spicy articles suitable for the life they led.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Guard was kept up all night and all the brethren who were of proper age and able took turns. The captain and the crew were gentlemanly in their deportment towards the passengers and treated them in a kind and respectful manner, allowing them all the privileges that could reasonably be expected, and the sick received very good attention. However, although the food and provisions were satisfactory enough, the passengers had difficulty with the cook, a hot-headed and disagreeable person who quarrelled with several of the brethren, especially on one occasion when a fight was barely averted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Likely much of the conversation those days on board was about the “Restored Church” and the “Land of Zion” for these sincere people must have felt it a wonderful blessing that the true Church of Christ, which had been lost because of the wickedness of men, had been brought back to the earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith in their day. And here they were, many of them after years of yearning, planning and scrimping, going to Zion and the<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-181" title="181"></span>Rocky Mountains which, the good Lord willing, they would all see before that year’s ending. Could we have listened in and interpreted the Scandinavian tongue we might have heard something like this:—“Those plates of gold, dug up from a hillside in America, told of old times there just like the old stories written on runic stones in Denmark.”—“Ja, ja, I saw such a stone once, a peasant ran into it after a rain when he was plowing a field.”—“America seems very new to us but it is as old as the world.”—“Ja, the Book of Mormon itself tells the story of the red Indians who lived there long before Columbus sailed the seas, and about their religion and their ways, just as we have learned about Denmark and the Vikings in old times.”—“There are still Indians in Zion now and on the warpath they say. ‘Tis a sure thing we’ll see some before we’re through!”—“Joseph Smith, the Prophet himself, shot in a prison, tumbling through a window to die bravely lying at the base of it in a pool of his own blood.”—“Nej, the Prophet Joseph is not really dead, any more than Christ is; though he was murdered, his spirit seemed to come alive again in the carpenter and Prophet Brigham Young whom, if we are lucky, we shall all see in Zion.”—“Ja, Brigham Young was the one who led the Saints far from the persecutions of their enemies across deserts and mountains, the same way we will go to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake where the Saints are building a great city of their own.”—“Ja, ja, and not only one valley but many,why all of Denmark could beset down in the middle of that place they have there and not be even noticed!” And so the talk must have gone for, once they were caught up in the spirit and wonder of the Gospel, they could go on and on just like the Restored Church had gone on even after its Prophet had been murdered. And surely none of those faithful Saints doubted but that in America, whose deserts were to blossom as the rose, they themselves would find their “Promised Land”!</p>

  <hr class="calibre10"/>

  <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-182" title="182"></span> Meanwhile, the Christensen family was in real trouble, the gentle Karen being very sick. Frail and ailing at the beginning of the voyage, and carrying her eleventh child, the heavy lurching and pitching of the ship, as each new storm was encountered, upset her more and more until she was forced to take to her bed and stay there. It was no ordinary seasickness that she had, although a calmer sea seemed to soothe her somewhat. Day after day she lay in her bunk unable to retain any of the little nourishment she could bear to swallow, until she grew so pale and weak all who saw her were alarmed. The ship’s doctor was summoned, as fear of cholera and other contagion was always present, but he found nothing of that sort to be alarmed at, only the rebellion of the general processes of her weakened body. He did what he could to ease and comfort her. The Captain and the crew were as helpful as they could be, for the Christensens were much respected on board. Even the quarrelsome cook sent up morsels to tempt Karen’s appetite - but to no avail. It was felt that if she could just hold out until they reached port, where she could rest from the sea’s motion and get plenty of fresh air and fresh milk again, she would have a fair chance of recovery.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It became necessary for someone to be by Karen most of the time. In order to free Christen and his older children, as well as Else for this responsibility, a kindly emigrant sister, Anne Jensen, was hired to look after the three young girls a great deal of the time. Anne was a twenty-eight year old spinster from Vaar, Hjorring Amt, in the Vendsyssel Conference and had been baptised into the Church in Feb, 1861. Like Else, she was emigrating without her own family members and gladly took over the care of Pouline, now eleven, Petrine, age seven, and little Sena (Nielsine) who had her fourth birthday enroute, 15 June, which must have passed by mostly unnoticed because of the deep concern of all for her mother’s welfare.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was about this time, the middie of June, that the weather changed abruptly and became cold and stormy so that the Kenilworth was forced to slow down and made poor progress. Then all<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-182a" title="182a"></span></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-183" title="183"></span>became enveloped in a dense fog and Captain Brown turned to a more southerly course in order to steer clear of the danger from icebergs. The weather grew worse and continued bad. The heavy fog was accompanied by continuous headwinds and the sea became angry and often sent the ship careening back and forth in a frightening manner.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">As the weather worsened, Karen grew worse also as well as weaker. Laurs Myrup and the other Elders administered to the prostrate woman time and time again; but though they blessed her, they made no promise of her recovery. Christen sat by his wife’s bedside in misery at her suffering and Laurs, Maren and others hovered near, but it was the capable Else who cared for the courageous and patient woman’s needs, and it was Christen and Else she clung to in her most fearful moments. Karen seemed aware at times that she was slipping away, and begged to live - to reach the “Land of Zion” - to raise her young daughters - to see her son Christen again. Occasionally she called for her little girls to be near her, but when allowed, they went away frightened and tearful at the sight of her woeful face. Sometimes, in her delirium, she became as wild as the storm-tossed sea and called upon heaven to save them all from a watery grave.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In Andrew Jenson’s personal manuscript history appeared this brief account of Karen’s death:—“Saturday 23 June 1866 - A regular windstorm prevailed from the west. The wife of Christen Christensen died and was buried at sea with much solemnity. (Mrs. Christensen had been in delicate health for some months and the long voyage was too strenuous for her.)” In his published autobiography we find this entry (page 14):—“The death of Sister Christensen called forth much sympathy, as she and her husband had been most liberal with their means in assisting their poor co-religionists to emigrate.” From writings of a granddaughter of Karen, Elsie C. Bartholomew, we find a little about her burial, quote: “Her burial at sea, the same day as her death, was performed as was the custom of such in those days. Her corpse was sewed into a canvas sack<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-184" title="184"></span>into which were also placed scissors and other things thought needful for use in the delivery of her expected child. All was fastened to a large plank, with heavy weights at one end, and then pushed overboard into the troubled sea. So the faithful, loving mother, the gentle Karen, or “Carrie” as she had been affectionately called by her now bereaved husband, never reached the “Land of Zion” with her beloved family; but who can doubt but that she went to a far better place, Heaven, the dearest land of all. Her grieving family must have been comforted somewhat by the many marks of affection, sympathy and respect shown them by their friends and fellow voyagers. Not the least of those to mourn was the daughter-in-law, Else K. The gentle Karen had become so dear to her that to be thus parted from her was like losing a second mother.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">There were, continuous headwinds and fogginess for five weeks in all, which made the voyage both long and dreary. Many storms were encountered and little progress made during that period. On June 26th they encountered a terrific thunder and rain storm, on which occasion all the sails of the ship were taken down in double quick time and the good old ship reeled like a drunken man, causing much alarm among the passengers. It was not until the 5th of July that the fog lifted and then it was found that instead of being near the American shore, as had been expected, they were still far out in the Atlantic Ocean. A number of other deaths took place on the voyage, half of them during that time of wind and fog. We quote again from Andrew Jenson:—“The sad part of our voyage centered around a number of deaths which occurred. The following is a list of those of our company who found a watery grave: On May 24th a child; on May 29th Hulda Rosengren, 9 &amp;frac12 years old and Wilhelmina Berthelsen, 37 years old; on June 2nd a child from the Aarhus Conference; on June 15th Oliver B. Rosengren, an infant; on June 19th Ole Christensen’s child from Vendsyssel Conference; on June 23rd the wife of Chr. Christensen of the Aalborg Conference; on June 25th a young man from the Vendsyssel Conference; on June 27th another child; on July 3rd Christian Beck’s child<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-185" title="185"></span>from the Aalborg Conference; on July 6th Inger S. Petersen, 6 years old; on July 12th Sarah Larsen, an infant; on July 13th Dorthea Beck, a child from the Copenhagen Conference; and on July 15th a young man who committed suicide by jumping overboard.”</p>

    <p class="calibre1">“During the voyage two children were born, the first on May 26th and the second on May 29th when Niels Hansen’s wife, from the Vendsyssel Conference, gave birth to a child which was named Kenilworth Brown in honor of the vessel and its captain. Records of seven marriages which took place on board were also made.”</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On Sunday, July 15th, which was a beautiful sunny day, a number of coast vessels were seen in all directions and joy and animation prevailed among the emigrants. A meeting was held at 8 a.m, at which timely instructions were given the emigrants as to their conduct upon landing in New York. About noon some of the officers looking through their spy glasses said that land was visible to the northwest, but it was not until 6 p.m, that one of the brethren, looking through his glasses, called out with a loud voice, “Land, land”, and soon the green and beautiful coast of Long Island could be seen on the right by everybody. Perhaps only those who for weeks and months have been tossed about on the stormy face of the ocean can appreciate the pleasure of seeing terra firma again. The emigrants, who for about two months had been confined to the decks and berths of Old Kenilworth, appreciated to the fullest extent the change of vision that they enjoyed on that memorable day. The drooping spirits of all were revived and the desire to live in hopes of a happy future was manifested universally among the emigrants. They thanked God for bringing them safely to the shores of America. Some wept with joy. The men shaved, cut their hair, and cleaned up on general principles, while the women began to look for their best dresses in which to attire themselves when the happy privilege of landing should be enjoyed. To the Latter-day Saints the first sight of America had more than usual significance as this was the “land of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-186" title="186"></span>promise”, the land of Joseph, about which they had spoken, dreamed and sung for many years before beholding it.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">About the time they began to see land one of the passengers, a young and foolish man, willfully jumped overboard and was drowned. The ship was hurridly turned around, a boat lowered, and a number of sailors manning it endeavored to save him but did not succeed; he sank in the billows to rise no more until the resurrection. It was stated by his friends that he had been induced to emigrate contrary to his wishes and had repeatedly declared that he would never see America, and so it was. While the rest were eagerly looking for land, he resolutely committed suicide by jumping overboard. The “Kenilworth” passed Sandy Hook after dark and about midnight cast anchor off Staten Island at the entrance of the harbor of New York.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The next morning (July 16th) most of the passengers arose early to look at the country. “How beautiful”, nearly all exclaimed when they emerged from their quarters on the lower decks and saw the green hills of Staten Island and the tall steeples and magnificent buildings of the cities of New York and Brooklyn in the distance, The pleasant morning breeze wafted the pleasing odor of vegetation and flowers out to them. About 11 a.m, a doctor came on board to ascertain if there were any contagious diseases among the emigrants or any other disorder or sickness which might prevent them from landing, but there were none. Consequently, the anchor was lifted and they sailed into the harbor and anchored a short distance off the City of New York, almost opposite Castle Gardens, (Castle Gardens was a high building similar to a theatre, built by the American government for the use and protection of emigrants from the city sharkers, It was a beautiful place.) As the sun rose higher the day became very hot and some of the passengers were taken sick with the heat. From their point of anchorage they had a fine view of New York, Brooklyn, Jersey City, and the string of villages and towns lining the shores of New York Bay. They remained on board all day suffering from the heat, Elders Thomas Taylor<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-187" title="187"></span>and William Folsom (emigration agents for the Church) came on board to arrange for their landing next day.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Shortly before noon on July 17th they took leave of the “Kenilworth” and boarded a small steamer which took them to Castle Gardens. While taking this short trip the heat was very oppressive and one of their number died. Others were so overcome by the heat that they were carried on shore more dead than alive; but, being placed in cool, airy rooms at Castle Gardens and receiving some medical treatment, they all recovered. They had spent 58 days on board the Kenilworth; 52 days since they sailed from Hamborg and 46 days since they first reached the Atlantic Ocean. Other than the few deaths, no serious accidents had happened to them during their long voyage and they realized that the predictions made by President Winderborg, to the effect that they should pass safely over the great deep, had been fulfilled. At Castle Gardens they passed through the usual examinations and scrutiny, including the enrollment of names, ages, nationality, etc.; after which they enjoyed a few hours rest in the large, airy rooms of the Gardens.<strong class="calibre12">*</strong></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Elder Thomas Taylor, emigration agent for the Church in 1866, had experienced much trouble in making the necessary arrangements for transporting the emigrants from New York to the point where they were to meet the church teams at Wyoming, Nebraska. The railroad companies whose lines went out from New York had apparently planned to speculate at the expense of the “Mormons”, and had arbitrarily broken the contract previously made by the Church agent, by adding to the price agreed upon for taking the emigrants westward. The price was unusually high and Elder Taylor knew that the emigrants were not able to pay that extra fare. At length, after having made a special trip to Boston, Mass., he succeeded in closing a satisfactory contract for their conveyance with a railroad company whose terminal was New Haven, Conn. This was an entirely new route and several hundred miles longer than that taken by<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-188" title="188"></span>earlier emigrants west, but turned out to be much cheaper than the regular route had been. Thus at 9 p.m, the company left Castle Gardens and marched through a part of New York City to a point on the East River, where they went on board a large steamship which had been chartered to take them to the proposed railroad terminal in NewH aven, Conn. The night was spent sailing up East River and Long Island Sound when, after a comparatively short but unpleasant voyage of 80 miles, they arrived at New Haven at 5 a.m, July 18th. From the landing place they walked a short distance to the railroad station where they waited about twohou rs for their train to arrive. Here it was discovered that in the turmoil of changing routes and baggage, the Christensen’s two large trunks, containing most of their good clothes, best linens, keepsakes and treasures, had been lost - or stolen. There was nothing they could do about it.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">When the train rolled in about 8 a.m, they boarded the cars and left New Haven, starting northward on their first railroad ride in America. Their route led through the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, and they enjoyed the beautiful scenery very much. To those Danes who had come from a low, flat country, where the highest elevation was less than 600 feet above sea level, the green mountains of Vermont and other elevated points along their route appeared grand and majestic. They traveled in 2nd class cars with comfortable seats, all night and part of the next day. Crossing the St. Lawrence River on the great Victorian Bridge they arrived in Montreal, Canada, early in the afternoon of July 19th. Montreal in 1866 had about 50,000 inhabitants. (At present it is well over a million.) Here they changed cars. The new train placed at their disposal here consisted of a few second-class passenger cars and a number of baggage cars - even some cattle cars were among them, which upon examination were found to be dirty and abominable. Their leaders were informed that they would either have to occupy these cars or wait at least two days for better accommodations, and so they concluded to submit to the inevitable. The dirty cars were swept and cleaned out as much as possible so that they could<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-189" title="189"></span>be occupied, after a fashion. Seated on their bedding or trunks and boxes, they rolled out of Montreal about 7 p.m., traveling westward along the St. Lawrence River.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">It took them two days to travel through Canada this way as they met with an accident on the shores of Lake Ontario where, owing to the poor condition of the railroad bed, some of the cars jumped the track and several nearly toppled over. This accident happened during the night, and in the morning when they beheld their situation they truly felt thankful for having been saved from a terrible disaster. Their train was broken into three sections on the bank of the lake. Had any of the cars tipped over they would probably have rolled down the steep embankment into the water. As it was the track was torn up for several rods. In the afternoon, the railroad men having repaired the damage, they continued their journey and at 7 p.m. arrived in Toronto.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The next day in the afternoon of July 22nd (which happened to be the nineteenth birthday of the emigrant Laurs M. C. Christensen), they arrived at the railroad terminus on the St. Clair River, which separated Canada from the United States and its State of Michigan. A steam ferry boat took them over the river to Fort Huron in Michigan, where they spent the following night in a large freight building at the railroad station. The following day (Monday July 23rd) at 1 p.m., seated in good comfortable cars which they surely appreciated after their experiences in the Canadian baggage cars, they left Fort Huron and traveled westward through the State of Michigan, arriving in Chicago, Ill., that evening late and remained in the cars until morning.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Tuesday 24 July, at 10 a.m., another train was placed at their disposal on which they traveled through the state of Illinois, traveling the remainder of that day and the next and arriving at Quincy on the Mississippi River the morning of July 26th. There a ferry boat took them over the river to the state of Missouri, where they waited in the forest on the bank of the river until 3 p.m. The weather being very warm, a number of them took <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-190" title="190"></span>advantage of the opportunity to bathe in the river, which they thoroughly enjoyed; but a young man of their company who, being a good swimmer, ventured too far out in the swift river and was carried away by the current and drowned. At 4 p.m. they continued their journey through the state of Missouri, the land where the Saints in the early days of the church suffered so much persecution. In several of the larger towns through which they passed the people acted very hostile towards them and made several demonstrations in the shape of insults and threats. The telegraph had of course, previous to their arrival, brought the news of a company of “Mormons” coming, and thus the rough element had time to gather at the different railroad stations to give them their attention when they arrived, and “show their respects”. At various stations the “welcoming committees” were dressed as Indians in war paint and feathers who, brandishing hatchets and knives, shouted oaths at them and gestured meanacingly. Although the majority of the emigrants could not understand a fragment of the language of these ruffians, yet they had little difficulty in interpreting their fierce gesticulations and grimaces as they, being urged on by the hilarious approval of the ribald crowds, outdid themselves in giving all too realistic and nerve-wracking performances. Some of the worst men in the crowds conveyed the idea, by their appearance and actions, that they would like to have treated them as they did their Prophet and co-religionist years before. The engineer of their train also appeared to be a bitter enemy. In stopping and starting the train and in quickening and lessening the speed he treated them to such jerks and violent shocks as ordinarily are experienced only on freight trains. Fortunately none of them were seriously hurt by those unpleasant and unnecessary experiences, but some of their more delicate women were threatened with nervous breakdowns.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The dawn of Friday, July 27th, found them traveling through the western part of Missouri, after having traveled by jerks and shakings all night during which the engine broke down and they<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-191" title="191"></span>were delayed several hours. The supposition was that the wicked engineer, in his endeavor to make it as unpleasant as possible for them, had over-taxed his engine and broken it before he could use up its passengers. Nevertheless they arrived at St. Joseph, on the banks of the Missouri River, early in the afternoon, safe and well; and thus terminated their railroad travel, which had lasted ten days and covered a distance of about 1,700 miles. The round-about way they took through Canada cost $5.00 less for each adult passenger than any other route. On their arrival at St. Joseph they were given only one hour in which to procure provisions for a two-day trip up the Missouri River to Wyoming, Nebraska. They boarded the steamboat “Denver” and left St. Joseph at 5 p.m. The following night was a sleepless one for most of them. In the first place the weather was too sultry for anybody to rest, no place could be found for anyone to make their beds, and in addition, officers and crew of the boat seemed to be regular demons who endeavored to annoy and vex them in every possible way. The next day, July 28th, the steamboat pulled slowly up the muddy Missouri River. The day being extremely hot they were not able to venture out from the coverings of the boat for fear of being sunstruck.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On Sunday, July 29th, they arrived safe and well af the landing below Wyoming, Nebraska, which village was the outfitting place for the Saints crossing the plains that year. Here at this village they could breathe the air of freedom more freely than upon any previous occasion since they commenced their long journey. Both on shipboard and in the railway cars they had been confined to narrow quarters, but here on the grassy hill near Wyoming they could spread out and inhale the fresh air and drink the pure spring water as it gushed from the hillside. (This was the forty-ninth birthday of the recently bereft widower Christen Christensen, lately of Kobberod in Jutland.) Later some of their company were taken sick with fever, a few very seriously. Some of this sickness came upon the sufferers through disobeying the counsel of the brethren in charge, who had advised the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-192" title="192"></span>emigrants not to drink too freely of the ice cold water issuing from the springs but rather use the river water after it had been filtered. At least five of their company died the first week there, three from the Vendsyssel, one from the Aalborg and an old lady from the Copenhagen conference.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On Monday, July 30th, their baggage arrived at the Wyoming landing and was partly carried by hand and partly by teams to the campground on the top of the hill, where they were permitted to pitch their tents on any of the unoccupied land lying adjacent to the village. Those of the emigrants who had no tents made themselves temporary shelters of brush and branches cut from trees in the neighboring woods. While enjoying these conveniences they spent several days busily engaged in washing clothes and otherwise preparing for their journey across the plains. On receiving their baggage at Wyoming they found that many of the boxes had been opened and robbed of their contents, and thus some of the emigrants lost all their clothes and traveling outfits. While there they could draw provisions from the church storehouse which had been erected on the campground.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Several of the Church trains sent from the “Valley” that year after the poor were encamped near Wyoming when this company of emigrantsarrived, and had waited for them several days. Between four and five hundred wagons, with three or four yoke of oxen to each wagon, were sent that year by the Church to the Missouri River after emigrants, most of whom came expecting to cross the plains with church teams. While the emigrants were encamped near Wyoming, that little village assumed an air of importance augmented by the camps of tents and family boweries occupied by those Scandinavian pilgrims. This was not the first company of Scandinavian Saints that had camped there that year, but several companies of British emigrants had preceeded them and were already well out on the plains when they arrived. In fact, the total number of emigrating Saints from Europe in 1866 was 3,327, of whom 1,213 were from the Scandinavian countries. All these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-193" title="193"></span>companies came by way of Wyoming and most of them crossed the plains with church teams.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On Wednesday, August 1st, another company of Scandinavian emigrants, consisting of about 300 souls, arrived in Wyoming. These were the ones who had sailed on the ship “Humboldt” from Hamburg, Germany on June 2nd. The following day, August 2nd, some of the “Kenilworth emigrants” commenced their journey across the plains from Wyoming in Capt. Joseph S. Rawlin’s train. Aug. 4th another group headed westward with Peter Nebeker’s church train. On Aug. 5th another group, who were going with Capt. Andrew H. Scott’s train, moved their things to where the church teams were camped near the church store and were assigned their wagons. George M. Brown, who had been in charge of the Saints on the “Humboldt”, was appointed spiritual leader of this large group of British, Norwegian and Danish emigrants who were to travel in 46 wagons, young Andrew Jenson and his family being among them. It was the intention that this company should roll out of Wyoming on Aug. 7th, but a terrible rain storm, accompanied by thunder and lightning such as none of those from Scandinavia had ever experienced, visited the area. The rain poured down in torrents nearly all that day and the following night until the ground was thoroughly soaked with the downpour. While the storm was at its worst the whole village seemed to be a perfect lake. (Such storms occurred frequently in this locality in July and August each year.) The day after this deluge, Aug. 8th 1866, Capt. Scott’s ox train left Wyoming to cross the plains.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">With the departure of this company the village of Wyoming was almost reduced to its usual limited number of inhabitants, with the exception of a few Scandinavian emigrants and Elders who were waiting for the seasons last company of emigrating Saints to arrive from the east. Capt. Abner Lowry’s church train of ox teams had been, kept back to bring this company and the remaining Saints across the plains. This ox train was known as the Sanpete train, as most of the men and teams in it were from Sanpete Valley in central Utah.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-194" title="194"></span>Among the waiting Saints were a number from Jutland, Denmark, including Christen Christensen and his family and some others to whom he had given financial assistance; Elder Lars Myrup (Maren’s husband); Sister Anne Jensen, who had helped with the Christensen children since their mother’s illness and death on the ocean; Christian Peter Lund, his wife and young family from Sonderhaa; a few returning Elders to whom brother Christensen had loaned funds, and Elder Morten Lund, former president of the Vendsyssel Conference who was returning to his home in Fountain Green, Sanpete Co., Utah. Christen Christensen and his party, having lost their large trunks of clothing enroute, were obliged to purchase more of the necessities at Wyoming. Here, among other things, Christen bought three cooking-stoves, one for himself and one each for his two married children. Little by little his reserve was being exhausted and it must have now been necessary for him to fall back on the gold pieces in the lining of his vest. He had come to depend on the spinster Anne Jensen to a great extent by now, in the absence of his dear wife Karen, until she had grown to seem like a regular member of his family. Anne herself had become very fond of Christen and the little girls and they of her. All, however, were very weary and anxious to be on their way. It was just short of four months since the Christensens had left their home in Thy.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The Norwegian ship “Cavour”, for whose company they were waiting there had been long delayed on account of headwinds, calm and fog, notwithstanding the vessel had taken the shorter route by way of the English Channel. It was July 31st before the ship arrived at New York. The “Cavour” emigrants were at once conveyed over the same route as the one previously taken by the “Kenilworth” company. The dreaded disease cholera, having already broken out on shipboard in brother L. Larsen’s family (most of whom died later on the trip), raged fiercely among the group as they traveled by railroad towards the west, claiming its victims one by one. The rough treatment these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-195" title="195"></span>emigrants received was in part responsible for the heavy death rate. Just before their train arrived in St. Joseph, Missouri, one of the passenger cars took fire and it was with great exertion that the sick were removed from it to escape being burned to death. At St. Joseph a number of the sick and dying had to be left in the hands of wicked people. Their friends obtained no further knowledge as to their fate, and never learned whether they were buried alive or killed by force, for the people with whom they were left were so hateful that they seemingly thirsted for the blood of the Saints. On the voyage by steamer up the Missouri River, nine of the remaining emigrants died, four of them being buried in the river one night and five the next. This poor reduced “Cavour” company finally arrived at the landing near Wyoming on Aug. 11th 1866.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">When these emigrants were taken into camp at Wyoming, sick and weary, there was little time for them to rest. Capt. Abner Lowry’s train of Church teams had already waited long for their arrival and it was now so late in the season that the start across the plains could be postponed no longer if they hoped to get across the mountains that year. Consequently, this cholera-infested company had to get ready in the greatest haste for the long and tedious journey. Two days after their arrival at Wyoming, on Aug, 13th, these emigrants left there, together with the Christensens and others who had been waiting for them. Thus one of the most pitiable treks of any of the Mormon Pioneer companies began. This was the tenth and last Pioneer company to cross the plains that year.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">As had been the case with the other Church trains, the emigrants had been assigned to their wagons, ten or twelve persons to each wagon, and moved their effects thereon. There were about sixty ox-teams in all in charge of Capt. Abner Lowry. (This was the last year that emigrants traveled all the way from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City with ox-teams, as the Union Pacific Railroad was being built from Omaha westward and the following year (1867) was opened for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-196" title="196"></span>several hundred miles west of that river.) It was a sight for those who weren’t used to it to see the teamsters driving long strings of three or four yoke of oxen to each heavily loaded wagon, without reins or harnesses, using only long whips and the three words, “Gee” “Haw” and “Whoa” (which the oxen, through serious lessons had learned to understand).</p>
