  <p class="calibre1">(43) Phillip Van Buren Christensen (4) was born 23 Oct. 1911 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He writes of his own life thus:— “I was told that when I was blessed (7 July 1912 by Joseph H. Carpenter) I was given about all of the family names that were left over on my mother’s side of the family. This has been quite a name to carry and I wonder so often if I have done it justice. I remember very little of my early childhood although I remember generally my mother who died when I was nearing age five.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When she died I was very lonesome and missed her greatly. I recall shortly after her death having been told that she had gone to Heaven. We had a beautiful staircase in our home in Manti and I remember I climbed onto its second landing on a beautiful moonlight night and looked out of the small ornamental window to the east there and knew that I could see my mother’s face up there by the moon. I also recall another time when I felt so alone without her that I somehow got outside on a cold, snowy night and trailed over to Aunt | Claytie Riddle’s in foot deep snow in my bare feet and nightgown, looking for Mother.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I always wanted a horse and though, as I grew bigger, I usually had the use of one of Dad’s - Prince, Duke, Queen, Pigeon, Nig, Brownie, Stride-on, etc., yet I never recall <span id="page-858"></span> owning one of my own until after I was married and purchased one myself - and this for my daughter. I remember when my cousins Joe Neff, Ralph and Warren Riddle and myself, and perhaps others, took the long hikes down to the Sanpitch River to go fishing. We would fish in the ‘black hole’ and catch chubs and occasionally a carp or sucker. We were mighty proud fishermen, and after the warm day wore on we would go swimming in the ‘bloack hole’. It didn’t seem to bother us that there were dead sheep and likely a dead cow in the river just above where we swam. Then came the long trek home. As we came up from the river, hot, tired and hungry, we would often talk about how wonderful it would be, as we rounded the next bend, if we would see a saddled horse for each of us tied there and our names printed on the saddles. What dreams we had - even in daylight!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I recall when Grandfather Snow used to take me fishing, and day of all days would be when he would call up in the afternoon the day before such an event and say, ‘Kaiser’ - that’s what they called me along about the latter part of World War I. He’d say, ‘Kaiser, dig some worms and I’ll be down to get you at 6:00 o’clock in the morning’. Sure enough, at 6:00 o’clock here would come Grandfather driving the buggy and I usually had the worms. We had the long bamboo fishing poles with linen lines and cork bobbers then. Those days when we went to the reservoir fishing were great times in my life. I got to drive the horse and buggy a good deal of the way. We would usually spend a wonderful day fishing. One time I left my pole for a moment, held by a stick; apparently a large carp got hold of the hook and pulled pole and all out into the water and I was unable to get it back. I imagined that the culprit was the biggest fish in the whole reservoir.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“When Grandfather got his Chevrolet automobile it was a great day too, but I must confess that I was a bit apprehensive of some of the rides I took with him. He didn’t learn to drive until he was in his seventies and then he was a ‘real driver’. If he ever hit a bad place in the road he felt that the best way was to speed up and get over it in a hurry. One time coming down Manti Canyon he ran right <span id="page-859"></span> up on the side of a hill and I thought for sure we were going to be tipped over. He was wonderful to us grandkids though. Many were the times that he did with us the things so dear to youngsters’ hearts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Then came the day when I was about eight-and-a-half years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the family. I was a rather sickly looking little fellow and she certainly took me in hand. I have so much to thank her for over the years. She has truly been a second mother to me. How fortunate we all have been to have had the inspiration, encouragement, example, loving service and devotion of this dear woman in our lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember trips out to the Gunnison Ranch with Father and the times we gigged carp in the old sloughs there. Then there were the days spent at Flat Canyon, hoeing corn and herding sheep. I was quite young but I did drive the team from Manti to Flat Canyon and back many times during the last summer or two that we lived at Manti. One time, the day before the Fourth of July, I was out there with my older brother Hale. We wanted to be in Manti for the celebration next day. Toward afternoon Hale said that we were going to Manti. We decided to ride up over the mountains and were thrilled with the prospects of the adventure. About 2:00 o’clock next morning we got up, saddled two horses and started over the mountains toward Manti. We arrived at the old reservoir west of there about daybreak and finally made our way home for that wonderful Fourth of July.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Another time Dad said he would take Marshall, Sherman, Hale and me to Fish Lake if I would get the team in with a load of hay from Flat Canyon at a given time. I had Dad’s big black team, Dan and Bess, and I recall how much they liked to trot. I had a small jag of hay on the wagon and I let the team trot most of the way from Flat Canyon to Manti. I believe I made the whole thirty miles in less than six hours, a record for a team as far as I was concerned. I used to haul loads of potatoes and grain, besides hay from Flat Canyon to Manti for Father. I remember earlier, when I was about ten years old, I used to drive our cows <span id="page-860"></span> down to the lane west of Manti, herd them there during the daytime and bring them back in the evening. It seems that even as a young boy I always had some responsibility. Father saw to it that I learned to work.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The greatest times were when Father took us to the mountains. I recall once when he told me that if I would get a load of potatoes in from the Flat Canyon ranch that he would take me deer hunting. I did and we went up Manti Canyon and camped over night and got up early next morning before it was light, had our breakfast around the campfire, then started out looking for deer. I remember that we saw something white moving through the timber and Father said though we didn’t see a deer on that trip we saw the tail of one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“In August 1925 came the move from Manti to Provo, and since the house Dad had arranged for us there was not quite ready, we lived for a few weeks with some of Aunt Myrtle’s relatives. Here I met Gilbert Tanner, who was two days younger than I, and we became steadfast friends. We used to kid each other a lot, saying I was the ‘old man’ and he was the ‘youngster’. I made some other wonderful friends the nine months we lived in Provo. I particularly recall my association in Troop 10 of the Scouts in Manavu Ward with Deb Tregeagle as Scout Master. I always was sorry that I didn’t get to complete my scout work under Deb. But then came the move to the farm at Orem.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had attended Manti High School my freshman year and then attended Provo High as a sophomore. I was quite small in stature when I went up to Orem High School with Father to get registered as a junior. Mrs. Cunningham was helping with the registration and stated that she didn’t teach the freshmen anymore. It was with some indignation that I told her I was a junior. She taught me English that year and was a wonderful teacher. I finished high school in 1928 and that fall started at the BYU. I weighed slightly over 100 pounds at the time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I only went to college about six weeks that first year and then quit and worked on the farm there in Orem. The next year I attended BYU for <span id="page-861"></span> two quarters and again ran the farm. The third year I went two quarters to the University of Utah and then came back to work on the farm. By this time my brother Sherman was married and he and Lois kindly invited me to come back and stay with them, so I took the bus to Washington D. C. I took some training at the Boyd Business University in shorthand and typing, worked at the Hot Shoppe waiting on the curb and later as ‘curb manager’, and then went to work out at the airport restaurant. By June I was mighty homesick and since a friend from Orem, Leo Poulsen, was just returning from a mission to Sweden and had stopped in at Washington to say hello, I rode back to Provo with him and some other fellows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I started college again at BYU that next fall. During the summer I worked on the place in Orem, excepting for about a month when I went up to Tulsa, Wyoming and worked in the hay for McGuinnes Livestock Co., running what they called a scatter-rake. I spent three more late summers up there working in the hay for that company, alternating it with college and working on our Orem place. After seven years I finally graduated from college, June 1935.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“That fall I returned to Washington D. C. We had Democratic representatives in the capitol then and all of them seemed to know of my Republican background. It seemed next to impossible for me to get a job although I had located one that was available and to my liking with the Resettlement Administration. I had to get a clearance from the Democratic party and our Utah representatives were not about to give me one. I went into the office of Senator O’Mahoney of Wyoming, and since I had worked for a period of time in Wyoming I told him of my position. The Senator referred me to his secretary, Mr. Green. After hearing my problem this fine gentleman made a phone call to the Resettlement Administration in my behalf and after a long conversation I heard him say. ‘I don’t give a damn - give this young man a job!’ Needless to say, I received the job and worked in the travel audit department.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Starting the second semester, which began <span id="page-862"></span> in Feb. 1936, I went to law school at George Washington University, attending at nights from 7:00 | o’clock to 9:30 and working days for the Resettlement Administration. It was difficult for me to study late at nights so I used to get up at 4:00 o’clock each morning and do my studying when my mind was clear. After school was out, the early summer of 1937, I was sent down to work at the regional field office in Raleigh, North Carolina for three months. I was able to rent a lovely room in a large southern home. But I returned to Washington D. C. for work and school that fall. It was during that year that I attended, with a group from Utah, a White House reception given by President Roosevelt. A young lady, who worked in the office of Congressman J. Will Robinson from Utah, whose name I have forgotten, invited me to go. Although I never had any high regard for President Roosevelt, I’ll never forget how impressed I was as he walked by with his cane, supported by a member of his family, his chin out as the band played ‘Hail to The Chief’. I was close enough to touch the President and I was impressed by the magnitude of the office and the pomp and color that was at the White House that night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I had an opportunity to be transfered from Washington to the regional office in San Francisco and although my law school plans had to be changed, I jumped at the chance. I was able to purchase a 1935 Ford four-door sedan automobile that had been a taxi, for $200.00. As soon as school was out the spring of 1938, I hauled out a few passengers to Utah and then drove on to San Francisco. Here I arranged to take one of the examinations that I was not able to take at George Washington University through the University of San Francisco and came out with an “A”. I went to night school at the University of San Francisco, then called St. Ignatius College. After a year there my work for the government was terminated and the mountains and canyons in Utah again beckoned me.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“At this time Father was interested in the Red Hills Mining Co., the Grand Deposit Mining Co., and other mining interests through one Paul Lyon. I had often wondered why the apparent <span id="page-863"></span> tremendous amount of money Father invested was not more productive. But anyway, I went to work for the Grand Deposit Mining Co., which was about seventy miles northeast from Ely, Nevada. It was quite an experience going down the shaft and working in the mine. I had the usual trying experiences of a ‘green hand’. My main partner was a fellow who had had some trouble with the Juvenile Court and was on probation and he didn’t spare me. During the summer Father came out to the mine on different occasions and we talked about my continuing on at law school. He told me that he would help me but he wanted me to go full time. At the end of the summer I was paid partly in cash and partly in mining stock for my work; the latter I sold at quite a disadvantage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“While working in San Francisco I had purchased a 1938 Oldsmobile. During my school that winter at the University of Utah I was forced to sell it and took in as part payment an old Austin. That summer of 1940 I drove it up to Wyoming to work for the livestock company again and took my younger brother Cullen and two other fellows with me. I don’t recall how much money I was able to save from my summer’s work but though it was not a great deal it did help a little in getting started back to school at the U of U that late fall. I had pretty well concluded my law studies at the U of U by Christmas of 1940, but had one or two other classes I had to take. Father was still helping me financially but I did what work I could.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“It was in the spring of 1940 that I met Gwen - first at the home of Mrs. Pardoe when I interrupted one of her private dramatic lessons and another time in Keeleys on East Center Street. And then I saw her leading the Richfield Drum and Bugle Corps in some function at BYU. I recall her long black hair, ready smile and her beauty. I had been with girls before and had thought I was in love but I knew this was the real thing. That summer I went down to see her at her home in Richfield on one or two occasions, before going to Wyoming. And of course after school started I came down from Salt Lake to Provo to see her as often as possible, since she was again attending <span id="page-864"></span> BYU. We became engaged just before Christmas. I recall well that night. We were in an old Plymouth coupe that I then had, in which I used some sort of alcohol base as an anti-freeze. The night was cold and we were driving over toward Spanish Fork when the alcohol boiled out of the radiator somewhat and there was a short in the wiring and the car caught fire. This was quite something to have happen on our engagement night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The Second World War was brewing in Europe and conditions were mighty uncertain; and although I was doing a little work after Christmas in the law office with Dad and Sherman, I talked to them and told them I was going to apply to the FBI for a position as special agent. I will never forget the long telegram I received just after the first of that year 1941, offering the sum of $3,200.00 a year for this position in the FBI. I immediately replied that I would take the job. Gwen and I discussed my leaving, and since she was finishing her last year at college we didn’t plan on being married until it was over. In talking of my future office assignments she stated that she didn’t care where we went if it were not a hot place like New Orleans.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I arrived in Washington D. C. Mar. 3, 1941, at the Justice Building. I recall the beautiful brief case, the fine looking men, all strangers to me, and my taking my place among them in the big, beautiful room. I was thrilled as my name, appearing alphabetically on the list between a Carlson and a Dutwyler, was read out and I was sworn in and received my brief case. A 38 revolver was in it, along with volumes of rules, regulations and instructions. My counselor was Jeptha Rogers, a tall Texan. General instructions were given and we were told to go out and buy some range clothing and be back to leave for the Marine base at Quantico by bus that evening. The training was rather short, seven weeks, but thorough and concentrated and consisted of firearms use, photography, jujitsu, fingerprinting, etc.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The day of greatest excitement came when we received our office assignments, and guess what? I was assigned to New Orleans. I called Gwen about it as soon as I could and she relieved <span id="page-865"></span> my apprehensions by saying it didn’t matter and that would be wonderful. We decided we would be married in June as soon as her school was out and she could come to New Orleans, since I was not allowed time off.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Phillip was married 19 June 1941 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Gwen Johnson (b. 1 Sep. 1918 in Sigurd, Utah to Joseph B. and Mida Dastrup Johnson). Gwen tells of riding down by car to New Orleans with her future father-in-law A. H. Christensen and her future sisters-in-law Norma Christensen and Elaine C. Southwick, and what a wonderful time the sixty-nine year old gentleman showed his three companions. She said she almost felt that she had her honeymoon before her marriage instead of after. The wedding itself was held in a large southern ancestral mansion owned by a member of the branch of the LDS church there. A number of the branch members took over full arrangements for the wedding and open house which followed, complete with music, flowers, wedding cake and all, which seemed to be overseen by framed pictures of ancient ancestors of the mansion’s owners looking down from their places of honor on the various walls. Norma and Elaine stood with Gwen in the line and Father Christensen and Phil’s cousin, Marshall Neff, stood up with him. The Branch president, Brother Evans, performed the ceremony which was attended by the FBI special agents in the area and their wives, together with a number of branch members. Gwen, who was very near sighted, said she left her glasses off for the occasion because Phil didn’t like her in them too much and so was unable to get a good view of everyone or to identify many of those in attendance afterwards.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Phil continues with the history:- “We took up our residence in an apartment right next to cousin Marshall and his wife Viola and they were so good to us. Gwen, bless her heart, was alone a lot of the time since I was away from home so much. It was not until she obtained a job with the War Department, working at the Port of Embarkation, that some of that lonesomeness vanished.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“My work in New Orleans was fascinating. <span id="page-866"></span> When American became involved in the war, Dec. 1941, we agents were asked to round up the enemy aliens who had been located and kept catalogued through painstaking investigations done previously. I had been assigned the job of going over all the books and records of the Orcombantanti, which was the association of Italian world war veterans, which were mostly made up of speeches and reports quite inflammable against the United States. The president of this group was one Phillippe Bellipanni and the secretary was Guiseppe Verderaime. We were ordered to pick these two men up and have them interned. When we closed in on Bellipanni his wife had just had a baby, their first, and he cried and swore in no uncertain terms that we could cut his head off if he were not loyal to America. We found out that most of the Italians were very loyal to America but the story was different with some of the German aliens who were there. They were usually stoical, bitter and strong in their convictions as to the right and power of the Third Reich.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I remember chasing a German newspaperman, suspected of being a spy, down the wrong way of a one-way street as he attempted to get away in his car. I recall on 12 Dec. 1941 that another agent and I were sent down to the mouth of the Mississippi River where the Gulf Refining Co. had provided a beautiful boat and a guide for the FBI. Our guide was named Felix Barrious who spoke the Cajun language. On this trip Barrious took us through the bayous at the river’s mouth, looking for Japanese fishermen supposed to be in the area who were suspected of providing information and help to Japanese and Germans who might be entering the country illegally by way of the Mississippi. We picked up a German alien who was alleged to have made some statements against President Roosevelt. He had a large knife in his possession when we captured him, but of course denied any allegiance to Germany. However, he was interned and sent to a detention camp somewhere in Texas,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We were looking specifically for a Japanese fisherman nicknamed ‘Tampico’ because he had <span id="page-867"></span> jumped ship at Tampico, Mexico and come to America. He ran a shrimp fishing outfit and his boat was called the ‘Tokyo’. It was difficult to tell the Japanese from Philippinos. On a number of boats we boarded to search, the occupants wore large badges with ‘I am Philippino’ printed on them. We finally located the Tokyo and asked for Tampico. His men said he was supposed to come late in the evening and pick up the day’s catch of shrimp in a truck with the name Tokyo printed on the side. Four of us agents in two cars later staked out the road leading to the fishing docks and sure enough, about 10:00 p.m. the Tokyo truck came along. We ran it off the road and found an American man driving ‘Tampico’s’ truck. He stated that Tampico was at his home in Algiers, just across the river from New Orleans, and gave me his address. It was midnight when we four agents arrived at Tampico’s but his lights were on. A peek in the window revealed a Japanese-looking fellow standing in the middle of the kitchen floor beside his packed suitcase. Two of us entered from the back door and two from the front, and when we asked Tampico where he was going he answered in broken but understandable English that he knew he was going to be picked up and possibly interned, and since he didn’t want people to think he was trying to run away, he hired someone to run his equipment, packed his bags, and was waiting there at home to be picked up. Believe it or not - we didn’t - and interned him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“There was a ‘German Baron’ and his very lovely wife that we picked up shortly afterwards in Baton Rouge. He was supposed to be in America ‘lassoing alligators’. The last I heard of him he was head of the linen detail in an internment camp in Texas. There were many other cases that kept us on the go.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The summer of 1942 I was transfered to Indianapolis, Indiana, and our first child, Bryce, was born there the spring of 1943. Here, among others, I investigated a very involved case in which some officers of the Anaconda Wire and Cable Co. were charged with fraud. They were suspected of circumvention of tests of cable and <span id="page-868"></span> wire used by the armed services. Although the case of war fraud was uncontrovertably established, the company itself was given a ‘clean bill of health’. The guilty officers pleaded guilty and were given suspended sentences, but there was much bitterness and criticism because they were not sent to jail. It was while working on this case that I first became acquainted with Tom Clark, Justice of the United States Supreme Court, who was head of the war fraud unit of the dept.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We subsequently moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where I became resident agent, which was a wonderful job. We were there almost a year and liked it, although our living accomodations left much to be desired. I was involved in investigations of communist activities in the large plants in the area: International Harvester, Farnsworth Television, General Electric, etc. I was transfered out of Fort Wayne upon very short notice because of threats being made against my safety. We were sent to Newark, New Jersey in 1944. My work there made me begin to yearn for the west. When Bryce became ill we requested a transfer, although we had many fast friends there among the agents and their wives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Requests for transfers were not always honored and often resulted in the cancelling of the next raise. I will never forget the wonderful letter of transfer written by Director Hoover, who wrote something like this:- ‘It has come to my attention that due to the illness of your young son you have requested a transfer to a warmer climate. I have this day issued orders that you be immediately transferred to Los Angeles, California,’ and then he gave his best wishes. Not long after our arrival in Los Angeles I received a raise. Hoover was a wonderful director. He was very strict but very fair, and in meritorious cases he certainly did the best he could to heip his employees.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We bought a lovely three-bedroom home in Los Angeles near the intersection of Pico and Overland. I was assigned mostly to bank robbery investigations. I recall with some nostalgia the cases involving the ‘Paper Bag Bandit’, the ‘Pin Stripe Bandit’, and the long search for a man called <span id="page-869"></span> ‘Mad Dog Horan’, one of the most wanted fugitives on the list of the FBI. I recall a most interesting bank robbery case involving the theft of something over $100,000.00 from two messengers from the Hollywood State Bank taking money out to the Lockheed Aircraft Company. For a month Director Hoover was in Los Angeles on this case. The bandits were finally apprehended and most of the money recovered, being dug up from a grave at the Sawtelle Military Cemetery. This case was written up in the July 1957 issue of Reader’s Digest.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I took and passed the California Bar examination. I resigned from the Bureau in October 1945 and returned to Utah to practice law with my father, my brother Sherman, and subsequently my younger brother Cullen. At that time our firm was known as Christensen &amp; Christensen. After Sherman was appointed Federal District Judge in Utah and Father retired, Joseph Novak, Fred R. Paulson and Thomas S. Taylor joined the firm. Novak subsequently withdrew from the firm and it is now known as Christensen, Paulson &amp; Taylor, having four partners: Phillip V. Christensen, Cullen Y. Christensen, Ford R. Paulson, and Thomas S. Taylor, and an associate, Robert L. Moody.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Three daughters have been born to us since we returned to Provo - Betty, Ann, and Mary. All of our children have been a great joy to Gwen and me. We are proud of their accomplishments and appreciative of the contribution each of them make in his or her own way to the happiness and success of our family. Perhaps it was inevitable that because Bryce was an FBI baby, born as a. Hosier in Indiana, that he would become a special agent of the FBI. After serving a mission in Denmark, graduating from BYU, and marrying, he received his appointment, was sworn in, and received his training at the Marine Base in Quantico. He is now working as a special agent in the area of Albany, New York and, among other things, investigating bank robberies. Betty Lee is married and at present lives in Butte, Montana. Her husband is an airline’s pilot. She has recently taken up oil painting and has painted some beautiful pictures. Ann won first place in piano competition <span id="page-870"></span> for beginners in the Utah State Fair in 1966; placed second for Junior High age in the Baldwin piano contest in 1966; won first place in the Baldwin contest in 1968 in her age division and is now working on her own recital to be presented at BYU this May of 1969. Mary Kathryn joins her sister Betty in her love of horses, has her own horse and is taking riding lessons. She also does wonderfully well making things with her hands and is a great reader. I wouldn’t be surprised to see her excel in literature somehow. She might even become a writer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“During the later years of my life, particularly since our return to the Provo area, the church has come to mean a great deal in my life. Gwen and I went to the Salt Lake Temple and were sealed for eternity, 20 May 1948, also having our first two children sealed to us at that time. The other two were born in the covenant. While we lived in the River Grove Ward in Provo’s West Utah Stake, I was a member of the High Council and served as Building Fund Chairman for the building of the new Rivergrove Ward chapel. Upon moving to Orem in 1952 I was sustained as Second Counselor to Bishop Laurence W. Palmer of the Orem Eleventh Ward and served for two years. In 1957 I was made Bishop of the Orem Nineteenth Ward and served in that capacity until our family moved back to Provo in 1962. For over three years now I have served as a member of the East Sharon Stake High Council under President Ben E. Lewis. Each day I live I am more convinced that the only way true happiness and joy can come is through association in the church, through attempting to live its principles, and mostly from gaining a true testimony of the divinity of Christ and of his message to the world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Gwen has always had a staunch testimony of the gospel and worked in the church organizations. During our stay in the Provo Rivergrove Ward she was Ward Relief Society President, being sustained as such at age thirty. Shortly after we moved to Orem in 1952 she was sustained as Sharon Stake Relief Society President. She has taught many classes in both Relief Society and Sunday School <span id="page-871"></span> and has always been an inspiration to those she taught. At present she is serving as a Stake Missionary in the East Sharon Stake, and together with her companion, Sister Arlene Heaton, is doing a wonderful job. Life has been very good to both of us and to our children and we do appreciate all of our blessings so very much.”</p>
