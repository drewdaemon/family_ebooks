  <p class="calibre1">(50) David Christian Christensen (8) was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, 16 Nov. 1915. He grew up in the Gunnison area and attended school there until his family moved to Manti, Utah not long after he turned ten years old. Here he continued his education, graduating from Manti High School in May 1934, after having acted as Studentbody President during the year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Salt Lake City became David’s home soon after his graduation. His father having passed away in Dec. 1932, David was now the “man of the family” and his mother’s main help in the things about the place that needed a man’s touch. He was a great help to her. In Salt Lake he registered at the University of Utah and took some classes there in the department of Mines and Engineering for a time. He was somewhat of a hustler and although the great depression was in progress in the country he did what he could find to do to help out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">David was married 17 Dec. 1941 to Myrtle Osborn (b. 9 July 1917 in Escalante, Utah to Warren Jasper and Ruby Twitchell Osborn). Their marriage was solemnized twenty-and-a- half years later, 21 June 1962, in the Salt Lake <span id="page-889"></span> Temple. War preparations were very much in evidence at the time of their marriage and David, as well as Myrtle, were soon engaged in the same, as evidenced by a letter he wrote to his sister Gladys in San Francisco about a year after they were wed. A copy of the letter follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Cheyenne, Wyoming 5 Nov. 1942</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Dear Gladys: Yes, we are more busy now than ever. It seems like the ships (planes) keep coming in faster all the time and fewer men to do the work - more females. It’s ten or eleven hours every day so we do manage to keep out of mischief at home. We have been lucky to have the same hours the past two months; hope we can have the same luck, all winter - and I do mean winter! We sure would like to live in California by Lake Merrit again. You don’t know how lucky you are not to have to plow through snow on your way to work. We are glad and mighty lucky to be together, however, so in spite of the long hours and Wyoming in general, we are still in love and happy. And the money that’s rolling in - ah, if living just wasn’t so damn high! By the way, I have had another raise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“We had a battle on our hands a few days ago. It seems they had us on our way to New York; but me, I turns up the next morning to work in good old Cheyenne just the same. Well, there were a lot of promises made to bring us back in a short time, but I found a fellow who lived in the east and they sent him instead. It sure did sound fun but we still want to stay west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The draft board hasn’t sent any more news to me and I have my Navy papers all ready to go if they do. I think I’m safe until February anyway.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Myrtle and I are planning to fly home for Christmas and surprise Mother; that is if we can both get a couple of days off together. We can get half fare and that’s cheaper than bus - so why not? It would be swell if you could come too. Myrtle hasn’t even been inside my kind of airplane yet so I think it will be a swell treat for her. There isn’t much news to tell you from here so I <span id="page-890"></span> guess I’ll sign off for tonight. Love, Dave &amp; Myrtle &amp; Dicky. (Dicky is our new little boy-bird - lots of fun to play with).”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When World War II was over David and Myrtle returned to Salt Lake City and joined with his mother in buying a duplex home there at 1333 South 6th East. Millie lived in the one side until her death, while David and his family occupied the other, and still live there. He and Myrtle have three children, a son and two daughters, the first daughter born before they returned to Salt Lake from California where they had been transferred from Wyoming.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In all, David has worked for United Air Lines for some twenty-eight years. He worked for them first in Oakland, Calif. for three months, then two years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, two years in San Francisco, and for the past twenty-four years at the Salt Lake airport. For the past eight years his wife Myrtle has been working in the delivery room of the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake as a registered nurse. They are still busy, happy people.</p>
