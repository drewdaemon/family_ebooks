  <h2 class="calibre9" id="foster-children">FOSTER CHILDREN</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">(A) Ada Lorena Madsen, daughter of Victor August Hastrup Madsen, adopted son of Bishop Christian August Madsen of Gunnison and his wife Sarah Olesen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 14 Mar. 1888. Ada was the fifth child and fourth daughter born to this couple. Else K. Christensen was the midwife who assisted with her birth and also cared for her and her mother during the time of the mother’s illness which followed. Ada was born with a malfunctioning heart and was very frail herself, needing special care.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Knowing that she could not live long, twenty-seven year old Sarah Madsen exacted a promise from Else K. Christensen that she would take her baby daughter after she passed away and raise her as her own. Else promised. Sarah Madsen died 25 May 1888 and was buried in the Gunnison cemetery a few days later beside a baby daughter, Almira, who had passed away some six years before at two years of age.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sarah Madsen died on Friday and her baby daughter hadn’t been given a name yet. But she was blessed and given the name Ada Lorena Madsen the day after her mother’s death, Sat. 26 May 1888, in the home and Else K. Christensen took the little two month twelve day old invalid to her home to raise as her own, as promised. Though the father, Victor A. Madsen, would not consent to Laurs and Else adopting his daughter, she having been sealed to him and his wife in the Covenant, yet he consented to them calling her by the surname of Christensen as long as she was with them and gave them a signed statement to that effect.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Much of the rest of Ada’s story has been told in earlier pages of this book - the love she was given and the sunshine she brought into the Christensen home - her trip to Denmark at two-and-a-half years of age with her foster mother - her untimely death within two months and a few days of her ninth birthday, 3 Jan. 1897. She was baptized a member of the LDS Church 21 July 1896.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A little more than ten years following her death, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-670" title="670"></span> Laurs and Else had her endowments taken care of in the Manti Temple, 22 Feb. 1907.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ada was buried on the Madsen plot beside her mother in the Gunnison cemetery. Her tombstone bears the following inscription: - “In loving memory of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and Sarah Madsen - Born 14 Mar. 1888 - Died 3 Jan. 1897 - In sore distress your life has past - You loved us all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen”. Less than eleven months after Ada’s death her natural father, forty-two year old Victor August Madsen, joined the others of the little group resting there on the Madsen plot in Gunnison cemetery. He died 16 Nov. 1897 and was survived by his second wife and a son and two daughters by his first wife.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(B) Anna Theresa Carlson, daughter of Carl Gustaf Carlson and Hulda Charlotte (or Caroline) Karlsdotter or Karlson, was born 9 Feb. 1889 in Fjarstad, Östergötland, Sweden. She was christened (døbt) in the Swedish church there, 24 Feb. 1889. She was called by her second name, the spelling of which was eventually shortened to Tresia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Tresia was going on four years old her father took his own life. Her mother, left without means of support, was forced to return to the home of her aged father to live taking Tresia with her. Soon another little girl was born to the young widow and Tresia had a baby sister, Edith. The old grandfather, however, made things altogether miserable for the three of them, but especially Tresia’s young mother, complaining over every crust of bread that went into the mouths of her little ones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia’s mother was contacted by Mormon missionaries and soon joined the LDS Church, 5 Apr. 1894, becoming a member of the Linköping Branch there in Sweden. At this her father became even more concerned with the “extra little mouths to feed” and the unhappy mother knew hardly what to do or where to turn.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Long before, Tresia’s father’s father had passed away when her father was very young and his mother married a Mr. Newren, said to have been a musician, and by him she had at least two sons, Tresia’s father’s half brothers. Family tradition claims that Mr. Newren was accidently drowned when crossing a stream late one evening while returning from a dance at which he had been the fiddler. Be that as it may, Tresia’s grandmother, the widow Newren, joined the LDS Church and, together with her two sons, emigrated to America and Zion. Later she died in Utah and Tresia’s mother received a small sum of money from the grandmother’s estate, as her husband’s portion in behalf of his children.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this time Tresia’s mother, encouraged by the Mormon missionaries, was herself planning to emigrate to Zion as soon as she could get the means. She decided to use the children’s small legacy to send her oldest daughter, Tresia, to stay with one of her husband’s half brothers in Utah until she and the younger daughter could join her. So Tresia left Sweden by ship, in company with a returning Mormon missionary and his Swedish bride, the autumn of 1895, enroute to Zion and her half-uncle Mr. Newren’s home in Salt Lake City. Little Swedish Tresia was going on seven at the time and could speak no English. Mr. Newren was a polygamist with two wives and two separate families. Times were hard and money was scarce and with many mouths to feed, Tresia was not overly welcome. She stayed with Mr. Newren’s one family in Salt Lake for awhile and then was sent to Scofield in Carbon County to live with his other wife and family, where she remained for about a year. In the meantime the first wife and family had moved to Gunnison, Sanpete County and Tresia was sent to live with them again. Then these Newrens left Gunnison and she ended up living with an elderly couple in Centerfield who were no relation as far as she knew and whose names she soon forgot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia was baptized a member of the LDS Church 31 July 1897, while living in Centerfield, She had never attended school up to this point so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-672" title="672"></span> was sent to school in Centerfield when it opened in the fall. She went to school taking a sandwich of dried bread spread with bacon grease for her lunch. She remembers being hungry most of the time. School in Centerfield was short lived for Tresia however, for after a few days of it she wandered away several miles into north Gunnison and became lost - and nobody came to find her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She spent that night sleeping on the steps of the Relief Society hall in northwest Gunnison. We have learned previously in this book how she ended up next day at the home of Laurs and Else K. Christensen and how they decided to give her a home, saying, “One more mouth won’t make any difference.” Tresia writes: - “After I had been shifted around from one family to another for two years, the Christensens took me in. It reads like a book. They were so wonderful to me. There are no words written or spoken that are good enough to describe them. They treated me as their own - God bless them! The rest of the Christensen family was grand to me also.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia took the surname of Christensen while she lived with Laurs and Else and their family. She started school in the first grade in Gunnison when she was going on nine and atteded there through the seventh grade. She left and went to Salt Lake City to work just before she turned sixteen, so she lived with the Christensens for somewhat more than six years. She always kept in touch with them, however, and deemed them “her family”, returning to visit them on occasions as long as any of them lived. Even today she keeps in touch with their children, for she is still living at age eighty in Maricopa, California (1969).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia worked at various things in Salt Lake City. She was a nursemaid for awhile and then did housework. She worked in different cafes and had a good job in a store at one time. After some six years of working around like this she met and married a man by the name of William H. Scott. They were married in Salt Lake City, 11 June 1911, when she was twenty-two. Mr. Scott owned a drugstore in Blackfoot, Idaho and took Tresia there to live. But William drank and the couple’s marriage <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-673" title="673"></span> ended in divorce in December of that same year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following her divorce Tresia went from Idaho to Oakland, California and worked there for nearly two years. Then she moved to Dillon, Montana to work. Here she met a bachelor ten years older than she, by the name of James Lacy. The two went to Evanston, Wyoming to be married, 3 July 1917. Tresia called her new husband Jim and he was lacking five months of being thirty-eight when they were wed and she was five months past twenty-eight. They lived in Dillon, Montana for five more years where Jim worked for a lumber company and an ice company. They then went to Delano, California for a year and a half, where he worked as a mason. Taft, California became their home next for about a year and a half and here Jim worked building schools and as a steam fitter. The oil fields in Maricopa nearby furnished him with his next employment and here they lived and worked for the next seventeen years. Jim then worked in the oil fields at Taft for three and a half years, but they continued to live at Maricopa. It was in Maricopa that Jim died of a heart attack, 4 Feb. 1946, and thus ended more than twenty-eight and a half years of a very happy marriage. Tresia wrote: - “Jim Lacy was a wonderful man and he was grand to me.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia continued to live on in Maricopa and here she became acquainted with a widower by the name of Ray H. Moore. On 4 May 1951 the two went to Las Vegas, Nevada and were married. Tresia writes: - “Ray Moore was also a very good man and kind to me. We had been married just a little over two years when he died of a heart attack, 30 May 1953. He had three children by his first wife and through them I now claim nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren who are also very kind to me.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tresia, very pretty as a girl and a beautiful woman even at eighty years of age (1969), never had any children of her own. But she is surrounded by those who love her for she is gracious, friendly, outgoing and greatly admired. She still lives in Maricopa, California, keeping her own apartment but sharing cooking responsibilities with a lady <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-674" title="674"></span> friend next door, with whom she says she “has a ball”. Though her eyes are rather poor now and she is forced to use a cane some, yet she gets around among her friends and enjoys life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For a number of years after Ray Moore’s death she made a yearly trip to Salt Lake City each autumn by bus and stayed with her cousin Della Newren Rudy in Salt Lake City for several weeks. At these times she visited around in Salt Lake and Provo with the descendants of Laurs and Else K. Christensen, to the fourth generation. She attended several Christensen family reunions. She is the only person now living that ever dwelt intimately with Laurs and Else and their family. She has added so many “memories” to the pages of this book.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the happiest event in Tresia’s later years took place 12 Oct. 1965, when she went to the Salt Lake Temple for her own endowments and was sealed to her second husband, James Lacy, for all eternity. She is now waiting hopefully for the opportunity to go again to the temple and be sealed to her own father and mother, together with her deceased sister Edith. Their temple ordinances are now being taken care of in preparation for this holy work. May she be thus blessed! Someday she will meet again with those she once knew and loved, as we shall meet our loved ones, on the other side of the veil.</p>
