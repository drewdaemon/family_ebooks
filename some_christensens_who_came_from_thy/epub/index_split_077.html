  <p class="calibre1">(31) Nephi Wesley Christensen (8) We copy from the Salt Lake Tribune writeup at the time of Wesley’s death, under the headlines “Prominent Dividend Mining Man Dies in S. L. C. Hospital”, as follows:— “Nephi Wesley Christensen, 48, prominent resident of Dividend and well known mining man, died Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. (10 Aug. 1955) in a Salt Lake City hospital following a short illness (Holy Cross Hospital).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He was born 16 May 1907 at Gunnison (Sanpete Co., Utah) son of Arthur and Millie Gledhill Christensen. He attended Manti High School and served several years in the Navy. (There is an error here - he attended Gunnison High School, not Manti).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He married Leola Burraston Aug. 28. 1929 in Nephi. They have made their home in Dividend for the last twenty-eight years. During that time he had held many positions with Tintic Standard Mining Co. and at the time of his death was General Superintendent of the mine.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Christensen was very active in civic affairs and was a Past Master of Tintic Lodge No. 9 F &amp; A. M., and was Exalted Ruler of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks Lodge of Eureka, Utah, the year before his death, holding offices in each at the time of his death. He had acted for a number of years as Democratic Chairman for the Tintic District.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Funeral services will be held Saturday in the Quist-Fairbanks Funeral Home in Orem. Rev. George Webber will officiate in conjunction with Tintic Mason and Elk lodges. Friends may call at the funeral home from 7 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday before the services to view the body. Burial will be in the Provo City Cemetery. <span id="page-817"></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Survivors include his widow and one son, Dennis Wesley Christensen, Dividend; and one daughter, Mrs. Eugene (Colleen) McGee and one grandson of Boulder, Colorado; his mother, Mrs. Millie Gudmundson, Salt Lake City; three brothers, A. Melrose, Max and David, all of Salt Lake City; two sisters, Mrs. Douglas (Grace) Larsen, Salt Lake, and Miss Gladys Christensen, San Francisco, California.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wesley’s wife, Rosaleola, or Leola, Burraston Christensen (b. 2 Nov. 1912 in Goshen, Utah to James and Ruth Esther Ercanbrack), now Mrs. Curtis O. Montgomery of Sterling, Colorado, writes of him:- “Wesley joined the service a year or two after his graduation from high school. He spent several years in the Navy band. I don’t remember his rating.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Wes was known to be one of the best swimmers around, in fact a beautiful swimmer. There were so many things that were hobbies of his and he was a master at all of them. Because of his wonderful memory he was asked to participate in various offices even after he became ill.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He was very much like his father in many, many ways; being very quiet and so thoughtful and kind, but in looks he favored his mother’s side of the family although many people mistook him for his cousin Sherman Christensen in his last few years. (They did look alike then). Wes was about 5′11″ tall, with curly auburn hair, brown eyes and a handsome straight stature (well disciplined). To me he was almost perfect.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“He died of kidney infection (nephritis) and finally heart failure. I sensed something beautiful about his death. He didn’t attend church a great deal except with me and when the children were small, but he was a deeply religious man at heart.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“I met Wesley in Dividend. I was assistant postmistress at the Tintic Standard Mining Co. there for many years. I acted as such again for a few months when he became ill and just before he passed away. With the exception of some few months in about 1928 when he left the mine to help his father on a ranch, Wes was in the mining <span id="page-818"></span> business all of his adult life.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Echos of the past are heard in the words of a letter written by Wesley’s sister Grace to his sister Gladys in California, Wed. 11 Nov. 1942:- “Dear Gladys. Doug and I spent last weekend with Wes and Leola. Mostly we visited, talked about you, the war - how it could be won, etc., and hunted pheasants. We did a lot of hiking, falling over fences and ditches, but we did get our limit. Surely had a good time. Wes is one grand fellow - heart as big as a house! Leola has developed a fast heart - really quite worried about her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The biggest thrill was the deer we shot. We brought home five birds, Wes, the cutie, put three extra birds in our car for mother. The older I get the more I appreciate our wonderful brothers. They are all so different and so lovable. Couldn’t help but think how you would have enjoyed the trip with us. - Love, Grace.”</p>
