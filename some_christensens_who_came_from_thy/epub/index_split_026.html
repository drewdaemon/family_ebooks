  <h2 class="calibre9" id="a-clear-call">A CLEAR CALL</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Else had not accompanied her husband’s people to the temple excursion that November 1888, for she was busy with the sick. Though she longed to go there in behalf of her own departed loved ones she had so little knowledge and such incomplete information about them that she was completely unprepared for this noble service. Even that which she knew of her very own parents was scant indeed. These things tugged at her mind and hung heavily on her heart, but she had so few free moments it seemed. Letters to her people in Denmark for genealogical material had been most unrewarding—they were seldom if ever answered. Else was well aware of the statement made by the Prophet Joseph Smith that—“The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.” She wanted to keep the commandments above all else. She must try harder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So towards the end of that year she wrote again to her sisters and brother in Denmark, sending them Yuletide greetings together with a carefully worded request for additional information on their parents and also on their own families. She mailed these letters with a sincere prayer in her<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-311" title="311"></span> heart. It would likely take months to receive answers - if she ever did. Meanwhile she went courageously on with her work of raising her family, including the sickly little Ada, ushering new babies into the world and succoring the distressed. But her mind was often turned to her kindred.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What happiness was hers when she received the following communication from Denmark (as translated from the Danish<sup class="calibre11" id="fnref:8"><a href="index_split_118.html#fn:8">8</a></sup>):—</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">Thorsted, Denmark - March 1889.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Jens Mikkelsen Skaarup born 11 Feb. 1873; Ane Marie Mikkelsen Skaarup born 22 Feb. 1874, died when three weeks old; Kristen Mikkelsen Skaarup born 4 May 1875; Hans Tavsen Mikkelsen Skaarup born 1 Feb. 1877; Johannes Mikkelsen Skaarup born 28 July 1878; Kristian Mikkelsen Skaarup born 27 Jan. 1880; Frederik Mikkelsen Skaarup born 3 Jan. 1882; Otto Mikkelsen Skaarup born 12 Mar. 1883, died when five days old; Maren Mikkelsen Skaarup born 2 Apr. 1884; Holger Mikkelsen Skaarup born 16 Oct. 1885; Svend Mikkelsen Skaarup born 19 Jan. 1887. — Yes, dear sister, I have given you the names and birthdates of all of our children which are the best we own. We and you of course have the same number. They are all well and so I can do nothing else but marvel at seeing them. I was with Mads and Stine and we decided that I should write alone this time so that the letter wouldn’t be too fat. I am to greet you from them and say from Mads that he will do what he can to accomplish what you require from him. They will each write in a few days.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Sister Marie is moving to Thisted and she will have a good amount of work. Stine lives in Thisted. Her husband is named Svend Poulsen. He is a carpenter and they have six healthy, delightful children and two dead. Mads also has six but they have had ten. He lives in Tingstrup, Thisted Parish, and they have two good dwellings. In the summer they live in Thisted.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Our father died 10 May 1878. When mother was dead he sold the house but kept that little room in Nørhaa, but he spent a lot of his time here with us. The last time he left here he wasn’t very well. He lay in his bed most of a month after. Mikkel<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-312" title="312"></span>and I drove over to Nørhaa to see him two days before he died. He was very sick but he was happy and contented, so I have the best of hope for him. And now I will close for this time. When your letter came the teacher Carl was here. He was going to travel to America in April to visit two of his brothers who lived here for eighteen years. I asked him, after I read your letter, if he would visit my sister in America.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Love from Mikkel and Karen Skaarup</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">It was almost a month before another Danish letter came for Else and her fingers trembled as she opened it:—</p>

  <blockquote class="calibre8">
    <p class="calibre1">Tingstrup, Denmark - April 1889.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Dear Sister:- I have got that done which you asked me to do. I have been to the Priest at Hvidbjerg and he was very good to look back one and one-half centuries but he could hardly go farther as the books at that point were just loose leaves and almost illegible writing. As you can see the mothers of our parents are not mentioned in this information he gave me, which I enclose; only Kristen Kristensen and wife and Kristen Hviid and wife - but I suppose you can remember that father’s mother is Karen and mother’s mother is Else. Our mother died 10 July 1872 and was buried on the 16 and father died the 10 May 1878 and was buried on the 15th.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I shall now tell you a little about what has happened to me in my way through life until now. I suppose that you remember that Kristen, in his last days, was stirred to look inward into his sinful heart and consider the Lord’s goodness to repentant sinners and whatever else there is to believe in. Immediately afterwards we other brother and sisters came in touch with the same way of life initiated by Grundtvig and a revival. I was then at High School on Mors and I was very happy to listen to the lectures which were held, speaking of the lives and experiences of the teachers. This was in the winter of 1868. In the fall I went to High School down by Kilding (Askov Hajskole) and stayed there for six months. In 1875 I came to Thorsted where sister Karen lives, to hold school for some children. There I became<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-313" title="313"></span> acquainted with a girl from Gjaerup, who worked for Karen, and it soon became clear to us that God had led us together. We became engaged the same year and were married on the 25th of May 1876.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On the 18th of March 1877 we had our first son and he was christened and named Askel Hvid (I had by then started to let myself be called Mads Kristjan Hvid.) On the 16th of Feb. 1879 we had our first girl, who was christened Valborg Hvid. On the 11 Aug. 1880 the other girl was born and received in her christening the name of Kirstine Hvid (for mother). On the 24 Oct. 1881 we had a boy, he was christened and called Kristjan Hvid (for father). On the 11 Oct. 1883 another boy arrived and was christened and called Jens Peter but he died at 5 months. On the 5th Nov. 1884 a girl was born. She was christened Marie Hvid but died when ten days old. A few days later my wife took ill and spent her time in bed, partly at home and partly in Thisted, for a year and a half and didn’t have enough strength to turn over in bed by herself. But on Nov. 9th 1885, two little ones came, a boy and a girl. They were christened and called after the other two who had died, Marie and Jens Peter. On 3 Feb. 1888 we had a boy. He was christened Johannes Hvid and he died at five months old. On 22 Feb. 1889 our tenth child arrived, a wonderful girl. She was christened and named after our sister who died, Edel Petrea Hvid. I forgot to mention that the twin, Jens Peter, died at four months of age.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Else Marie Pedersen is my wife’s name. She is now well enough that she got a sewing machine this last winter and sews for all our little ones. Yesterday she got her loom set up and wants to start weaving. It has now been unused for nearly seven years. Our attitude towards the previously mentioned movement, which we were so happy about, is otherwise now than it was before because we think it to be superficial and not serious enough, for these are serious times we are living in. We question if it is the spirit of the world that is leading us or if it is the good Holy Ghost. It seems to me that it appears to be the spirit or power of the world that is ruling. But thank God we believe<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-314" title="314"></span> in an All Ruling God and even if it is dark for us we can sing ‘The Lord is with us’ and we shall fear nothing.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Mads Kristjan Hvid - Tingstrup by Thisted</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">On Tue. 7 May that year of 1889 Christen and Anne went to Manti on another temple excursion and this time Else K. went with them, and of course they took their provisions along and stayed at the campground near the temple. They were in the temple for three days, during which time Else not only assisted the others with the work for some of their departed but had the great joy of being baptized and endowed for her own mother, Mette, and also for Mette’s mother, her own Grandmother Else Andersen (Hvid) for whom she herself had been named. Perhaps it was then, in the beautiful Manti temple, realizing again how little knowledge she really had of her own progenitors, the thought first came to her that she should return to Denmark and search out the records of her dead ancestors as well as those of her living kin, while she yet had her own people in the Old Country. It was a startling idea to say the least. How could it ever be accomplished ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else had hardly been able to take time off from her numerous duties that 7th to 9th of May to go to the temple. Bringing babies alone was a time-consuming business in itself, considering the fact that she often was called to assume almost full responsibility for both mother and babe until the mother herself was up and around again. That May was a busy month for Else K., according to the entries in her medical journal:— “Hans C. Hansen datter 4 Mai 1889; Lars Olsen son 12 Mai 1889; Henry Jensen datter 27 Mai 1889.” Indeed she was a very busy midwife and much in demand, as this journal attested, for she listed in it 36 babies brought by her in the year 1888 and another 36 in 1889 - quite a concidence, but also a record of one of the many, many labors in which she was engaged during those busy years. A good practice, however, made it possible for her to begin to save a little of her income for the future,<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-315" title="315"></span> whatever that future held.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">While Else was busy with her medical practice, Laurs took a great deal of the responsibility of the family. They nearly always had a hired girl and especially one, Christine or “Sena” Lund of Manti, who had been born near Else’s hometown in Denmark and come across the plains with them in the Abner Lowery Company as a very small child. Else and Emma too were getting big enough to help some, especially with the little girls, Elvena and Ada. But that they missed Else in the home is a certainty, according to the son Albert:— “Our home was always a place of love and peace. Contention and quarreling were uncommon. While father was a patient, kind and affectionate father, our mother was the life and soul of the home. As a child, when I had been away and returned, if mother was not in the livingroom or kitchen I would wander from room to room and if I could not find her I would leave; the house seemed too lonely and empty without her. Mother’s complete confidence in me and the rest of the children was a shield to us against dishonorable things.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laurs was also away from home at times, herding sheep, working on the railroad, freighting, etc., to bring in a little extra, but mostly he farmed on his forty acres or worked about the place in Gunnison. They had pigs, chickens, geese, a few sheep, cows and horses, with the pens, sheds and coops to house them. They had a good sized patch of alfalfa on their place, a few plum trees and currant bushes, but their pride and joy was a large, well-kept garden which supplied so much of the family’s food. Laurs always ploughed and got the ground ready each year and helped plant it and irrigated, but it was Else’s garden and she was a fine gardner. She weeded, tended and fussed over the garden and tried to have the first new potatoes, green peas, green onions, and radishes each year, and she usually did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most of the people in Gunnison had wells by 1887 and Laurs was determined to have one on his place. His son Albert tells how he got the well, in his memoirs:— “At first we used water<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-316" title="316"></span>from the open ditch the same as the neighbors. I well remember when my father arranged to have a well dug a little west of the old house and northwest of the new. He showed Mr. William Wasden where he desired the well to be, but Mr. Wasden wanted to be sure that the place selected was a place where water could be found, so he held in front of him a forked limb, one hand upon each prong and the main stick pointing directly in front of him. He walked over to the place where father had located the site of the well. This was on a rather high area above the old home and the land sloped eastward from here. He said that the stick failed to indicate that there was water to be found there. He walked all over the lot to the north and whenever he got near the north boundary the end of the stick would point, indicating (to him) the presence of water. Father went about his work. Other members of the family, including myself, were interested observers. Finally Brother Wasden approached father to render his decision. He said it would be useless to dig the well at the place indicated by him. After some discussion father said he didn’t care where the water was, he wanted the well dug at the place he had suggested in the beginning. Brother Wasden protested, stating that there would be no water there. ‘I don’t care where the water is father repeated, ‘here is where I want you to dig the well!’ That finally settled the matter and Wasden, with apparent forebodings, started to dig the well as directed. It was rather a slow process as it was necessary, after the first few feet, to dig through rock. In the course of weeks, however, Wasden had dug to about thirty feet when to his great amazement, almost consternation, water gushed forth in a veritable stream so that it became impossible to sink the well farther. Wasden cleaned out the well as best he could and then was windlassed out of the hole with his tools. The well soon had some six to eight feet of water in it, ample for all of our domestic uses. That well served the family as long as any of us lived there. As far as I know it may still be there yet.” Gunnison water with its strong mineral taste was supposed to be rich in magnesium, said to be most healthful for people.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-317" title="317"></span> It was not until about 1910 that most people there had water piped into their houses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Christensen’s new home in Gunnison was a block west of the Relief Society Hall, which building had been started in 1877. In June the foundation had been laid on the northwest part of the public square. The main hall, 30 by 60 feet, had walls 2 ft. thick and 16 ft. high. This part was finished in time to hold Sabbath meeting in it the first Sunday in December. A two-story 12 by 20 ft. “T” was completed later on the north end of the hall and provided a stage and, on the second floor, a long assembly room which was used for various church meetings as well as school. The sisters gleaned wheat, gathered “Sunday eggs”, made quilts and other articles to raise money. They paid $1,300 on the erection of their hall and another $1,000 to help build a storage granary and fences. Some material was donated by the brethren. The upper room had seven windows, five facing north and two facing south. Four long rows of benches extended the entire length of the room and in the middle was a large pot-bellied stove and an oversized woodbox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This place of church meetings was completed by the time the Christensens had moved back to Gunnison in 1880 and was especially convenient for them after the they moved to west Gunnison. Besides all Sunday meetings, the Priesthood met Saturday afternoon and night there, the Relief Society held monthly meetings, the Young Ladies Retrenchment Society met twice a month and the Young Mens Mutual met weekly. Prayer meeting was held on Thursday nights and Scandinavian meeting Wednesdays. The adult and juvenile choirs each practiced one night a week and one night was for amusements.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, 15 Nov. 1889, Laurs and Else Christensen and their three oldest sons, Christian 22, Andrew 20 and Joseph 18½, went to the Manti Temple together for the purpose of being sealed together as parents and children for all eternity. The three had not been born in the covenant as had the others of the Christensen children, so it was necessary that this sacred ordinace be performed<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-318" title="318"></span>in their behalf. This was done in all solemnity by Manti Temple President Daniel H. Wells. It must have been a soul-filling experience for each of them. For Else herself, who was not yet sealed to her own parents, it may have been a strong reminder of her unfulfilled responsibilities to her kindred dead. In fact each new visit to that beautiful edifice must have given new impetus to her dream about returning to her native land in search of the genealogical records of her people, past and present. Though she had a great responsibility to the living she also must have felt the urgency of her responsibility to her dead growing within her bosom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That she discussed these things with Laurs and even with their older children, may readily be imagined. She may not have discussed with them, however, her recurring dream that perhaps she herself might be instrumental in bringing her own people the message of the Gospel. This thought she could not banish. As the days and weeks sped, what had begun as little more than a dream began to shape itself into a possibility. As she began to view a trip back to Old Denmark it began to loom as an almost staggering undertaking. But even as Else weighed the situation and prayed for guidance in overcoming the problems, she began making tentative plans to go. The voice of her own destiny was being heard amid the din.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Inquiries were made about the cost of such a journey, for money was a big consideration. Though business for her had been good the past few years and she had saved some, she would still be forced to borrow additional. Passport requirements were investigated. Fortunately she was an American, she and Laurs having secured their Certificates of Citizenship the same day (20 Feb. 1882) in the First Judicial District Court of the United States, Utah Territory, issued at Manti. Else talked to returned Danish missionaries - “yes”, they advised her, “Saints going back to the Old Country on visits often traveled there with Outgoing Elders.” Laurs and the children encouraged her in every way possible - they could take care of things at home they agreed. Having gone this far Else decided<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-319" title="319"></span> she had better write to Karen and Mads about the possibility of a homecoming - and to Stine and Marie. Would she be welcome among them there in Denmark?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Well before an answer came back definite plans for Else’s trip were under way. She had applied to the church authorities in Salt Lake City for permission to travel with any missionaries who might be leaving for the Scandinavian Mission sometime in September 1890, after most of the children would be settled in school. The oldest daughter Elsie had agreed to remain home from school that year and thirteen year old Emma had promised to help, especially with small Elvena. Of course Laurs would be on hand and a woman could be brought in to help, if necessary. The photograph for Else’s passport had been taken, and since it had been definitely decided that she should take along their foster daughter Ada, she too was in the picture. There was no other way but to take the little two-and-a-half year invalid with her, for she had made a solemn promise to the dying Sarah Madsen that she would care for her child, and the little girl was far too frail to leave to the chance care of others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then a letter came from Else’s youngest sister, the twenty-eight year old Marie - still unwed (translated from the Danish):— “Thisted, 15 July 1890. Dear Sister Else: Thank you very much for your letter and thanks because you are thinking of visiting us. We cannot measure the joy it will bring to us. I have sometimes said, ‘I wonder if Else won’t come and surprise us?’. ‘No’ the others have said, ‘that could absolutely not be!’ But look now if it hasn’t almost happened. We had thought it would almost be too big a surprise and so avoided the disappointment in that way. But now my dear, dear sister, we sometimes imagine the moment when you shall come and then believe me we are filled with joy - but then when you leave again it will be hard. You must tell Kristjan hello for us and say that we think he is magnificent to give you, his wife, the liberty to make such a journey - and may the good Lord bless him for it. And if it so be that it<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-320" title="320"></span> comes true, then we will make it as pleasant as we can for you and make sure you get safely home again to the far west, for that is where you belong. Yes, may the Lord give you strength and courage so that this fall will bring you good woman here.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“The old ones want to live until you come; namely Niels Vorup and Kristen Larsen of Nørhaa. Yes, here is joy all over at the thought of your homecoming. I have so many greetings for you! June 6th I went to Hordum to visit Aunt Maren. She takes care of one of the officials ‘Sognefogeden’ in the Parish there. While there I also went to ‘Old Aunts’ and then, since Maren had told me that Mette, who is married to Jens Krog of Spaels, had hurt her thigh, I decided to visit her also. The following day I went through Nørhaa and although I hadn’t been there since not long after you were here, I still could recognize everything. I went to Kjallerup to see Kristen and Maren Hvid and got these names I am enclosing for you. They said to tell you hello. I then went to Mette’s. She is a little better but still in bed. She has four sons and a daughter. One son, Anders, lives in the home for poor people. He is married and has five children, although I think his wife is a little strange. Another son is a bricklayer and lives at Thyholm and one is a grocer in Copenhagen. One son is at home to help Jens Krog. The daughter, Ane Marie, is twenty-eight years old and a nice, good girl and so clean and happy. She went with me to Lavst Lykkes, for I wanted to tell Kristine about you. She said to send you her love. She has been quite broken down with sorrow. They have had four children but about three years ago one boy in his fourteenth year was drowned down in a brook. Then a little girl died and now they have only a boy and a girl. It has struck her hard. Lavst has been sick for sometime with an abdominal infection and she worries about that too, as he has it so often. Her husband is from Svendborg but this year he has bought Uncle’s whole house so now they are living in Aarup. I visited them on my way home for I wanted to go by train from Snested to Sjoring; for now we have trains in Jutland you know. One runs from Thisted to Struer - the stations are Thisted, Sjoring, Turbol, Snested, Hordum, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-321" title="321"></span>Bedsted, Hurup, Ydby, Lyngs, Hvidbjerg and Oddesund du Nord. However the train runs so slow you almost get places as fast when Mikkel Skaarup delivers his meat by horse.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Yes, you can believe it will be nice when you come and I guess I am the one who can, best of all, close my door and go with you - so you shouldn’t be so anxious to get me married off! But believe me little Else, I have had my part of trials and tribulations but these can wait to be told until we can be together in a short while, if it may happen. But I have lived as rich a youth as is granted only a few. I have enjoyed a good life ever since my earliest childhood and I will continue to the end. I pray the Lord every day that he will give me strength and that he will lead me, whether it be through married or single life.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">“Tell Kristjan (they called Laurs that) ‘Hello’, we would like to know him personally. Karen has a good spacious cottage. There is room for much good at a place like that - it is the best place I know. I have spent many happy days there. But you must not think anything else but that sister Stine’s and brother Mads’ homes are happy and pretty too. It is fortunate that you write on good paper for believe me your letters are getting read diligently. You apologize for your letters without reason, but ours need tolerance. It makes us and many others happy that you remember your native language so well. We are all fine. I do not know if they will all write this time, if so their letters should come today so they can be sent together. You have all come closer to us lately. My address is - Cook Marie Andersen, c/o Bricklayer Hansen, Stationsvejen No. 310, Thisted, Jutland, Denmark.”</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Else’s eyes were wet long before she had finished this letter. All the homesickness of a quarter of a century welled up within her and spilled over. Oh to hear the sound of the sea and taste its salt on her lips again - to greet her sisters and brother Mads once more - to lock arms and walk and talk with them as of yore - to sit together in the quiet of the evening and watch the moon come up out of nowhere! But there was<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-322" title="322"></span> little time then for reminiscing and less for weeping, so much had to be accomplished in so short a time. She delivered four babies in July and another four in August, including one more son to the oft bereaved Sena and Anthony Madsen, 28 Aug. 1890. In September she delivered another little one, a son, to one Jens Madsen, then she set aside her brown kit for a time in favor of a small trunk and a large valise, well packed for a three months trip to Little Denmark. And then the time had flown, last minute advice was in order all around and goodbys were being said. Did three-and-a-half year old Elvena cry and cling to her departing mother, finding it difficult to understand why she should be left at home while two-and-a-half year old Ada was being taken along?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whether Laurs took Else, little Ada and their luggage by wagon to Salt Lake City to join the group of L. D. S. missionaries with whom they were to travel, or whether he dropped them off at the nearest railroad terminal at Indianola, we are uncertain - probably the latter. Nevertheless the two joined the group of thirteen Elders who left Salt Lake City by eastbound train just prior to mid-September 1890, which included the following brethren: Edward H. Andersen of Ogden; Jens N. Hansen, John O. Rosenkrantz and Pehr Cronquist of Logan; Harold F. Lilenquist and Michael Johnson of Hyrum; Peter H. Sorensen, Jens H. Kofoed and Thor C. Nielsen of Brigham City; Pehr N. Pehrson of West Jordan; Andrew Hansen and Andres C. Johnson of Pleasant Grove, all from Utah, and Christian H. Poulsen of Franklin, Idaho. These were more than a third of the total thirty-six missionaries who left Zion to serve in the Scandinavian Mission that entire year of 1890.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It should be remembered that the past few years in Zion had been a period when the great anti-polygamy drive had been gaining momentum among the enemies of the Church, and at its height had taken on more the appearance of an anti-Mormon crusade. Having commenced in earnest in 1884, under cover of the Edmunds law, it had been carried on from then with great hostility and increasing vigor, not only by individuals and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-323" title="323"></span>anti-Mormon groups but by Federal officers and courts in Utah and Idaho as well. Arrests and imprisonments in the hundreds each year had continued unabated. The fines collected were enormous. The Utah Penitentiary had been constantly filled with the brethren who were found guilty of infractions of the anti-polygamy laws. Under provisions of the Edmund-Tucker act, the government had taken possession of the Church offices and a wholesale confiscation of Church property threatened. In fact, the question of whether or not the Church could be robbed of its property by the government had even been laid before the supreme tribunal of the country; and also the question of whether its individual members could be robbed of their civil and political rights because of their religious beliefs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The close of the year 1889 and beginning of 1890, political developments in Salt Lake City became highly demonstrative. The Liberal Party, representing the anti-Mormon population, began carrying on a most vigorous and at times vicious campaign against the Church in general, but more particularly the incumbent Peoples Party, which was supported by the Saints. Truly the political pot was boiling in Utah the beginning of the year 1890. The election was held of 10 February 1890 and we turn to historian Andrew Jenson’s Church Chronology to find out how at least the Saints felt about it:— “The municipal election in Salt Lake City, for which so much planning had been done, resulted in victory to the Liberals who, through the grossest frauds, managed to obtain possession of the City government… Sat. 15 Feb. - Ex-Judge Orlando W. Powers was banquetted by the Liberals in Salt Lake City and presented with $10,000 as a reward for manipulating the Liberal municipal campaign… Wed. Feb. 19 - There was a grand Liberal jollification with parade and fireworks held in Salt Lake City.” Thus the civil control of Salt Lake City, as was also true of Ogden and a few other Utah communities, passed from the hands of the Peoples Party to those of the Liberal Party, or anti-Mormon element; and even before the tumult and shouting died, nearly all the civil rights left to the Saints were<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-324" title="324"></span>threatened by anti-Mormon legislation. And so things stood in the “Promised Land” as Else and little Ada joined the company of missionaries who left Salt Lake City, Utah bound for Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That the impact of this situation in Zion should have been felt in far-off Scandinavia seems unusual, nevertheless it was, according to Albert L. Zobell Jr., in his “Under the Midnight Sun”, from which we quote:— “The enforcement of the anti-polygamy laws against the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had its effect in the Scandinavian countries, especially after the American Ambassadors and Counsels abroad received their instructions not to extend any protection to American citizens who were engaged in missionary work in the interest of the Church. The civil authorities on the island of Bornholm, Denmark, were the first to issue edicts of banishment against the Elders and others followed, including those in the city of Aalborg. Scurrilous articles were published in Copenhagen newspapers and those in Bornholm and other places, slandering the Saints and their doctrines. Lutheran Priests gave illustrated lectures against the Church and anti-Mormon stories could be heard on every hand. Anton H. Lund, then President of the Scandinavian Mission, called on the United States Minister in Denmark and asked him if American citizens could be banished from that country without a trial, as they had been. He received little satisfaction in the answer, “I believe they can; there is some law that gives them arbitrary power to expel foreigners.” So even abroad the Saints were not protected; it began to look as if the Elders from Zion would not be permitted to continue their missionary work in Denmark since the government had decided to banish them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The year 1889 had begun with new mobbings and threatened violence to the Mormon missionaries and their congregations. More of the Elders were advised to leave the country, and did. But on the whole the intelligent Danish citizens, and even most of the Danish authorities, knew well that the Danish Saints were a loyal and law-abiding people, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-325" title="325"></span>sustaining the government and taking no part in the political agitations of the day. This went a long way in finally convincing the authorities that banishment of the Elders was not in keeping with the general spirit of freedom of which the Danes were intensely proud. And so it stood in Denmark when the group of travelers from Salt Lake City, including Else K. Christensen, reached Copenhagen 28 Sept. 1890.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of their number, Elder Edward H. Anderson, immediately succeeded Brother Fjeldsted as President of the mission there. Elders Thor C. Nielsen and Andrew Hansen were appointed to labor in the Aalborg Conference. It was to this area of Jutland that Else herself was going. How different this brisk two-and-a-half weeks trip to Denmark must have seemed to her when compared to the five-months-long journey of twenty-four years before, when she had left there and gone west by sailing vessel and oxdrawn wagon train. Though she traveled “3. Klasse” on the east-going ocean liner, her accommodations must have seemed almost “regal” when compared with those afforded by the “Old Kenilworth” of long ago.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We cannot help but be amazed when we think of this courageous, undaunted woman, now nearing her forty-fourth year, going forth with a sickly child on one arm and her bulging handbag on the other, directing the disposition of her other luggage as she transfered from American train, to steamship, to Danish train, canal boat or ferry, as the case demanded, or cared for the food requirements and other personal needs of little Ada and herself as well. Did her mind sometimes find time to dwell on prospective answers she might give to her Danish kinfolk when they asked about Mormon polygamy? She knew well that her relatives would be “up on things”. She would have to face the issue as squarely as possible. We wonder how long it was before she learned that four days before her company had landed in Copenhagen, on 24 Sept. 1890, President Wilford Woodruff, under divine inspiration, had issued his famous “manifesto”, advising the Saints “to refrain from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-326" title="326"></span>contracting any marriage, forbidden by the laws of the land”, and also that the same had been accepted by the unanimous vote of the Saints in attendance at the semi-annual conference of the church, Oct. 6 that year in Salt Lake City.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How wonderful for her to be in Old Denmark once again… Land of red flags with white crosses whipping in the October breeze in every public square and from every sailing craft upon the many waters… Land of amber, green seawashed islands, blue fjords and bays… Ancient land of her fathers, even back to the Vikings of Old… Land of the beautiful Limfjord which caressed the eastern coast of Thy… Land of bells ringing from towers and churches! The only church bell ringing in all of Sanpete Valley, U.S.A., as far as Else K. was aware, was the one now hanging in the belfry of the new Presbyterian Church in Gunnison. She missed bells.</p>
