# ACKNOWLEDGMENT
<span id="page-iii"></span>

I desire to record my appreciation to a few
of the numbers of people on whom I have depended
for information and inspiration in the writing of
this book, without whose assistance it might never
have been accomplished. MANY THANKS. . .
First of all to my patient husband, Daniel M., for
time and quiet in which to write, and any and all
else I desired of him; to my children and brothers
and sisters for their confidence in me; to my many
wonderful Christensen cousins who have so willingly
helped; to a nephew, Bryce Christensen, for trans-
lations, etc.; to a native Dane, Gunnar Christensen,
for advice on Denmark; to a friend, Evelyn Lord,
for typing and forebearance; to certain individuals
who have written about Denmark, particularly the
Danish author Palle Lauring for his "A History of
the Kingdom of Denmark", as well as former
Church Historian, Andrew Jensen, for his "History
of the Scandinavian Mission", from each of which
I have gleaned much information and quoted freely;
and last but not least, thanks to Ib Permin of Andr.
Fred. Host & Son of Copenhagen, Denmark for
permission to use excerpts from the English trans-
lation of Mr. Lauring's book, published by that company.

# PREFACE
<span id="page-v"></span>

The record of forty-years has been inscribed
on the Scroll of Time since I first became interested
in the history of our Christensen family. As I look
back now it seems to be inevitable that I should
write this history. I was driven to it by urgings
beyond my own. Several experiences, three of
which I relate here, have highlighted my interest
and spurred me on.

Shortly after the death of Grandfather Laurs
Christensen, his and Else K. Christensen's joint
Temple Record Book came unexpectedly into my
keeping. From time to time I thumbed through
its well recorded pages noting the lists of dates,
names and places. Vital statistics about unfamiliar
people can seem dead and uninteresting; yet, to me,
each browse through the record spiced my enthusiasm.
I experienced a growing awareness that I
was somehow deeply involved in those strange
Danish names and places. Being a frequent pro~
crastinator, however, I put the book aside during
lengthy intervals. But that tenacious feeling of
involvement and responsibility persisted.

Another experience affected me profoundly.
I described it in an entry in my journal dated July
7, 1933: "Today has been a glorious day for me!
At 9:00 a.m. I entered the LDS Church Historian's
office in Salt Lake City in hopes of contacting
Assistant Church Historian, Andrew Jenson. I
had been told he had been a passenger on the same
ship that carried my Christensen grandparents and
great-grandparents from Denmark to America in
1866. Upon learning of my mission, Brother
Jenson, then in his 82nd year, greeted me cordially
and said that he remembered my Danish ancestors
well. (He had been fifteen years old when he and
they had come to America together.) He had kept
a day-by-day account of the voyage and had recently
translated it from Danish to English. Although he
was very busy on this day, Brother Jenson turned
<span id="page-vi"></span>
the translation over to me and, seating me at his
desk, allowed me to make a copy of that portion of
his diary pertaining to the voyage. He said that I
would be the first to do so. Brother Jenson produced large maps of Denmark and pointed out
places of interest to me. I thanked him and began
to copy.

Feverishly I wrote. Boundaries between the
past and present seemed to disappear. Day by day,
across the great Atlantic. I experienced with my
precious forebearers all the newness, excitement,
anxieties and sorrows of that difficult and memorable
journey. This was one of the most thrilling
genealogical experiences I had encountered. Only
those who have known the exhiliration of discovery
can appreciate my feelings at being thus "caught
up". I was astonished when they announced it was
4:30 p.m. and closing time.

Again, in the spring of 1958, a little over a
year after father's death (Albert H. Christensen),
the telephone rang. Aunt Myrtle, my dear "second
mother" was on the line. She had been cleaning out
the basement of the old home in Orem preparatory
to offering the house for sale. Midst the clutter
and trash, the coal dust and spider webs, she had
found an old dilapidated brown satchel. Apparently,
upon Grandfather Laurs Christensen's death, some
30 years before, the satchel had been entrusted to
father's care, but very soon found its way into
basement storage and was forgotten. Its contents
were musty and dirty. Aunt Myrtle picked up the
bag gingerly, took it out into the backyard intending
to consign it to the flames of a bonfire already consuming
other discarded rubbish. But something
stayed her hand. She put the satchel on the back
porch. The next morning she made a cursory
examination of its contents but found nothing of
interest to her. At that point she was prompted
to call me and ask if I wanted the dirty old thing.
Did I!

Recessed in its cracked, musty interior were
small journals, old letters in a foreign language,
and precious documents of the past, glimpses into
<span id="page-vii"></span>
the lives and activities of loved ones long departed.
Preserved by the kind hand of Providence.

Several weeks later, when eighty-seven year
old Aunt Elsie Bartholomew came to visit, I placed
the satchel on the rug in front of her without a word
of explanation. "Why my goodness," she exclaimed
excitedly, "that's mother's old kit! I haven't seen
it for sixty years. That's the kit mother used to
keep her medical instruments in. It sat by her
bedroom door day and night for years and years,
always packed and ready at a moment's notice
whenever a call came for her to go tend the sick
or dying, or to bring another baby into the world."

When I received the "kit" it contained no
medical instruments, but things far more precious
to me. Apparently, after Grandmother's doctoring
days were over, the "kit" had become the depository
for her treasures. There were old Danish letters,
some over seventy years old, from Grandmother's
three sisters, one brother, and others of her relatives
in Denmark.

I want it thoroughly understood that the second
part of this book is the story of Grandmother Else's
childhood and youth, of which we have known so
little; for while she could have told it herself we
were not listening. I have taken the liberty to put
it into dramatic form, interweaving fact with
fiction - binding fiction together with many facts.
The Danish letters helped so much with this. I
feel that Grandmother Else K. was a great character
and we will probably remember her best if
we bring her to life during this period of her
existence. To my knowledge I have not altered
the truth in any degree. The historical background
can be well documented. The characters
are real. If I have offended any I hope to have
the opportunity to apologize.

I cannot claim that there are no errors in
this book. The writing itself has taken me over
two-and-a-half years. Some writers have been
censured for overlooking unconsciously or intentionally
the darker dissonances of their subjects.
I have tried to present both sides.

<span id="page-vii"></span>
Those of us who are living today are witnessing
the birth of a new era. A far different era than
the one our parents and grandparents knew. The
era into which we were born is about to pass away.
I recall the words of the educator, Max Rafferty:
"Today the hammer of accelerating time is beating
on the great anvil of the world with ever increasing
brashness and insistency. Sparks are flying from
the whole surface. The point of no return is past."

We are indeed approaching a very new and
different world - a challenging world - a wonderful
world - a frightening world; and in this new world
the Christensens who are left have a great heritage
as well as a significant responsibility. As I have
assembled material for this book my appreciation
and love for my cousins, relatives and Christensen
progenitors has increased an hundred fold. If I
were to dedicate this book, however, it would be
to my children and grandchildren with deepest
affection. I am proud and grateful to have been
able to contribute a few measures of understanding
to the lives of those who are to follow. We must
all go forward with firm resolve, devotion and
courage to make this a better world.

## THERE IS A LOVELY LAND

The title for this chapter, about the birth-land
of our cherished progenitors, was borrowed
from the pen of Adam Ochlenachlager, Denmark's
National Poet, who wrote one of this country's
national anthems and called it by that name.

DENMARK--A sea-washed kingdom of some 500
green islands (483 to be exact) 100 of them inhabited
the others not; and thrown in for good measure, a
ragged-coasted head-and-neck of land jutting northward
from Germany, called the Jutlandic Peninsula,
or "Jutland". (It was in Denmark's Jutland, the
most northwestern part sometimes called Thyland
or "Thy", that our Danish Christensens were born.)
Denmark, the smallest of the Scandinavian countries
and Europe's smallest kingdom, is often called
"Little Denmark". Her total land area is 16,576
square miles--about twice the size of our State of
Massachusetts. There is nothing particularly
spectacular about the land itself except for some
dazzlingly white chalk cliffs, the so-green of its
ever-green islands, and the unusual sculpturing of
its varying coastline, 4,620 miles in length. The
terrain is mostly gently rolling with some woods
and hilly areas, particularly in Jutland, where the
highest point, "Heaven Mountain", reaches upward
about 600 feet; which may seem insignificant to
"Rocky Mountain folks" but is undoubtedly quite
impressive to low-land Danes when viewed from a
valley two feet below sea level. The country is
<span id="page-2"></span>
totally surrounded by sea, except where Jutland's
broad neck joins Germany, and broken apart by
numerous water courses the three largest being
the "Sound", "Great Belt" and "Little Belt". As
if these weren't enough, the surface is so studded
with lakes, coves, bays, canals and fjords that one
wonders how any land has been able to survive at
all amidst all that water! But the pleasant land is
there nevertheless, holding up its proud head above
the ever-lapping of the hungry sea.

Denmark, primarily a farming kingdom,
devotes 75% of the land to agriculture and 9% to
forestry, while 8% is occupied by moors and dunes,
with most of the remainder being built up into villages
and cities, large cities being comparatively
few in number. There is no mineral wealth but the
soil is fertile and, as reported in 1950, produces
three times as much grain per acre as is grown in
the U. S. A. The climate is a study in extremes,
with the long snows of its dark winters and the
"shimmering half-light-at-midnight" of its short
but bright summers. There is always wind, particularly
in northwestern Jutland, fierce off the cruel
North Sea in winters, caressing in summers--but
wind enough to turn a mill or lift a sail any day.
But it is not the formation nor the performance of
the land that beckons and invites one to these faraway
shores. The great charm of the "Little
Kingdom of Denmark" lies in the people who possess
her: their character, their customs, the manner in
which they have dressed the land; and also--and
perhaps to an even greater extent--to the colorful
history of her past, reminders of which can be seen
all around the land today.

The Danish people, subjects of a constitutional
monarchy since 1849, are at present about 4,500,000
in number. In the neighborhood of 26% of these live
by agriculture, 32% by industry, and a good part of
the remainder by fishing, shipping, handicrafts and
tourist service (this latter growing each year). This
was not so in earlier Denmark, when most everyone
lived by farming and fishing and a few by trade.

Even the richest nobles maintained close contact
with the soil, as well as with shipping. The country
is far more commercialized today, although
<span id="page-3"></span>
agriculture is still the backbone of its economy.
Though the Danes export many products, such as
porcelain, linen, glassware, silver, furniture,
fish, etc., their milk, butter, cheese, ham and
eggs, all products of their specialized agriculture,
are the most important. They help to feed Europe
and some even find their way into American kitchens.
Even though they export the best of their dairy pro-
ducts, the Danes eat well and are likely the best
fed European peoples today. They are not wealthy
(there are comparatively few millionaires in Denmark)
but they attain comfort if they fall short of:
riches. These people are fairly well educated,
since Denmark is one of Europe's best instructed
countries; there is no illiteracy there. Compulsary
education, introduced in 1814, was reinforced
thirty years later by Bishop Grundtvig's famous
"Folk High Schools", which still exist. These aim
to train adult students in the literature, history,
georgraphy and culture of their own land, and also
in the art of living. Many Danes can speak English
(or think they can).

On the far-east coast of the island of Zealand
lies the city of Copenhagen, of "Kobenhavn", mean-
ing merchants-haven. It was a small fishing and
trading village until 1536, when it became capitol
of the realm. Now one of Europe's loveliest
capitols and a center of culture for all Scandinavian
peoples, it is also Denmark's largest city by far,
housing nearly one-fourth of her entire population,
including the present Danish King Frederick IX and
the royal family. Copenhagen is situated on a
beautiful harbor, over which presides Denmark's
finest bronze statue, "The Little Mermaid" sitting
on her rock, a docking place for multitudes of
great and small ships and crafts of all kinds,
bringing in products from all over the world.
But Copenhagen, despite her growing cosmopolitan
leanings and her accumulation of much that is
geared to the tastes of ultra modern sophisticates,
is still very much of a Danish city, with her old
spires, towers, statues, palaces, churches,
bridges, and harbor canals--some dating to the
Renaissance. With typical Danish ingenuity the
Danes have managed to maintain here, as elsewhere
in their land, the image of 'Old Denmark".

<span id="page-4"></span>
Danish men and Danish women are not easily
swayed or changed; they seldom lose their identity
or their moorings. This seems to be one of their
outstanding characteristics. They go about their
business with cool-headed confidence in themselves
and their country. They give the impression that
they know where they are going and how to get
there! Obviously, Danes are not all alike; but
though there are numerous classifications and
varieties, there seems to be only one name-brand:
"Deep Down Danes". They cling to their land,
their homes and families, their friends, their
purposes and traditions with a steadfastness that is
gratifying in this fly-by-night age. However, it
would be a mistake to think of them as a somber
people--they are anything but that. They are
best known for their gaiety and hospitality. Any
harshness of their lives is well cushioned with that
rare Danish humor for which they are so famous.
It is easier to think of the Danes as one big family
rather than a nation; for of all the European peoples
they seem to be the most domestic, friendly and
uncommonly happy - and especially so out in the
countryside.

And how the Danish people, one and all, love
to celebrate! Every holiday or special occasion
calls for a "festival"; their lives are literally
punctuated with them: family festivals, village
festivals, State festivals; festivals for birthdays,
confirmations, gold and silver wedding anniver-
saries, etc., as well as house-warmings. Not
only is there a festival when the new house is first
occupied but even before, when the rafters are
raised and the roof newly placed, they fly a Danish
flag from tip-top, put a wreath around its pole and
"raise the roof and rafters" all over again! Each
family party includes everyone from Grandma to
baby. With each new festival out come the flags,
the garlands, the open-faced sandwiches, the
coffee and pastries, as well as plenty of good old
Danish beer. People make verses, songs and
toasts to the celebrated and there is as much good
cheer passed around as refreshments. What
matters if present day celebrations are not as
meaningful as those of yore, as long as there are
festivals? The Danes' summers are brief and they
<span id="page-5"></span>
enjoy them to the hilt; everyone moves outside,
The land itself takes on the appearance of a
gigantic festival, with flags flying, bands playing,
and flowers blossoming everywhere: heather on
the moors of Jutland; tulips, vari-colored, on the
island of Funen; potted plants in cottage windows;
cemeteries, hedged all around, purple with pansies;
flowers massed brilliantly in parks and gardens;
balconies bright with blooms on city dwellings;
wreaths and garlands twined everywhere at the
least provocation; red poppies in the fields of
Slesvig and, mingled gaily with all, the flowered
caps of girls. It would be hard to think of Den-
mark without flowers or flags and it would be
equally difficult to think of her without bells. So
often there have been bells ringing in Denmark
from spires and towers: carillons, bells to mark
the hours and to call the congregations to worship;
happy peel of bells for weddings, mournful toll of
bells for dyings; clang of bells calling her sons to
battle--Denmark has had her share of wars.
Flowers are for summers, but bells and flags
are for all seasons in this lovely land of the Danes,

The Danish citizens are patriotic too, displaying
their national banner at every conceivable
opportunity and standing, heads uncovered, in city
squares; singing with gusto as bands play "King
Christian", "Lovely Land", or others of their
country's songs; but it goes far beyond that. The
Danes seem to have sincere affection for their
homeland and a deep sense of national pride,
especially in the storied achievements of Denmark's
venerable past. They are proud of their descent
from the bold Vikings of old who roamed the seas
a thousand years ago, though they themselves are
as peaceable as those marauding pirates of the sea
were fierce. How well these Danish people know
the legends and sagas of their native land, passed
down for generations and told them in their youth.
Who know or cares where fact takes flight and
fantasy begins? Have you heard them tell how
their land got its name? Denmark, or "Danmark"
as the Danes have it, means Dan's Field and was
so named about 900 A.D. after the mythical
Danish champion Hoger Dansker--"who has been
seated asleep for age after age, till the day of fate
<span id="page-6"></span>
awakens him, but whose beard has continued to
grow until it has grown right through the board
(table) where he sits". (There is a statue of him
and his whiskers in Copenhagen.) Or perhaps you
have heard some tell of Denmark's flag, "Dannebrog",
meaning Danes-piece-of-cloth--"blood-red
with cross of white, it came dropping out of heaven
20 June 1219, when the elderly Danish Archbishop,
Anders Sunesen, fell on his knees on a hill during
the Battle of Lyndanisse and prayed for victory--
just the way Moses had done." They speak of the
"Three Year War" a century ago, to save Jutland's
neck, Slesvig, from the German Holsteiners and
of the miracle that happened down there on the
blood-drenched fields; of how every spring then
the red poppies bloomed with white crosses. Such
tales are a rich part of Denmark's heritage, as
are the stories and folk-ballads of her kings and
queens, nobles and peasantry, wars, fleets, and
of the land itself, that reach back-back-back, for
Denmark counts her years in thousands instead of
hundreds.

There is magic in recalling the dignified
glory of her past, as told in song and stone artifacts,
myths and sagas; especially if one's roots
were sprouted and nurtured on her soil for genera-
tions, when the spark of one's own life was even
then within the veins of her ancient peoples. Surely
the liveliest interest and the most human should be
awakened in us of Danish descent, in this tie of
blood and place--this small corner of the earth to
which chance brought our ancestors. Someday, if
one were fortunate enough to find himself contemplating
the story of Denmark's ancient towns,
fields and peoples spread out before his very eyes--in
ramparts of long-idle fortresses; settlements of
stone age men; Viking graveyards and remains of
"long ships" in which these fierce ones raided;
picturesque old castles, monasteries and cathedrals
where storks have built their nests for ages; magnificent
palaces dating to 1600 and beyond, containing
royal tombs, crown jewels and treasures of ancient
kings; low-thatched and timbered cottages, the like
of which inspired the fairy tales of that famous
story teller, Hans Christensen Andersen, --cottages
to which the atmosphere of fairyland still clings;
<span id="page-7"></span>
or if one were to find himself standing in the ancient
city of Nyborg beside Denmark's last surviving
Royal Medieval Castle, where her "Magna Charta"
(Royal Charter) was drawn up and proclaimed in
1282--might not one, with surge of deep emotion,
be led to exclaim in wonderment: "Were my
kinsmen here?"

## WHENCE CAME THIS LAND AND ITS PEOPLE?

Many thousands of years ago there was no
land where Denmark now lies, only sea. But then
time was one with eternity and there was no man to
count the years. Denmark's biography is shrouded
in myth, as is that of other lands. It was once
supposed by early scientists that, out of the vast
sea which covered all, land and mountains sprang
up like veritable "jacks-in-the-boxes". Modern
scientists tell us that the birth of the land was
much more gradual; in fact that it took eons of
time. Future geologists may come up with other
theories, since they are still "digging" for the
truth. However, as of now, we are led to believe
that at the bottom of the sea, where Denmark's
land later emerged, the shells of myriads of sea
creatures piled up during the course of time, their
small white skeletons sinking like a continuously
moving veil and causing layers of resulting chalk-slime
on the sea bed to grow and become hundreds
of feet thick. Thus a massive layer of chalk-like
substance became the foundation of the new land
that rose up beneath the present areas of Denmark
and her closest land neighbors. Indications of this
can be seen today in the "White Cliffs of Dover" in
England, the "Chalk Downs" in France, on the
Island of Riigen, and in several places in Denmark,
particularly the "White Cliffs" on the Isle of M&oslash;en
in the Baltic Sea.

As the great land masses arose the sea
retreated. Then time brought the "Ice Age" and
great glaciers moved over the northland and locked
it in their frigid clutches. No man can tell how
often the ice melted and receded, only to return
and grip the land again, dragging icy fingers over
its surface, clawing out islets, rivers, lakes and
<span id="page-8"></span>
ridges--to lie long under the ancient stars with no
man to name them. When the great ice melted for
the last time, enormous bodies of clay and gravel
were deposited all along the line of its retreat.
But it was ages before the land was finally liberated
and left out to dry in the sunshine. However,
the land was not even then as it is today, for there
was one continuous stretch of it connecting most of
the European continent, Only in the northernmost
part of the present North Sea area was there any
water. All south was land except for a couple of
large rivers flowing northward where the "Belts"
have since appeared. As the atmosphere became
milder this extensive land became covered with
dense coniferous forests, interspersed with rivers,
lakes and swamps, where roamed wild animals,
including reindeer and the mighty Aurochs, long
extinct.

Now a glacier can weigh upwards of 125 tons
per square foot, and when the millions of tons of
pressure was finally released from the crust of
the earth the land began to sink and the sea, fed
by the melting ice, began rising and eating its way
into the land. Then began a great struggle for
supremacy between land and sea. Century upon
century the glutinous sea flung itself in among the
trees, overflowing streams and lakes, washing
away whole areas and sending all creatures fleeing,
panic stricken. Catastrophic storm floods lashed
and beat upon mountains and ridges and descended
in torrents upon valleys and shores, till much of
the land gave way and was lost beneath the roaring
waters. The surface that remained was scarred
and totally changed. Out of the great travail of this
land, Denmark was born, - Jutland and her 500
green islands.

* * * * * * *

The story of prehistoric man is also founded
only in myth. It is supposed that the first humans
to come to this area were reindeer hunters from
central Europe, following the reindeer north as
they followed the retreating glaciers. Then there
came to live throughout the "Nordland" other
hunters from the south, with their families, who
sought their food in the great forests and in lakes
<span id="page-9"></span>
and streams. Undoubtedly life and death to those
primitive peoples depended upon the success of
their hunting and fishing--and the caprice of the
elements. As the land was broken apart and grew
smaller and much of the forest was washed into the
sea, animals became scarcer and the age of the
early hunter was over. The inhabitants, forced
to seek their food mainly in the sea, lived on
oysters, fish and seal meat, etc. Filtering down
through the dimness of the past comes evidence
that there were such fishermen living on Denmark's
ragged shores a few thousand years before Christ.
Remains of hundreds of the settlements of these
early oyster-eating inhabitants have been found
along her coasts. The timing may be wrong but
the existence of such people is a certainty.
Whether they were descendants of earlier hunters
or whether they were newcomers is not known.

As waves of the sea had swept in over this
land called Denmark, altering its contour bit by
bit and age by age, so waves of culture swept in
over its people, molding their lives as they climbed
the great ladder of progress from savagery to
civilization, rung upon rung, About 3000 to
2000 B.C., it is believed, tribes from the south
infiltrated the domains of the oyster-eaters and
brought with them a new form of survival--agriculture!
They taught these people how to raise
their food and domesticate animals, and they
carried with them implements of stone, including
stone axes that meant life to Denmark's first
farmers but death to her remaining forests. Life
there took on new meaning: the sound of axes rang,
trees crashed and new clearings appeared. To
this day flintstone axe blades can be found buried
in the soil all over Denmark and they say there
are not many farms in the country without a few
specimens lying around. In fact, we are told they
have been found in the tens-of-thousands, some
complete with wooden handles. Magnificent great
stone axes and daggers have been found preserved
in bogs and beside corpses in burial tombs of that
"stone age" period. Since it is sincerely believed
and most probable that the majority of present day
Danes are direct descendants of those stone age
people of Jutland and her islands, is it not also
<span id="page-10"></span>
probable that we too have some stone axe swingers
on our family tree?

About 2000-1000 B.C. there must have come
another wave of immigration to Denmark whose
leaders wielded huge battle axes of pure copper,
Likely only the better class peasants could afford
to keep up with the copper axe Joneses since this
costly metal had to be imported from Italy, whose
merchant ships were even then trading along Denmark's
shores. It was during this so-called
"Bronze Age" that the Danes built trading vessels
of their own and went abroad. They had something
more precious to trade than copper, bronze or
gold--a wonderful substance, "sea gold".

For a long, long time the Danes have been
able to pick up from their beaches this stuff they
call "sea gold", but we call "amber". A golden
resin, originating from the ancient coniferous
forests of the area, it gets washed out of the soil
of Germany and into the sea, whereafter it drifts
ashore on Danish coasts, Some gets washed up
from the bottom of the sea and comes to rest on
the west coast of Jutland, In ancient days girls
wore this Danish sea gold in the form of colossal
multiple chains with large center pieces and for
belts, ear rings and other types of ornaments. In
early tombs were found enormous ornaments consisting
of hundreds of amber beads. Danes began
using amber and soon other countries were clamoring
for it. Even the graves were robbed of their
"sea gold" and it was sold to people of the
Mediterranean. Denmark became famous for this
beautiful substance and early sea captains found
their way to the Baltic and took away this treasure
from "Amber-Land" (Basileia) as the Greeks called
Denmark. When Danish ships started trading they
carried furs, fish, flint, and perhaps cattle and
slaves, but first and foremost - amber! During
the bronze age Denmark apparently engaged in
brisk and steady trading, even as far as Egypt,
and became a rich land, Then this seeming paradise
was suddenly shattered by the coming of the
Celts to Europe.

The Celts, a brave war-like people from
Asia Minor, fond of ornaments and fine armor,
<span id="page-11"></span>
came in their chariots, led by Druid priests and,
over-running Greece, Rome and Gual (France)
landed in the British Isles. They became masters
of vast regions but they never managed to force
their way into the north countries. However, they
formed a barrier between Denmark and the south
and west and put quite a "crimp" in her trade.
Though the Celts never came to Denmark, except
perhaps a few to trade or as prisoners of war, the
things they brought with them came - disease and
war. But the Celts also brought "iron" to Europe
in the form of weapons, instruments, chariots and
wares. More durable than stone, cheaper and
more available than copper, the Danes soon
learned to make good use of iron. By more or
less the time of Christ the glory of the "Celtic
Iron Age" had faded, Denmark had resumed her
brisk trading, and Rome set out to conquer the
civilized world.

Caesar's legions marched through Gual and
into the British Isles, and the "Nordland" trembled.
But though the Roman conquerors made England
theirs for 400 years they were never able to penetrate
far into German territory nor up to Denmark
at all. This is one reason why the subsequent
history of the Scandinavian countries and western
Europe is entirely different. True, Rome's merchant
ships continued to sail to Denmark to trade,
but her warriors nor the glory of her great metropolitan
culture never reached there. No stone
houses were built in Denmark during this "Roman
Age"; no Roman roads, bridges, theaters, churches,
or Roman baths, as in other parts of Europe.
Though not a poor country at the time, Denmark's
people looked very poverty stricken in comparison.
Their homes were low, dark, windowless huts with
holes in the purlins to let the smoke out. The
floors were of earth and the huts were divided into
two parts--one for cattle and horses, the other for
human beings, "Only the upper classes wore fine
clothes, brooches and jewelry; ordinary Danes
went about in simple woolen garments or animal
hides - sheepskins for instance,

Finally the Great Roman Empire crumbled
and great troubles descended on the British Isles.
<span id="page-12"></span>
Fierce and cruel Anglo and Saxon tribes from Den-
mark's Jutland and Germany moved upon her shores
(450-500 A.D.). These famising barbarians took
over the country and struck a blow that nearly
wiped out the civilization so painstakingly built up
by early monks and scholars there. This was the
beginning of the period, so marked with turbulence
and intellectual stagnation, known as the "Dark
Ages" or the early "Middle Ages".

Denmark was having her troubles too at the
time. The Roman emperor, Constantine, transferred
his capitol from Rome to Constantinople,
thus dislocating Europe's entire trading system,
Since the real money was in Roman trade, Denmark
had traded in the south for centuries, but all
of a sudden she found that she was no longer in a
favorable position for trade. Trade lines, hereto-
fore moving from north to south, now started to
move from west to east through the Baltic Sea and
thence, via Russian rivers, to the new hub of the
Mediterranean, This led to trouble in Denmark's
waters as her islands became trading stations
enroute and plundering targets for pirates. A
competitive battle began between Denmark and
Sweden, the Swedes being particularly determined
to gain control along Russia's river courses.
Trouble also started for Denmark on her south
Jutland border as hostile Germanic tribes gained
control of some of her territory there, No longer
were Danish tribes permitted to wander at will
down through the continent of Europe by way of
Jutland's neck, as heretofore, A population sur-
plus developed in the land. Trade cut off and
migration stymied, it seemed that the Danes' only
great hope was to take to the sea - and this they
did en masse, together with other Scandinavians,
with the most unusual consequences! The next few
hundred years produced the strangest chapter in
Scandinavian history.

## VIKINGS WERE THEY

In the eighth century something formidable
began to stir in the north countries - the curtain
was going up on that dynamic drama, the "Age of
<span id="page-13"></span>
the Vikings", Bursting upon the scene almost like
spontaneous combustion, raiders in tall-masted
"long ships" shoved off from the coasts of Denmark,
Sweden and Norway, their aim not so much war as
plunder. The concurrent scenes enacted by these
barbarians (let's face it) were backed by no con-
certed plan and no strategic political aims. Every-
thing just erupted in some overwhelming fashion.
"Suddenly the Swedes, in a current of marauding
vigor, struck southward through Russian rivers to
Constantinople". Dano-Norwegians sailed from
Norway to the Mediterranean and harried the
shores of this inland sea. Norwegian buccaneers;
in a far-ranging impulse, sailed to Ireland, Iceland,
and presently across the Atlantic to Greenland,
with Leif Ericksson, son of Eric the Red,
and on to the American continent (long before
Columbus), which they called "Vinland", meaning
Wineland. Danish Vikings rowed along the coasts
and up the rivers of France and England and, leaping
ashore without warning, plundered and burned
villages, farms, estates and convents, taking off
again before word could get around. Like destruc-
tive tornadoes these Vikings swept in all directions,
bearing terror and death, and none could stay them.
"From the rage of the Norsemen deliver us, O
Lord" was the prayer that rose up from far and
near.

What the word "Viking" really means nobody
knows; probably the "men from the fjords", since
Vik in Danish (Vig in Norwegian) means a little
fjord. Danes and Norwegians often joined in their
raids, it was difficult to distinguish between them.
The Viking Age is said to have generally begun
with the attack on Lindisfarne, on the northeast
coast of England, 8 June 793. "This was by no
means the first raid on a French or English coast,
but on this occasion the plunderers' attack was on
a famous English convent, Episcopal residence and
well known seat of learning. Its holy inmates were
killed or dragged off as slaves by these barbarians".
The report sped down through western Europe and
everybody was shocked and horrified - but this was
only a start! In 835 the Viking storm broke with
all its fury; whole fleets, of sometimes 300-400
vessels at a time, launched wholesale attacks,
<span id="page-14"></span>
taking spoils and prisoners. These Vikings seemed
to be completely fearless and without pity, sacri-
ficing their prisoners to their Nordic gods or
selling them as slaves. War was their chief occu-
pation and slaves their chief trade during those
convulsive decades.

One of the most renowned Vikings of all
times was Ragnar Lodbrok, or "Hairy Breeches",
born in Norway but a member of the ruling family
of Denmark. This hero sailed up the Seine in 845,
with 120 ships, ravaging Paris and the country on
both sides of the river. The French King Charles,
who challenged him, was forced to take refuge in
a convent. Charles finally bought him off with
7,000 lbs. of silver ("Danegeld") and Ragnar sailed
home. Next this Viking turned against England's
Northumbria, where he was finally captured by the
King there and cast into a snake pit to die amid a
coiling mass of loathsome adders. Ragnar had
four sons, and as he drew his last breath he
muttered this potent threat: "The little pigs would
grunt now if they knew how it fares with the old
boar". The old Norse legend tells how his sons
received the news: "Ironside gripped his spear
shaft so hard that the print of his fingers remained
stamped upon it. Hvitserk was playing chess but
he clenched his fingers upon his pawn so tightly
that the blood started from under his nails. Siguard
Snake-eye was trimming his nails with a knife and
kept on paring until he cut into the bone; but the
fourth son was the one who counted. Ivar-the-
Boneless demanded to know the precise details of
his father's death and his face became red, blue
and pale by turns and his skin appeared puffed up
by anger".

Ivar was a warrior of command and guile and
he sought bloody revenge. He was the mastermind
behind the Scandinavian invasion of England in 866-67.
His powerful Danish Sea army brought a near
end to the Kingdom of Northumbria and a horrible
death to her king; destroying her dwellings,
churches, and monasteries with fire and sword and
with them masterpieces of Angelican art and the
culture of Bede, Alcium and Caedmon. Nothing
was left but roofless walls. Northumbria never

<span id="page-15"></span>
again acquired any sign of her former greatness,
But Ivar's army didn't stop there - it marched on,
taking East Anglia and into Mercia. "The Vikings,
with their brightly painted shields and banners,
their finery and golden bracelets, made the Saxons
seem modest by comparison. As they slowly
approached their foes they clashed their shields
and weapons and raised long, repeated war cries
as their missiles began to fly".

Other Viking armies returned again and again.
No one knew when or where they would-strike; the
English kings and their armies could not be everywhere
at once. Then the Danes began staying.
longer each year and soon they brought their
families and began taking over the land. During
that century the Danish Vikings literally streamed
into England, until the whole areas of northern and
eastern England and the Midlands became one large
Peasant community called "Danelagh". The raids
and the settling kept up until more than a fourth of
England's inhabitants were Danes - or descended
from them, The threat to England became deadly
Earnest.

Other Vikings went to France and their chiefs
became rulers of sizable areas of Flanders. In
fact, they were on French coasts every single year
and the French king's only resort was to buy them
off with "Danegeld" - but they always returned.
In desperation, in 911, the king granted a Danish
Chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French), Normandy as a
fief on condition that he would protect France from
other Viking invasions. He promised but took it
lightly and Danes continued to raid and settle as
he did. Rolf retained Normandy and his grandson
became the Duke of Normandy, later known as
William the Conqueror, who crossed the channel
and took over England in 1066.

The real soul of the Vikings lay in the,"long
ships", The Scandinavian peoples had succeeded
in creating a craft that for its day was undoubtedly
the finest in Europe. Every detail was the result
of thousands of years spent on the sea. Models of
Such ships have been dug up almost intact, the
most famous in Gokstad, Norway in 1880. "It is
76 ft. 6 inches from stem to stern; 17 ft. 9 inches
<span id="page-16"></span>
amidship; clinker built of solid oak planks fastened
with tree-nails and iron bolts and caulked with cord
of plaited animal hair; with sixteen oars per side,
varying in length between 17 and 19 ft. and beautifully
shaped with the mast 40 ft. high. It could
carry a smaller boat or 'dinghy', a crew of fifty,
and if necessary another thirty warriors or captives,
in all weathers, and could ride out the fiercest
storms of the Atlantic Ocean. Such were the
vessels which in many different sizes bore the
Vikings to the plunder of the civilized world, to
the assault of Constantinople, the siege of Paris,
the foundation of Dublin, Ireland, as well as many
parts of England and the discovery of America".
Their pictures rise before us vivid and bright:
their finely carved dragon-shaped prows; their
high curving sterns; their long rows of shields,
black and yellow, alternately ranging along their
sides - the gleam of steel, the scent of murder.
Yet these super instruments of sea power would
have been useless without the men who handled
them; all were volunteer leaders of marked ability
and as good at the helms or oars as they were with
their swords. We are told that men between 16-60
were chosen but none without atrial of ability and
strength.

And then one came who was able to halt the
on-rushing might of these overwhelming Danish
Vikings, or at least to temper it. Had it not been
so all England would have been put under the yoke
of these plundering settlers. That one was Alfred,
a Saxon king called "The Great", partly because of
his ability to challenge these warriors and sometimes
win. All through the years of his reign King
Alfred's armies and those of the Danish Vikings
waged deadly war, with little to show on either side
much of the time but scars and corpses. Though
it was more than a century after his death before
the Age of the Vikings came to a close, yet he
showed that they could be stopped and pointed the
way whereby his descendants took up the successful challenge.

Sir Winston Churchill, in his chapter on the
Vikings, found in his "History of the English Speaking
Peoples" (Vol. 1) - from which much of this
<span id="page-17"></span>
material on the Vikings has been gleaned - writes:
"When we reflect upon the brutal vices of these
saltwater bandits, pirates as shameful as any
whom the sea has borne, or recoil from their
villainous destruction and cruel deeds, we must
also remember the discipline, the fortitude, the
comradeship and martial virtues which made them,
at this period, beyond all challenge, the most formidable
and daring race in the world. . . From
Yorkshire to Norfolk this sturdy, upstanding stock
took root and thus the bloodstream of these vigor-
ous individualists, proud and successful men of
the sword, mingled henceforward in the English
race, a vivifying, potent, lasting and resurgent
quality".

There is no denying the terror let loose by
the Vikings in western Europe and elsewhere.
Thousands of people were killed or forced into
slavery. Thousands of widows all over Europe
had reason to curse the Vikings of Scandinavia.
But naturally these bloodthirsty expeditions
claimed thousands of Danish lives too, either
slain or drowned; and despite the fact that these
dead had nobody to blame but themselves, the
events as seen from Denmark's side on the homefront
were often dismal enough. And there were
widows in Denmark too, standing along the beaches
every autumn, staring vainly out to sea as ships
returned home - or did not return. Many tombstones
were raised in Denmark for Danes who
never returned with their ships. Kipling caught
the picture in his "Harp Song of the Dane Women":

> "What is a woman that you forsake her
and the hearth-fire and the home-acre
to go with the old grey widow-maker?"

Denmark's adventure of a thousand years ago
may appear as a brief, confused episode to the
descendants of that country called the British
Isles; peopled by ancient Britons, invaded by
Celts, then conquered and occupied by the Romans
for 400 years, then invaded and conquered by
Angles and Saxons, then by Danish Vikings, and
finally by Norman Knights under William the
Conqueror, their origin is so tangled that they
can scarcely be blamed if they are not excited
<span id="page-18"></span>
about where they came from and how. Yet on the
other hand, Danes and their descendants represent
one of the few peoples in Europe that have never
suffered from large-scale invasions or population
transfers. They can really claim, for the most
part, to be descendants of the Danes of the Stone
Age. They can point with pride to the ancient
Vikings, knowing full well that generation after
generation their Danish ancestors have called
Jutland and her islands home! They know they
are of the blood of Vikings and that the romantic
days of the "long ships" were perhaps among their
progenitors' brightest. Perhaps Danes dream of
their great - grandsires "Anders the Ploughman"
and "Christian Red Whiskers" standing at the
prows of high masted ships or rowing at them,
streaking toward Normandy or the British Isles.
Or do they think of their many, many great-grandmothers,
"Karen Lauritzdatter" and "Maren
Christiansdatter" standing on Jutland's beaches as
days begin to chill, gazing out hopefully for signs
of sails? Cannot we too meditate and dream of
these, since we are of the blood of Vikings? Is
it not necessary to know who one really is?

## PEASANTS - NOBLES - KINGS

The basic processes of life go on much the
same in all ages - man lives and loves and mates,
his children are born and he buries his dead. But
oh, how varied is the breadth and depths of living,
how contrasted the quality and color, as each man
seeks his place under the everlasting stars. Living
can be as different as black and white, rough and
smooth, songs of birds, and butterflies wings. No
peoples have actually been the same - no places,
no ages - nor have the influences that have affected
them. Though historians have grouped and catalogued
them, individuals must have always been quite
different, even in Old Denmark, Surely there were
those who led; the in-betweens and on-the-fences;
the aggressive - the rebels - the weak. But whether
richmen, poormen, stone age-men, peasants,
nobles or kings, people as well as nations have had
to learn to get along with each other if they wished
<span id="page-19"></span>
to succeed, or even to survive; thus, during the
seemingly endless process, various forms of
government have evolved.

In ancient Denmark a freedom-inspired,
communal sort of living was the vogue. Independent
farming settlements or tribes were the governing
bodies and individual peasant families the units.
("Peasant" referred to one who worked with the
land, so all "Danes" were peasants to begin with.)
Each settlement had its own tribal councils, called
"Thing" meetings, where decrees were recited
from heart by the "lawman" and peasants discussed
matters and made decisions. All major projects
were on a cooperative basis and each man had his
say and, though some undoubtedly spoke louder
than others, liberty was very much alive! As the
country became more populated men came to think
that "war" was the way to succeed. Settlement
chieftains began fighting each other for desirable
tracts of land that gradually grew into small kingdoms. 
The successful war lords were the forerunners
of the Danish nobility. Before the time of
the Vikings Denmark was pretty well divided into
separate kingdoms, and the greater land holders
had gained the status of "nobles" - there were
likely even those who had set themselves up as
"kings", Nevertheless, the peasants were still
largely in control - they were a stubborn lot and
hard to suppress. Freedom was their heart-throb
from the start!

We have called this land "Denmark" from
the beginning but it really had no special name
until about 900 A.D., at the time it was first
united into one kingdom. A Viking sea king, who,
became more interested in his own land than in
others', fought and brought all of the Danish area
under his rule and for a time was also king of
Norway. King Harold Bluetooth (app. 935-985),
son of King Gorm and Queen Thyra, began to be
in favor of peace and of staying home and building
up his kingdom; but the war-minded nobles, who
couldn't forget the fun of being Vikings, felt
differently. The King's son, Sweyn Forkbeard,
was their leader and the opposing forces fought.
The king was slain and Sweyn became king
<span id="page-20"></span>
(app. 985-1014). He called the nobles and peasants
together and with his main chieftains, "Torkil the
Tall" and "Oluv the Fat", sailed to England and
harassed her king, "Ethelred the Unready", until
he subdued him and became king of England too.
His triumph was short however, for the very next
year this "Caesar of the North" fell off his horse
and died. (The English contend St. Edmond slew
him) Canute the Great (1018-1035) fought and
added part of Sweden to this fantastic North Sea
Empire, and though he was a good and mighty
monarch he died young. Sad to say, under the
reigns of his incompetent sons, Harold Harefoot
(1035-1040) and Hardicanute (1035-1042), the great
empire toppled and England slipped through the
fingers of future Danish kings. King Sweyn Estridson
(1047-1074) tried to regain his famous Uncle
Canute's vast English holdings and sent Viking
fleets there to defeat William the Conqueror, but
was unsuccessful. From then on the two countries
more or less turned their backs on each other.
Though they sometimes fought, cultural and commercial
bonds were severed and each went their
own way and wrote their own histories for about
the next eight hundred years. As long as the
Viking fleets were free and manned by volunteer
peasant raiders, and as long as there were settle-
ment chieftains to organize them on their own
initiative, the Danish Vikings continued to be a
terrifying threat to their western targets; but
when the Kings took over and forced the issue,
that business of raiding simply petered out. Den-
mark never again reverted back to what she had
been before and Christianity began to take root
there.

Since kings are only people and since people
are different, so were the Danish kings and their
performances, as a brief commentary on some
who ruled during the early Middle Ages tends to
indicate, Canute the Holy (1080-1086) introduced
a tax for the benefit of the Church (10% of all
harvested corn) and imposed heavy fines on the
peasants who rebelled in North Jutland, from
whence he was forced to flee to a cathedral where
they slew him. Because famine followed his
death--and miracles are said to have happened at
<span id="page-21"></span>
his tomb--he became Denmark's Patron Saint.
Oluf Hunger (1086-1095) ruled through nine years
of famine. Eric Egode meaning "the only good
one" (1095-1103) so named because the crops
began to grow again in his reign, wasn't really
good. So he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land
as a penance and became the first European King
to do so, though he died enroute. Since it took so
long to get word back to his subjects, he ruled
Denmark for nearly a year after his death--believe
it or not. King Niels (1104-1134) sat peaceably
upon his throne, steadily attending to the affairs
of State like some ancient Scandinavian nobleman
farmer. But he bored the modern knights and
nobles, who forced him into battle over Slesvig
(South Jutland) in his declining years. Eric
Emune (1134-1137), hard, brutal and generally
loathed, was condemned at a "Thing" meeting and
slain by a Jutlandic noble, "Black Plough". Eric
Lamb (1137-1146) the inadequate, almost let the
kingdom fall apart, since each peasant settlement
began governing itself as it had before the country
was united, In practice, the person of the Danish
king still meant so little that the peasants had
small difficulty having things their way.

"The Great Period of the Valdemars" (1146-1241)
began with the "War of the Princes", wherein
three royal contenders fought bitterly for the throne.
They divided Denmark into three parts, one for
each; but at a banquet to celebrate the peace,
Canute was slain, Valdemar wounded, and Swen
Grathe blamed. He fled but in his flight was killed
by a Jutlandic peasant, who "split his skull with an
axe". King Valdemar the Great (1157-1182), whose
mother was Russian, reunited the Kingdom and be-
came the first of three successful kings to rule
during one of the most progressive and prosperous
times in Danish history. The last of these, Valde-
mar the Victorious (1202-1241) won much territory
for the Crown, especially from Germany. (It was
in his reign that the great battle took place at
which the Dane's flag "Dannebrog" supposedly
floated down from heaven as a "sign from God.")
But just when things were looking wonderful for
the country, the king was taken prisoner and held
for years while the Germans regained Holstein.
<span id="page-22"></span>
When released, Valdemar fought again to win back
the land but was victorious no more--he lost the
battle, one eye and a son in the fray. Shortly
before his death he drew up a set of national laws,
for up to this time Denmark had no uniform or
written ones. Since rules and regulations were not
always remembered alike by the "lawmen" of the
various settlements, there were often problems.
This "Jutlandic Law" proved most successful in
solving these.

King Eric "Ploughpenny" (1241-1250), so
called because he instigated a plough tax, had
trouble with the Church. Eric Clipping (1259-1286)
made peace with the Church but had trouble with
the nobles, They felt the time had come to curb
the king's powers and made him sign an agreement
to that extent. (Royal Charter of 1282) This gave
the nobility much more say in the Danish government
but it didn't bring peace. One terribly
stormy night the King, who was hunting in Jutland,
was forced to take refuge in a village barn. A band
of nobles fought their way in and attacked him,
leaving him dead with 56 wounds. Legal action was
taken, under terms of the new Charter, and nine of
the country's leading nobles were found guilty,
among them the Lord High Constable Stig Andersen
Hvide (most likely one of our grandmother's distant
relatives, and ours). He was banished and retired
to an island in the Kattegat where he lived like an
ancient Viking - raiding the Danish coasts.

Two kings in succession nearly wrecked Denmark.
Eric Menved (1286-1319) and Christopher II
(1320-1326 & 1330-1332) mortgaged most of the
country to pay for their extravagances, until not
one single square foot of land remained in Dane's
possession. Denmark was without a king for nearly
eight years and the king was without a kingdom,
while her wealthy German masters built their
castles all over, levied crippling taxes on her
peasants to pay for them, and sent ruthless German
soldiers to collect the money. By 1340 the country
seemed doomed; rebellion was seething throughout
the land, but especially in Jutland. A powerful
Count, "Gert the Baldheaded" of Holstein, marched
up into the peninsula with an army of 11,000 men,
<span id="page-23"></span>
intent on quelling the trouble at its source. Buton
the night of April 1st a Jutlandic Squire, Niels
Ebbesen, crept in and slew the great Count in his
bed chamber. The news sped swiftly all around
Jutland and her peasants geared for battle. In the
face of it all the invading Germans lost their courage
and retreated south without fighting. Denmark
was saved! Niels Ebbesen became a national hero.
(There is a statue of him in Randers.)

King Valdemar "Atterdag", sometimes called
"the evil" (1340-1375), won little affection in Denmark
but he won back the land, bit by bit, all
except south Slesvig. He was on his way to confiscate
that when he suddenly died "of an unfortunate
remedy for curing gout." (During his kingship the
terrible bubonic plague [Black Death] struck, claiming
almost half the Danish population.) Though he
had no scruples he was one of Denmark's most
noteworthy kings, for what he accomplished was
short of miraculous. At his death his daughter
Margaret (1387-1397) wormed her way in and had
the nobles proclaim her, not as queen but as "Dame
of our Kingdoms, Master of our Houses, Mighty
Guardian". She united the three Scandinavian,
countries under one ruler, to be elected jointly,
and this union lasted, on and off, with Sweden for
126 years, but Denmark and Norway remained
united for 434 years (until 1814). With Margaret,
the familiar intimacy of nicknaming Danish kings
ceased, then heraldic names were used and later
numbers.

Sitting astride the "Sound", Denmark had
controlled this entrance to the Baltic Sea, one of
Europe's busiest channels, since ancient times.
Her king, Eric of Pomerania (1397-1438), antagonized
all the seafaring nations by introducing
"Sound dues", He decreed that all who passed
through there should pay toll, and to make sure
he built huge fortified castles on either side,
For 428 years the ships of all nations were obliged
to dip their flags, strike their topsails, and pay
"dues" when passing Elsinore (where Hamlet's
ghost once walked), This brought immense sums
of money to Denmark but endless political misery
as well. This king is described as having been
<span id="page-24"></span>
very handsome, with "a beautiful physique, golden-yellow
hair, a ruddy complexion and a long, slender
neck which he covered with a linen cloth fastened
with a golden brooch. He would leap into the
saddle without the help of stirrups, and all women
were drawn to him". The peasants finally rebelled
at his autocratic rule and the nobles followed.
Tiring of it all he abdicated, hied himself to an
island and pensioned himself off as a pirate. His
nephew and successor, Christopher of Bavaria
(1439-1448) joined with the nobles against the
peasants, whom they tried to subjugate entirely.
When the peasants rebelled in northern Jutland the
King went in person at the head of an army and
dealt them a bloody defeat.

So the self-willed Barons, Counts and Knights
of Denmark were having their day. It had become
a tradition to award all the highest ecclesiastical
posts in the Danish Catholic Church to the Danish
nobles as political plums. Under these aristocratic
leaders the Church took over a great deal of the
good land and became rich and powerful, Too,
assemblies of nobles and high churchmen (Rigsraads)
had largely taken over control of the government,
under the kings whom they elected.

> --Ancient Danish folk ballad

Time was when Danes thought the only honorable
death was a violent one. Denmark has had a
terrible record of wars:--peasants uprising against
nobles or kings and vice versa; nobles up-in-arms
at the kings or the clergy; the Crown fighting the
nobility or the Church. Then, if Danes were not
scrapping among themselves they were warring
with their neighbors--and no wonder. For the
<span id="page-25"></span>
greater part of a thousand years Denmark had to
maintain a two-front postion involving constant
threats from Sweden on her northeast and Germany
on her southwest, with Russia always looking
through the window. It was as though a pair of
grasping pinchers had been suspended over the
little Kingdom. Time and time again she has
fought Sweden for the supremacy of Scandinavia
and the Baltic, and so often she has been at war
with powerful, dynamic Germany over the provinces
of Holstein and Slesvig (Schleswig in German)
which have been batted back and forth since
the days of the Vikings.

The small Kingdom has been ruled by
"Christians" and "Fredericks", with one King Hans
thrown in, for the past 520 years, Forty-four
years before Columbus came to America the first
King Christian ascended the Danish throne--and
the fighting went on as usual. Christian I (1448-1481)
went to Sweden to settle matters there and
his fleet won at sea, but it is said that as the two
land armies advanced upon one another each leader
prayed to St. George (of dragon fame) for victory.
As the Swedes could pray in Latin and Christian
only knew how in German, the Danes lost. The
Dane's king was more fortunate in the south however,
for he united Slesvig and Holstein under his
rule. He established the first Danish University
also. King Hans went to war and united Sweden
with Denmark and Norway again, but had to give
all their nobles much greater power. He built the
Danes' first proper navy (ships especially for war)
and established their first naval base.

Christian II (1513-1523), a dynamic, violent
king with a big, red beard, loved beauty and culture,
and he loved the Danish peasants too, He enacted
measures which benefited them and curbed the
powers of the nobles. This caused a terrible
breach between them. He occasionally fell back
on an ancient legal practice and called in twelve
peasants from a village and had them pass judge-
ment on a wayward noble, according to ancient
Nordic custom, which they usually did with these
words: "Not we but his deeds do judge him".
Christian II went into exile but was captured and
<span id="page-26"></span>
held prisoner in his own land for 36 years, at the
command of his two successors, both of whom he
outlived. The peasants fought to free him and make
him king again, which brought on "The Counts War",
a great internal struggle involving tremendous
bitterness and bloodshed.

Frederick I (1523-1533) had to win the crown
by force and maintain his position in the same way,
for the peasants wanted the old king back, When
Christian III (1535-1559) was throned, the peasants
in north Jutland really rebelled; they marched
against a well-armed force of Knights sent to quell
them and inflicted a crushing defeat--then marched
south, setting castles and manor-houses ablaze.
Then the new King sent his army after them under
his cruel Holstein general, Rantzau. The peasants
retreated north and made a stand at Aalborg but
Rantzau's troops took the town by storm, plundered
it thoroughly, slaughtered its inhabitants plus 2,000
other peasants who stood their ground there. Soon
entire north Jutland was subdued and its peasants
either executed or deprived of their "freeman"
privileges. These forces then turned to Copenhagen,
whose citizens were for the old king, and laid siege
there. For more than a year her people held out--famine
struck and they ate every cat and rat and
even chewed the grass growing on the ramparts,
while their dead piled up everywhere and they were
forced to surrender. Christian III did away with
the Catholic Church and installed Lutheranism in
its stead. He made the convents and monasteries
fiefs of the Crown and confiscated all Church property,
which was considerable. From then on
there has been no separation between Church and
State in Denmark.

The lack of education of Frederick II (1559-1588)
was appalling but his times were scholarly.
(Denmark then had one of the finest scientific
institutions of the day.) He fought a "Seven Year
War" with Sweden, with no gain. Nor could he
conquer his own appetites--he loved wine and
drinking cut short his life. His son, Christian IV
(1588-1648) became Denmark's most renowned
king, the one the Danes know best and for whom
the national song, "King Christian", was written.
<span id="page-27"></span>
He was a worker and a builder and founded towns
and made improvements from one end of his realm
to the other. He was jovial and his court was gay;
loved music and fostered organ building; spoke
several languages, founded colonies in India and
elsewhere--and in fact he simply popped his nose
into everything! But he made a mistake when he
tried to aid certain German factions in their own
thirty-year religious struggle--and Denmark's
Jutland paid the price. She was terribly ravaged
by Germans, who destroyed her towns and pillaged
her manors. Then the Swedes followed the Germans
in and ransacked Jutland all over again.
Christian IV became battle weary, disappointed
and impoverished. His second wife divorced him,
his friends deserted him, his many children took
sides against him, and he had trouble with his
sons-in-law. Lonely, bitter and practically forgotten
he died, after having ruled Denmark longer
than any other king (60 years), during which time
Queen Elizabeth, James I and Charles I sat on the
throne of England, in turn; the Puritans and Pilgrims
sailed in droves to New England for
religious freedom and the Atlantic Ocean replaced
the Baltic and Mediterranean seas as monarch of
the trading routes.

Germany and Sweden continued on the warpath
during the rule of Frederick III (1648-1670)
and each marched again into Jutland--there wasn't
much left of her! The whole of south Jutland was
paralyzed and very nearly depopulated, and it
looked as if the Danes' land was at last to be
divided up between her two perennial enemies.
Denmark saved her neck, fortunately, but was
forced to sign the most expensive peace treaty
of her life, giving Sweden a third of all her property--in
fact, all of her territory east of the
Sound, which included the valuable Scanian
provinces. This was the most serious territorial
loss she ever sustained. Then the Swedish king
decided he might as well have all of Denmark
while he was about it, so he sailed back and fell
on Copenhagen unexpectedly. He laid seige to the
city and, despite the fact that practically the whole
of the rest of Denmark was in Swedish hands, her
citizens decided to fight. Everybody got into the
<span id="page-28"></span>
act: the King pitched his tent on the ramparts in
defiance; a friendiy Holland fleet fought its way
through to help; women, children, students and
citizens worked side by side and civilians and
troops trained for battle. It was six months
before the city was stormed (10 Feb. 1659) but
the Danes were ready! While the men fought,
women and children loaded muskets, dragged
wooden beams and huge stones to be heaved down
on the heads of the enemy and heated lye and water
to boiling, to pour down if they tried to clamber up.
Hour after hour and attack after attack the Danes
fought tenaciously until the Swedes finally had
enough. At least 3,000 of the invaders died but
only 20 Danes. Copenhagen was free, Denmark
was saved--but the prevailing mood was one of
deepest gloom because of the destitute, crippled
and reduced condition of the nation. The nobles
were blamed for it all but were too enfeebled to
rise up against anybody. So the King considered
this an excellent time to have his full say and,
after astute negotiations, proclaimed himself
"Absolute Monarch" of Denmark and Norway. It
was very unusual but there was no bloody revolution at all.

About this time the nobles were required to
take definite surnames to be retained by succeeding
generations of their posterity, in lieu of the patronymic
pattern of surnaming then in common use in
Denmark; ex. --the addition of the suffix "sen" to
the given name of one's father, if a male, and
"datter" if a female. This new order of naming
was designed to more fully identify the nobilities
and their descendants from the commoners. Kings
had been similarly set apart by nicknames,
heraldic titles or numbers since the beginning.
Peasants were not required by law to discard the
patronymic form until 1828 in most cities and 1856
in general.

Christian V (1670-1699) built up the Kingdom
and gave it a Statute Book of new laws by which he
ruled honestly and well. One of the bloodiest
battles ever fought in all of Scandinavia took place
during his administration, when he and his army
crossed over into Scania to try and win her back
<span id="page-29"></span>
from the Swedes. The main battle started off the
dark winter morning of 4th Dec. 1676 with the
cavalry forces of both armies rushing against
each other. It lasted all day, and that evening,
as rain drizzled down and darkness fell, almost
9,000 Danish and Swedish corpses lay stretched
out in the muddy fields. It was a war of senseless
havoc and destruction and the Scanian provinces
were completely devastated. (These people were
of the Danes own.) The Danes won at sea as usual
but lost on land, and Sweden retained Scania.
(Would the Danes then never learn?) Legend has
it that from that day on Christian V had the windows
of Kronborg Castle in Elsinor, which faced Scania,
blocked up; he was unable to bear looking out
across the water toward the green coast of the
Danes' lost land.

When the American colonies wrote their
Declaration of Independence and started the
American Revolution, Christian VII (1766-1808)
had been on the Danish throne for ten years, but
he was quite incapable of ruling, Less than
seventeen when he took the crown, he was slight
of build and it soon became apparent that he was
slightly mad too. (It is said that his chamberlain
was no doubt largely to blame--he believed in
using a firm hand and had cowed the young Prince
by beating him.) His personal physician moved
himself up in the government, post by post, until
he gained absolute power and held the King in the
hollow of his hand, as it were. But the doctor was
finally condemned to death by popular demand. At
this time the Dano-Norwegian fleet was strong and
trading excellent. Slesvig and Holstein were under
Danish control, but relations with England were at
low ebb and war with Russia was threatening.
Denmark's industry was awakening and the famous
Royal Copenhagen Porcelain factory was founded.
Intellectual life unfolded; art, painting, drama,
poetry, all came to the fore, Danes re-discovered
the beauty of their ancient Nordic past and wrote of
gods and goddesses and of love of their country.
A spirit of nationalism grew and blossomed. One
of the popular songs of the day was written by a
Holstein bard:- "Let me rejoice that Danish blood
within my veins doth flow"--and Danes everywhere
<span id="page-30"></span>
took up the refrain.

But the Danish peasants then, unfortunately,
had little to sing about. They had been largely
deprived of their ancient freedoms, Most of their
"Thing" meeting privileges had been taken away
and they could no longer own land. Though they
continued to live closely side by side in small vill-
ages and cooperated in cultivating the community-owned
property as in ancient times, they were
forced to rent their individual farming land from
the nobility or the Crown. For the use of these
lands they paid "manorial dues", a good part of
which had to be worked off on the estates of the
owners. The power these aristocratic bosses and
their overseers wielded over the peasants was considerable.
These often had to leave their own
plantings and harvests to work endless hours taking
care of those of their masters. Little these cared
if the peasants' crops failed from forced neglect
and they were thus unable to pay the balance of
their "dues"--they could work those off too (or
take a beating in the bargain). Many were compelled
to forfeit their fields and were reduced to
little more than slaves. Others made out quite
well and obtained a "copyhold" on the farms they
rented, so that their sons could take them over
from them at their deaths (though a land owner
might transfer a son from a good farm to one that
was neglected). Then, from the time of Christian
VI (1730-1746), pleasants had been "bound to the
soil". This meant that all men in the rural areas
were bound to remain living on the same estates
or in the same villages or districts for the entire
period in which they were liable for military service,
at which time they were forced to fight in the
King's armies. Though peasants moved very little
anyway, they felt that they were really being pushed
around!

Frederick VI (1808-1839), who governed for
his ill father as Crown Prince before he became
King, served the Danish people for a total of fifty-five years.
He set about early to improve agricultural
conditions and to give the peasants of his land
a new lease on life. He decreed that they could
now own their own land, consolidate their various
<span id="page-31"></span>
fields, and decide for themselves how hard they
toiled. If they continued to work for the nobles,
from necessity or choice, their hours of labor
were limited by law to give each peasant some
time for his own fields or affairs. This was a
great reform, and in gratitude for it a monument,
"Liberty Obelisk", was erected to the "liberation
of the peasants" and stands today in the center of
Copenhagen. It wasn't long until the old communal
villages were abolished and the more progressive
peasant-Danes moved onto their own farms or into
neighboring small towns.

Since the middle of the 18th century the most
common flag seen on the Seven Seas, after the
British, was that of the Dano-Norwegian merchant
navy. The latter part of that century England had
lost the American Revolution and was now involved
with the French. She began casting her eyes on
Denmark and Norway (after generations of ignoring
them) in hopes of embroiling them in this fight
as allies. But the twin countries managed to keep
themselves free of entanglements for a time and
enjoyed a period of tremendous prosperity in
shipping and trade. England demanded that their
ships cease calling at French ports, and in order
to enforce this, started seizing Dano-Norwegian
merchant vessels. The Scandinavians joined with
Russia in an armed neutrality pact, their motto
was, "Free ships, free cargo!" The situation
became critical. Early in 1801 England sent a
fleet into Danish waters under Admirals Parker
and Nelson. It was a most strategic time since
Denmark's allies' ships (Russia's) were ice-bound
and her own fleet was in winter quarters, dismantled
and crews demobilized. After bombing Elsinore:
the English sailed straight for Copenhagen with 35
ships, 1,192 guns, 14 cannons and 8,885 experienced
men against a hurriedly gathered Danish force of
630 guns and: 5,234 men, mostly volunteers. After
five hours of violent lopsided fighting (though the
Danes fought bravely) the Danish forces were
defeated, over half being wounded and hundreds.
killed. But the Danes spirits were not defeated--their
spunk was up, and they continued their trade
and tried to steer clear of the flames of war. The
French Revolution ended with the founding of
<span id="page-32"></span>
Napoleon's Empire and his starting to do just about
as he pleased with all of Europe. Then Denmark
and Norway, with the second largest fleet in the
world, decided to join with England, in spite of
her earlier attacks on the Danes; since to go
against this world's greatest maritime power
would be catastrophic for them.

Denmark enjoyed six more peaceful years,
with trade as usual, but apparently forgot to convince
England that she was on her side, because
on the last of August 1807 Crown Prince Frederick
was visited by an English envoy who demanded that
Denmark enter into an alliance with his country and
hand her over the entire Dano-Norwegian navy in
pawn for the duration of the "present situation."
Now Frederick was down on Jutland's Neck with
most of his army, preparing for battle with
Napoleon's forces who were marching towards
the Danish border. He couldn't believe the English
were serious (after all, they were now friends!)
He said he would "think it over", then hurried to
Copenhagen to see what was going on, and arrived
just as a huge English fleet with 30,000 men, was
casting anchor in the Sound. He made meager preparations
for an attack there, still doubting it would
come, and rushed back to Jutland to await Napoleon.
The English delivered a final notice and then, as
the Danes were silent, prepared to bomb Copenhagen
from all sides. Indignant, to say the least,
its citizens got ready for battle, as they had 150
years ago with the Swedish. There were some
100,000 inhabitants crowded behind the old ram-
parts of the city but only 12,000 men able to fight.
For three days the bombs reigned down upon them--they
hadn't a chance and had to give in. This time
the fleet was to be war booty, not a pawn. Two
days after, flames were still crackling in the
houses and smoke still pouring through the streets,
while approximately 2,000 corpses still laid
unburied and more than 1,000 people lay wounded,
wherever space could be found. The English
seized the royal dockyard and all the storehouses
and occupied the harbor. All ships were made
ready for sea; those they could not take were
hacked to pieces. Every single thing was stuffed
on board, even to the last chart and telescope;
<span id="page-33"></span>
whereafter the entire Dano-Norwegian fleet then
stationed there, was hauled out of the harbor for
the last time. There went the pride and joy of two
kingdoms gliding out to sea. "The beaches were
black with people watching in deadly silence as
their beloved vessels slid slowly past--and Danish
naval officers wept." The whole affair seemed so
absurd. There was no proof whatsoever of any
hostile intentions on Denmark's part or of the
necessity of attacking Copenhagen at all. (We
can't take anything away from the English though,
for they were gentlemen all the way--they left
commissioners behind to pay for their board and
room and gallantly left a pleasure frigate that had
been presented as a gift to the Crown Prince by
his uncle, the King of England.) There were com-
plaints in many quarters outside Denmark, including
some of the members of England's own House
of Lords.

Denmark was sucked into the European
whirlpool, there could be no doubt now where she
must stand. She joined with Napoleon and, though
for seven years England controlled her territorial
waters, waged a gunboat war against her. Norway
was the hardest hit, as her coasts were blockaded
till famine came, and in the midst of it Sweden took
her over. This terminated the 439 year union between
the twin kingdoms, Norway and Denmark.
Denmark's days of prosperity were over. The
war with England had completely destroyed her
maritime trade. Her tiny distant colonies were
cut off and her national economy was bankrupt.
She had nothing left outside her poor, beaten.
country except Greenland, the world's largest
island (mostly a cake of ice), the Virgin Islands
(which she later sold), the Faroe Islands in the
northern Atlantic, and Iceland. (Incidentally,
Iceland and Denmark had been united under the
same kings for 564 years, when Iceland took
advantage and dissolved this union abruptly, as
Denmark struggled for her very existence under
the occupation of the Germans during Herr Hitler's
rampage of 1939-1944. This Icelandic treatment
was a last straw; it was like kicking a pal when he
is down.)
<span id="page-34"></span>
Things looked pretty black, but Frederick VI
still sat on his throne with his dearly beloved family
about him; "he was father to his people and their
contact with the past, which seemed to be collapsing
so unmercifully". But the country still existed--Denmark
had survived another catastrophe. She
had often been involved in the political strife of
Europe, often ravaged by foreign troops or written
off as an independent State by her neighbors; but
she had never been completely conquered or sub-
jected to foreign dominion--somehow she had
always managed to pull through. Oh yes, she had
had her days and her moments, but the country was
too small to stay "great". Slowly trade started
again and shipbuilding, poetry-making and painting.
(Danes then mostly painted ships--great men-o'-war
with billowing white sails ploughing through
the water, in and out among the bright green
islands.)

When the old King died in 1839 he was generally
mourned. With him a whole era passed to
the grave--a Denmark that would never return. It
was an era of reverses and deep disappointments,
and perhaps mistakes, "but after all it was asking
quite a lot to be able to steer a Ship of State
unscathed through the typhoon that Napoleon loosed
over Europe." Danish peasants carried the King's
coffin along the last part of the road from Copenhagen
to the cathedral in Roskilde, where Denmark's
royal heads are buried. He had truly been
their friend.

Christian VIII (1839-1848), the old king's
cousin, was bitter and disappointed; for though
Danish ships were sailing again, things were not
the same. It was much too obvious that Denmark's
position among nations had sunk so low that she
hardly counted anymore. There was sarcastic
criticism of the old autocratic form of government
in many Danish circles, and when King Christian
VIII died, after nine years of rule, the crisis came
to a head. His son, Frederick VII (1848-1863),
was neither loved nor admired. There was unrest
all over Europe. Shots were ringing out in the
streets of Berlin and Paris. "In Denmark feelings
mounted to such extraordinary heights that a number
<span id="page-35"></span>
of honest citizens donned their top hats and frock
coats and went to see the King and told him they
wanted a free constitution. They got it!" (Revolutions
in Denmark always took place in a special
Dane's-way.) A constitutional assembly began
drawing up a new constitution, and then an uprising
broke out in Holstein and Denmark went to war
again to save Jutland's neck, this time against
Holstein rebels. After three summers of fighting,
in which Prussia joined against the Danes, the
matter was straightened out and Slesvig and Holstein
remained in Danish hands. In the meantime
the new constitution was signed (5 June 1849) and
Denmark's Absolute Monarchy was overthrown
after 190 years. She was now to be governed by
an assembly consisting of two chambers, "Folketing"
or Lower House and "Landsting" or Upper House.
The King's rights were laid down constitutionally
and all Danish men, aged 30 and above, were
granted the right to vote--"one man, one vote".
Without the Danes ancient and inspired love of
freedom and their tradition of self-governing
settlements as a background, their new "Democracy"
might have failed, but as it was, the neverending
cry for "Liberty" was heard and, answered
again!

The London Protocol dated 2 Aug. 1850, and
signed by Denmark and all other important European powers, pledged to uphold the integrity and:
unity of Denmark's new Constitutional Monarchy.
A later treaty set and approved the royal succession
of Danish rulers and supposedly settled, once and
for all, the thorny question of Slesvig and Holstein
by giving them to Denmark with an international
blessing. Still a later treaty (1857) did away with
Denmark's "sound dues", for which she was
promised the equivalent of some 2,000,000 pounds.
In turn, Denmark agreed to continue to police the
"Sound" and set up additional lighthouses all
around her ragged coasts. Danish waters were
feared by seafaring folk, especially off west
Jutland where, year after year, ships went
aground and were reduced to matchwood by the
merciless waves of the cruel North Sea. The
new government got off to a good start and Denmark
began to find her way again.

<span id="page-36"></span>
Since Frederick VII had no sons the Danish
crown passed, as per treaty, to Christian IX of
the House of Glucksburg (1863-1906). Both he and
his queen belonged to the old Danish Royal House.
It has remained with him and his direct descendants
for the past 104 years, or to the present. The old
headache of Slesvig and Holstein came up again and
war with Prussia and Austria resulted--they came
and took away the two provinces, so Denmark was
reduced again. Frederick VIII served for only six
years (1906-1912), but his son, Christian X, ruled
35 years (1912-1947) and had the two great World
Wars to worry him. World War I was not so bad,
as Denmark tried to stay aloof, but 100 of her ships
were hit by German submarines, with no consideration
at all. Two good things came of it however:
Danish women got the right to vote and the League
of Nations gave Slesvig the right to vote too on
where she wished to be, and only north Slesvig
Subjects chose Denmark, and so Jutland's neck was
finally divided up and thus it remained.

The small-land-Danes have actually only lost
28 miles of their original territory to big, husky
Germany over the centuries they have been fighting
for it. But they nearly lost all of Denmark in World
War II, when Hitler's Germans moved in on them.
Had it not been for the efforts of their "Freedom
Council", who engaged in a saboteur's war, aided,
and directed in the end, by radio from England,
they could have. Denmark fought from within and
the whole thing was a nightmare! A noble effort
was made in behalf of the Danish Jews, 8,000
strong. The Gestapo had their eyes on them and,
after nearly four years of occupying their country,
decided on the "High Holy Days" to tend to their
extermination. But it never happened, for the
Danish risked everything they had to save their
fellow Danes, the Jews. In brilliant feats of courage
on all sides, those of the underground helped
the Israelites to escape to Sweden and safety; few
were lost. There have been no race riots in
Denmark--only wars.

When it was announced that Hitler was dead,
and the Danes realized the war was nearly over, it
was feared that the final battle would be fought in
<span id="page-37"></span>
Jutland and Denmark braced herself for the attack
as, hour after hour, the fighting front came closer,
The final phase of World War II was enacted,
literally, on the Danish border. When word
finally got around that the Nazis had capitulated,
Danish resistance groups began settling accounts
and taking care of a few matters, and the Germans
and the Danish traitors couldn't get out of the
country fast enough! In Denmark there was the
biggest festival of all:--cheering, laughing, dancing
in the streets, and Danish flags flapping all over.
She was saved again.

In the thousand years in which history has
accounted for the royal heads of Denmark, there
have been over a half hundred ruling there--good
kings, bad kings, a dead one and a mad one, and
one uncrowned queen. By far the majority of
these have been sober-minded, sensible people.
It seems that there has always existed in Denmark
an ancient, unfailing ability to choose, more or
less, the right leaders. Frederick IX is ruling
there now and has been for the past 22 years
(1947- ). Greenland has been made a Country
instead of a Colony, one house of the Danish
Parliament has been abolished, "Landsting", and
women lately have at last been given equal rights
to become Danish rulers, just as men. Since
Frederick IX has no sons, his daughter Margrethe
is heir apparent and will likely become Denmark's
first crowned queen. The feeling still persists
that in Denmark, in spite of the blackest days,
things can never go really wrong; for she has
always pulled through in the past. But--her
position at the gates of the Baltic is still vulnerable,
as always, and one cannot help but think
that Russia (the Great Bear) has her eyes on her
and is mightily interested in seeing how she handles
herself and that gateway. Then, during the last
few decades, Denmark's government has leaned
heavily toward Socialism. One cannot help
wondering if freedom once again is gasping for
breath in that lovely land of the green islands.
War is not always the way.

## OTHER DIMENSIONS
<span id="page-38"></span>

Far back in the history of Denmark, its
people must have felt that there was something
greater, stronger and more glorious than themselves--something
they ought to fear, reverence
or worship. Surely this feeling, this belief, this
upward urge was a part of the makeup of our first
Danes, as it was with other prehistoric peoples,
and as it is with us. Of course there would have
been the doubting Thomases, the self-sufficient--or
shall we call them skeptics--who live by the
rule of the known dimensions and never take stock
in anything they cannot see, hear, smell, touch,
taste, or perhaps heft. These there will always
be: the individuals, through whose well-walled
thinking "the intangibles" never filter nor do they
leave any mark upon the conduct of their lives.

Palle Lauring, in his book "A History of the
Kingdom of Denmark" (from which so much of the
information about this country was taken) has this
to say about the Danes first--shall we call it
religion? 

> Among prehistoric Danes, apparently
whether anything went right or wrong, was a question
of fate. The powers-that-be decided one's
luck and thus one had to pacify them, protect
oneself against them and, if possible, be on good
terms with them. There was hardly a question yet
of real gods. Spirits lived in streams and marshes,
and offerings to them were made everywhere. The
woodland lakes were black and dangerous, so
earthenware vessels containing food and amber
pearls were lowered into the bogs and marsh ponds;
magnificent great stone axes were consigned to the
streams; meat was deposited on sacred stones; and
in spring and autumn, the all-important periods
when all matters were decided, it is likely that
sacrificial-feasts were arranged.

> ...At the same time there was some
thinking being done about the dead. They should
be allowed to take what was theirs along with them
when they were buried, for in the next life they
might need their things. Nobody wanted the dead
to come back in order to claim their property--the
dead were dangerous. So weapons and jewelry,
<span id="page-39"></span>
etc., were buried with corpses. . . When the
farmer replaced the hunter there was a new type
of thinking, or what we might call a 'new religion'.
To plough the earth was to cause it pain, to clear
the forest was to offend it; therefore, sacrifices
had to be made to trees and stones and you had to
be friends with the sun. (Nothing was known of
the chemistry of the soil or of the sprouting of
seeds or plant diseases.) Whenever anything
went right or wrong, it was fate!

Nordic mythology was the only religion of
the Scandinavians for ten centuries. This form
of believing followed the "fate" period among these norsemen.
When the Danes and their colleagues
began to feel a little better acquainted with the
vast unknown, the spirits, whom they feared or
worshiped, took the forms of legendary people,
gods and goddesses and demigods galore, to whom
they paid their respects. Some of the days of the
week were named after various of these; for
Wednesday was for Wodin or Odin, who
ruled in the heavens, the great all-father god of
these early Danes. They thought he lived in a
palace made of gold and silver, called Valhalla.
Two ravens stood on his shoulders and he sent
them to fly around the earth to give him news of
all they saw and heard. Round him stood maidens
with helmets, spears and shields, called Valkyries,
who were sent down to earth to bring the souls of
heros slain in battle to feast forever with Odin in
his great hall Valhalla. When the thunder rolled
and the lightning flashed, in the course of a wild
storm, Danes would say, eyeing the sky, "There
goes the mighty Odin and his warriors riding into
battle in their great carts, lashing their steeds."
Thursday got its name from Thor, the strongest
of Nordic gods, who had a great hammer which no
man could lift, a pair of powerful gloves and a belt
which, when fastened round him, doubled his
strength. Sometimes when the thunder roared it
was not Odin riding, but "Thor banging his huge
hammer". Friday was named for Frigga, wife of
Odin and goddess of marriage, supreme among all
the Danes' goddesses. The rainbow in the sky was
the bridge by which the gods rode to their home,
Asgard.

<span id="page-40"></span>
Early Christian monks were said to have
visited Denmark, but with no success. During the
course of the Viking raids on England, the Danes
were often "exposed" to the influence of Christianity
but it was more or less like "casting pearls before
swine". It is said some Vikings even permitted
themselves to be "marked with the sign of the
cross", prior to baptism, when they were in foreign
climes but that when they came back home they
"washed off the baptism" and once more paid their
respects to Odin and Thor. "It was not because
their souls were false but simply because they
regarded Christ as God in western Europe and
therefore it was as well to be on good terms with
him while in his countries. But at home in Scandinavia,
Thor and Odin were still gods and naturally
one couldn't fail them."

Denmark's king, Harold Bluetooth, personally
became converted to the Christian faith and tore
down his father's old pagan altar at Jelling and
built a church. He tried to convert his people to
Christianity but it was impossible to convert a
whole nation of tradition-bound pagans all at once
and he had little success. Canute the Great became
a devout Christian. His greatest triumph, outside
of the establishing of his fantastic North Sea
Empire, was when, on Easter Sunday 1027, "he
strolled up the aisle of St. Peters in Rome beside
Conrad (who was that day crowned Emperor), as
his guest of honor and witness".

But the Danes were still heathens, worshiping
their pagan gods, for almost a thousand years after
the first solid Christian churches were established
by the early monks in western Europe. It wasn't
until King Sweyn Estridson took a hand that the
Danes began to be Christians to any great extent.
Under him the Danish Catholic bishoprics became
firmly established, the churches became extraordinarily
numerous and the area divided up into
ecclesiastical parishes. Stone church buildings
appeared everywhere (the first ones had been of
wood). These were mostly austere, stern and
simple, like the old Anglo-Saxon ones in England;
but in Funen and Jutland they were ornamented
with a ponderous type of primitive sculpture, among
<span id="page-41"></span>
the most impressive created in Europe at that
time.

One of the most prominent Middle-Age
Christians in Denmark was Archbishop Absalom,
who served during the Great Period of the Valdemars.
He wrote the Danish chronicals from which
have been gleaned so much of Denmark's early
history and folklore. Then, the Danish Christian
church was ruled under the direction of the Pope
at Rome. Of the more than 1,700 parish churches
existing in Denmark today, roughly 1,500 date
from the Valdemar period or before. Big cathedrals
grew more numerous then also; but, though
there were churches a plenty, they were not able
to eradicate the Danes ancient thinking about many
things. Their verses still contained tales of mermaids
and water sprites and stories of the dead
returning to haunt the living; maidens flying to
their loves in suits of feathers (transformed into
birds); men having raven-spells and flying by
night; and fairies dancing in the meadows and
dwelling in ancient grave mounds and, if they
invited a young swain to come to them and he
resisted and fled, they took most fearful revenge!

> There is dancing in the churchyard<br>
Dancing girls with flowing hair.

Trouble between Church and State had been
going on in much of Europe for ages but it really
didn't begin in Denmark till around 1250 and from
then on, for the next two-and-a-half centuries,
there was trouble between Danish rulers and the
bishops. Good terms between these two forces
were re-established about 1500, when it became
the custom to award most of the high posts in the
church to Danish noblemen who supported the
Crown. The Danish Catholic Church then became
very rich, especially in real estate, and its chief
activity took on more the nature of grandiose
estate management than religious service. All
churches, both large and small, were lavishly
decorated with expensive murals in glowing colors,
art and woodcarvings, mostly imported, golden
altar pieces of beaten gilded copper. The monasteries
were prospering too. But among the peasants,
ancient pagan beliefs refused to disappear and
<span id="page-42"></span>
relics of their old heathen cults were still to be
observed for, after all, "Rome was far away".
On "Wakeful Nights" the young men and girls of
the villages went to the churches, taking their beer
casks with them, and danced and made merry.
Night life in the churches was not exactly Christian,
"but to avoid offending the images of the pious
saints on such occasions, their pictures were
turned with their faces to the wall". Thus, though
there was no longer a gap between Church and
State in Denmark, there was a big one between the
Church and its congregations. An extensive feeling
of unrest in religious matters was felt as the
Danish Catholic Church's hold upon the population
slackened.

So there was not much to stop the new
religious doctrines of the reformer, Martin Luther,
which were then being formulated in Germany,
from seeping into Denmark and the existing church
there was unable to strangle them. Fanaticism
and mass excitement in religious movements were
uncommon in the Dane's history, for there was
usually cool sobriety among them where religion
was concerned. Then, too, at this time the Danes
had the "Counts War" to think about--war was
another thing! When the bloodshed was finally
over, the death knell of the Catholic Church in
Denmark was sounded. King Christian III proclaimed
Lutheranism as the religion in his land
and all who opposed him were forced to give in.
Though all Catholic bishops were imprisoned in
one swoop, they were released on condition that
they get out of the country or join the Lutheran
Church. Most of them stayed and changed over.
Acts of violence were few and the struggle was
nearly over. Now all these new Lutheran clergy
were required to do was to perform their religious
duties and keep their noses out of other matters--no
more land grabbing or politics! Thus the
Reformation was carried out rather simply in
Denmark.

When absolute monarchy was introduced in
1660 the Danish churches became the property of
the State and Lutheranism became the national
religion of the kingdom. All Danish subjects
<span id="page-43"></span>
were required to belong to this State Church and
baptism was compulsory. This law was rigidly
in effect for the next 189 years. On 5 June 1849
an assembly of great significance to the people of
Denmark was held in Copenhagen, for it was then
that their new constitution was signed. Among
this document's stipulations was one regarding
religious tolerance. The Danes had taken a great
step toward freedom once again! It had taken a
long, long time to prepare the land of Denmark
and her people for the coming of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ to her shores.

* * * * *

Four months later another assembly of
great importance to the Danes was being held
thousands of miles to the west. It was harvest
time in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, but in
that two-year-old community on the American
frontier the main interest of its inhabitants was
not in the fields of golden grain but in the October
Conference then in session in the completely filled
Bowery. Here on this late autumn day, 7 October
1849, the emphasis turned to missionary work. A
passage from the Bible (Rev. 14:6) was read:--
"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them
that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people." This prophesy,
believed to be the destiny of the new church whose
members were gathered there, could be fulfilled
only if more foreign missionaries were sent out.
The Latter-Day Saint church had opened the
British Mission in 1837 and the South Pacific
Island Mission in 1843, but this had been only a
start. It was felt that now was the time to expand
the program. Members in attendance held their
breaths, so to speak, as name after name was
read out as having been selected to go on a foreign
mission--to France, Italy, Great Britain, the
Society Islands--and Elders John E. Forsgren
to Sweden and Erastus Snow and Peter O. Hansen
to Denmark.

Since winter was about to close in and wagon
trails east would be treacherous, if not impassable,
the group were given but twelve days to prepare
<span id="page-44"></span>
themselves and their families for the long separation.
The company was organized for traveling and
on 19 Oct. 1849 left the Salt Lake Valley, number-
ing 35 men, 12 wagons, 1 carriage, and 42 horses
and mules, This was the first company of missionaries
sent from the Rocky Mountains, The journey
proved long, tiring, and at times even dangerous.
On Monday Nov. 12th the group was attacked by
about two hundred Cheyenne warriors, on the
Platte River, but escaped unhurt. On Friday,
Dec, 7th, after two months, during which time an
over-ruling Providence was clearly made manifest
in their behalf, the missionaries arrived at Ft.
Kearney on the Missouri River. It took another
five months before Elder Peter O. Hansen arrived
in Copenhagen (11 May 1850) the first L. D. S.
missionary to ever set foot on Danish soil. A
native of Denmark, he hoped to convert his own
people and some of his friends, but they would
have none of it. On 14 June he was joined by
Elders George P. Dykes, John E. Forsgren and
Erastus Snow, the latter to serve as president of
the infant mission, with Elder Hansen as interpreter.
The four humble missionaries immediately
shut themselves up in the upper room of a hotel in
Copenhagen, where they offered a prayer of thanksgiving
for their safe arrival and dedicated themselves
to the service of the Lord; while ribald carousers
held forth in a bar directly below far into the night.
At that time Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland
and Finland were placed under the "Scandinavian
Mission" with headquarters in Denmark's capitol
city, and remained so until divided in 1905 and the
"Copenhagen Branch" was Organized, with headquarters
in Copenhagen.

So the gospel seed was sown in Denmark, for
better or for worse, and on 12 August 1850 the
harvest of souls began. On this date the first
Danish L.D.S. baptisms in this dispensation took
place when 15 candidates, mostly Baptists,
entered the clear waters of Oresund, immediately
outside Copenhagen, and received this important
ordinance. In writing to the First Pre sidency,
August 17th, Elder Snow Said, "The Lord has
visited the believers with many visions and dreams
and manifestations of the Holy Spirit. They have
<span id="page-45"></span>
drawn out of us, by their faith, everything pertaining
to the gathering, the redemption of the
dead, etc., and drink it in as an ox drinketh up
water. . ." Later he told how some of the early
investigators there had seen the Elders in vision
and knew them on arrival. And again, reporting
to the authorities in Zion he wrote, "As far as
my experience and observation extends, the Danes
are a kind, hospitable people, especially the middle
classes, and higher tone or morality pervades here
than exists in corresponding classes in England and
America; and if I mistake not my feelings, the
Lord has many people among them." On the 25th
Nov., a second Danish branch of the Restored
Church was organized, the "Aalborg Branch" in
northern Jutland, with headquarters in the city of
Aalborg. (This has been in continued existence
ever since and is still one of the largest and best
branches of the LDS Church in the Scandinavian
countries.) By the close of the year 1850 there
were about 135 members of the new church in
Denmark and things seemed to be going pretty
well for them and their church there.

But opposing forces were stirring and preparing for battle.
It seemed certain that the same
unhallowed persecutions which followed the preaching
of the gospel in ancient days would become an
integral part of the experience of these nineteenth
century disciples, even here among the liberty-loving
Danes. The Clergy of Denmark's State
Church brought all the anti-Mormon falsehoods
that they could find from America and England
and after inventing a few of their own, inveigled
the Danish press to join in the campaign against
these so-called "Mormons". Even the Bishop of
Zealand, ranking Bishop of the Lutheran Church
in Denmark, issued a pamphlet which catalogued
the usual filth against them. Here is a quotation
from an article which appeared at the time on the
front page of "The Tidende", one of the most
popular and respected Danish newspapers in
Copenhagen, claimed to be reprinted from a paper
in Paris which had printed it straight from a paper
in London:--

> It is reported on good authority that
missionaries from a church which calls itself by
the grandiose title of the "Church of Jesus Christ
<span id="page-46"></span>
of Latter-Day Saints" (known as Mormons from
the title of a so-called new Bible they call the
Book of Mormon) is now sending representatives
to proselytize in Denmark. For the past dozen
years these Mormons, who style themselves also
Saints, have been preaching with good success
among the lower classes of England. We feel it
our duty to issue warnings to our brothers in the
north countries, having discovered for ourselves
the nefarious purposes to which these men have
put their religious teachings. They are recruiting
whatever members of the European working and
peasant classes they can find, who are ignorant
enough to listen and be influenced, taking them to
American West where they are treated as indentured.
servants.

> . . . Some thirty-five thousand converts in
thirteen years have been made in England, of which
more than five thousand have emigrated already to
a barren wilderness they have the affrontery to call
'Zion', as if the wandering children of God were
being taken home according to the prophecies in the
Old Testament. . . We need hardly to point out that
this is a most lucrative business for the so-called
Authorities in America. They have now begun to
charter whole ships, which sail out of Liverpool,
their agents profiting from ship and railroad
rebates, as well as excess baggage charges,
while they fleece the poor and ignorant emigrants
at every step. But this is only the beginning of
the profit, of course, for the priesthood on the
other side of the Atlantic, and we are appalled to
consider the possibilities, once these poor people
are forced to labor as they are told or die in the
wilderness. Assistance is given them to leave
their homes, but none to return.

> This is an appalling story, a church that
dares to give itself a Christian name, proposing
to take the poor of the earth into an earthly heaven
and then, for unquestionable obedience, to eternal
rewards. Instead, the faces of the emigrants are
ground into the earth, 'tithes of time and toil' are
exacted from them, and their labor is exploited,
while they struggle to repay their debt to the agents
who persuaded them to the enterprise.
<span id="page-47"></span>

> There are well-founded rumors here that
not only are the poor exploited in Utah--called the
'Promised Land' by these erstwhile missionaries
even now preaching on our streets--but that young
women are especially susceptible to their ideas
(as young women will forever be when men are
good looking and unscrupulous, with money in
their pockets) and are later forced, by poverty
and desperation, when they are once in America,
into illegal marriages with the so-called 'Apostles'
of the Mormon Church.

Blasts against the infant church continued
coming from press and pulpit. The Elders in
Denmark decided not to answer these charges
openly but to go on quietly holding their meetings,
improving themselves in the language, and aiding
Elder Hansen in the Danish translation of the Book
of Mormon (whose sheets finally came off the press
22 May 1951). They did not advertise their meetings
but they continued to be filled at the appointed
hours, not only with faithful members and sincere
seekers of the truth, but with ruffians and others
who were there for no good purpose at all. The
opposing clergy labored with students of church-sponsored
schools to join apprentices and the
rough-necks who attended the Mormon services,
to break up the meetings, and this they often did;
but that isn't all they broke up, as the following
quotes from "History of the Scandinavian Mission",
by Andrew Jenson, indicate:--

> While visiting with
a few Saints in Vendsyssel, Elder Dykes, who had
been having great success in the Aalborg Conference,
was met by a mob, who beat him and
threatened his life. The ruffians broke all the
windows in the house in which he was visiting and
the tile came crashing from the roof as the house
was generally demolished. But with the aid of
some friendly women he escaped through the back
way and returned to Aalborg. Attacks of this kind
were not unusual against all the brethren but these
men were not easily discouraged and they found
many of the honest in heart for whom they were
seeking, in spite of all the angry rumblings.

Sunday, 22 June 1851

> Elder Hans Peter
Jensen and his missionary brethren announced a
<span id="page-48"></span>
public baptismal service to take place in the open
waters of the Limfjord, near Aalborg. A great
number of people gathered to witness the event.
Before proceeding with the ceremony, Elders
Jensen and Christian J. Larsen spoke to the
assembled multitude, advising them to flee from
"the Church of the Devil", intimating that the
Lutheran Clergy represented that church. Bedlam
broke loose and the Elders were dragged by
the mob before a prominent clergyman of the city.
The mob went to the Saints meeting house, broke
all the windows and tore the doors down. Soldiers
were ordered out that night to restore a semblance
of order, but before their arrival a severe thunderstorm
broke, the likes of which had seldom been
seen in Aalborg, and the mob scattered. . . For
six nights more the depredations were repeated,
with the mob intent on almost any crime; but a
check on all missionaries and members later
disclosed that, while there were bruises and tales
of narrow escapes by the missionaries who had
been at their wits end, all had escaped serious
personal harm.

Nov. 1851

> A mob, fanned to white heat by
their own fanaticism, burned the home of Jacob
Bohn, chanting 'Let's baptise the Mormon Priest
in his own blood' soon after it was discovered that
he had joined the LDS church as the first convert
in Randers. But Brother Bohn came back after
the fire and praised God that his journal, containing
about fifty hymns he had written, had not been
destroyed.

On Sunday, 14th Dec. 1851, four of the
brethren held a meeting at Brondbjoster, a
suburb of Copenhagen, and many of the Saints had
come out from the Capitol City to attend the services.

> . . . As soon as the meeting was dismissed
and the visitors began to disperse and
start on their return trip to Copenhagen, they
were greeted with a shower of stones, potatoes
and other missiles, from a crowd which lay in
ambush waiting for them. After proceeding a
little farther, someone gave a signal that the
Saints were coming, and when they came within
the firing line they received another salvo of
<span id="page-49"></span>
potatoes and stones. Still farther on, men and
women, who had posted themselves along the
hedges and in trenches, came out to take an
active part in the unequal battle between the
Saints and sinners. Some of the assailants were
armed with heavy sticks and clubs, and stones and
dirt flew thick and fast. Some of the women carried
missiles in their aprons with which to supply
their male companions, while they, in a blasphemous
manner, cried out, 'Now call on your
God to defend you!' Some of the brethren were
knocked down and rolled in the muddy road and
beaten with sticks and fists; their coats were
torn to pieces in several instances and even one
of the Sisters was abused and handled very roughly.
For more than half a mile the mob pursued the
Saints in this manner, and when they at last came
to a farm house by the roadside and sought shelter
within, they were not safe there either and fled
across the fields in the darkness, still pursued by
their "Christian" friends, until they reached
another farmhouse where they also sought shelter.
But its occupants refused; however, a friendly-
disposed girl kindly showed them a way out through
the garden into the fields, and they finally escaped
from their pursuers.

One of the sufferers said
of this occasion,

> For three quarters of an hour
we were seemingly in the hands of the devil, but
while God permitted him to have power over our
flesh, our spirits rejoiced, for we knew we
suffered for the cause of truth. One cannot describe
the suffering we passed through, but for a
short time it certainly looked as if none of us
would escape with our lives.

The missionaries
and Saints in Denmark never fought back to save
their lives, but were advised to follow the admonitions
of the Savior, who said, --"When they persecute you in one City, flee to another".

As the membership of the new church grew,
so did the persecutions--everywhere in Denmark.
The Elders appealed to the Mayors of the cities
and to the police, but received little satisfaction.
The ruling authorities, though claiming to be in
favor of religious freedom as a principle, could
not agree as far as the Mormons were concerned;
and though the new Danish Constitution guaranteed.
<span id="page-50"></span>
the right of freedom of religion, it was not backed
up by the collateral laws nor by the moral force of
the country. Since street meetings were prohibited
by law, and public meetings curtailed or broken up,
the Saints had to hold their gatherings in private
and often in secret. (It was worse in Norway and
Sweden where there were no laws at all aimed at
religious liberty.) Sometimes the meetings were
held in people's barns. Numerous ones were
started when ordinary citizens were asleep, and
not until the call of the nightingale heralded the
coming of dawn did the meetings close. If mission-
aries were accused of infractions, such as holding
meetings when forbidden, preaching the gospel,
baptising or what have you, they were taken before
the various authorities and fined for the crimes of
practicing their beliefs. If they didn't or couldn't
pay the fines they were jailed in lieu of these, and
fed on bread and water; then they were just as apt
to hold meetings in the jails as not. After being
released they would immediately start preaching
again and continue until re-arrested on the same
charges. Sometimes mob action became so violent,
seemingly with police consent, that meetings had
to be discontinued entirely for periods of months;
but the Saints went steadily on, praying in their
own homes; the missionaries went quietly on associating
with and preaching to the members in their
homes; and the mobs, made up mostly of men and
boys, continued to meet in greater numbers for a
time, but had to be content to spend their fury on
themselves and the rented meetinghouses.

In some parts of the countryside in the
mission, citizens joined in a conspiracy not to sell
anything to Mormons or to hire anyone who was
known to have been baptised. Children of Mormons
were mocked and mistreated in school and
the Lutheran Clergy advertised the names of new
Mormon converts so that they could be shunned
and hated by their fellowmen. Anti-Mormon pamphlets,
filled with misrepresentations and falsehoods,
were continually being published and caused
considerable opposition to the work of the Lord in
Denmark. There was much hostility toward the
Saints in most places. But despite the seemingly
untiring efforts of all opposing forces combined,
<span id="page-51"></span>
the LDS church continued to grow and prosper in
Denmark.

At the General Conference of the new church,
held in Copenhagen in April 1853, it was announced
that membership in the Scandinavian Mission then
numbered 1,331, of which 1,133 were Danish, 88
Norwegian and 110 Swedish. Baptisms of members
were well over a thousand for each of the years
1856, 1857, 1858. At the close of the year 1859
the Mission contained 3,934 baptised members of
the Restored Church, 2,512 in Denmark. These
were over and above the over 2,000 who had emi-
grated to Zion, the 460 who had "lost the faith"
and been excommunicated, and a number who had
passed on. Even members of the national governing
bodies themselves began to be alarmed because
of the progress of the new church in their midst,
and well they might have been. "The local brethren
were as apt to hear of the Restored Gospel one day,
be baptised on the next, and on the third be called,
as likely as not, as 'traveling Elders', every man
to warn his neighbor."

Why were conversions so easily made in the
Scandinavian Mission? Who can deny that part of
the seed of Israel had been scattered in that land
of the Norsemen and that the sheep knew the voice
of the shepherd? The homeland of these people
had been the homeland, as we know, of the early
Vikings. It was a more or less common occurrence
for the people to find here old battle shields, large
stones or other objects with ancient runic writings
on them, in the fields or on the sea coasts, These
"finds" were often sent to educational institutions
where men of higher learning translated them and
published the findings. Was it not then simple
enough and logical also for many Scandinavian
people to believe the stories that the missionaries
told of golden and brass plates found in a hillside
in distant America? And when found by a young,
Prophet, was it not perfectly natural that he
should translate the writings found thereon and
have them published? And so they believed!

## EMIGRATION CAN BE A MAGIC WORD
<span id="page-52"></span>

> The courage and devotion of the Saints who had their roots in Denmark, and others of the Scandinavian countries, and whose lives were modified by the gospel, have been seldom equaled. The posterity of the thousands of these Latter-day Saints, who left their homes in that bright land for the sake of the gospel, should remember them with fervent gratitude and thanksgiving!

> (So wrote Doyle L. Green in 1950, managing editor of the Improvement Era.)

"Gathering to Zion" was not stressed among the Scandinavian members of the restored Church until 1852; but when it was, it was found that the Danish people were ready and eager. The incessant persecutions, in nearly all parts of the mission, increased their desire to emigrate. Accounts of the growth of the Church, in the tops of the beautiful mountains far away to the west, were often relayed to the Northland, urging the brothers and sisters there to "come to Zion and help build up the kingdom!" The scriptures were searched and it was pointed out that those who answered this call would surely be assisting in the fulfillment of prophecy; for was it not written in the Holy Bible about such things? They read from Micah 4:1-2: "But in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."

The Saints of the mission were counseled by the elders to do all in their power to practice thrift and save to emigrate to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Though some 17 Danish Saints had emigrated independently in 1850, the first organized emigration from the Scandinavian Mission, under Church direction, took place 11 March 1852, when 28 members, mostly Danes, <span id="page-53"></span>sailed from Liverpool, England, in the ship "Italy," [Andrew, the ship should be in italics but I can't just italicize one word] bound for America and "Zion." (Ole Ulrick Christian M&oslash;nster, a former Baptist and one of the very first LDS converts in Denmark, was in charge of this group.) In 1855 quite a group of Saints from Iceland were among those emigrating to Utah. They settled in Spanish Fork among a thriving group of Danish Saints there. By the end of 1857 upwards of 2,000 Scandinavians, mostly Danish, had left the mission, bound for Zion's headquarters in America. That fall, all foreign missionaries of the Church were called home because of the coming of Johnston's Army to Utah, which threatened war. This supposed "Utah War" never took place, however, but Mormon conversions in Denmark were lowered because of a shortage of missionaries, and emigration for the year was reduced to 70.

In Utah, a Church immigration fund had been set up to help the incoming Saints and from which they could borrow for their passage to Zion. Church wagon trains were often sent to the Missouri and Mississippi River junctions to meet companies of the poorer Saints and bring them on west across the plains. At the close of 1860 part of the tithing collected in the foreign missions, heretofore used for the expenses of the missionaries, branches, and conferences in those areas, was made available for the emigration of the poor, of whom there were many. From then on the Danish missionaries, as well as those in other foreign missions, had to sustain themselves, while funds for the maintenance of branches and conferences were raised by the free-will offerings of the local Saints. Thus were these members tried and tested; but it seemed that the added sacrifices and efforts brought manifold blessings in their wake. A great spirit of brotherhood grew in that northern mission. It was as if a magic wand had been waved over the heads of all its members, with the accompanying command of "Let there be charity among you!" It is heart-warming to learn of the love and sacrifices of these people for each other and the gallant generosity of the more prosperous in behalf of the less fortunate of their associates. <span id="page-54"></span>For example, "Brent Nielsen was so free in outfitting his brethren and preparing their passage that he was warned by the missionaries that some might accept the money and then apostatize. To Jacob Bohn, the hymn writer, he said: 'You need never repay me because you labor for God's kingdom"; "Jens Andersen of Veddern, Aalborg County, assisted no fewer than sixty of his fellow converts to emigrate; but, like Moses of old, he was never permitted to set foot in the promised land, as he died en route on the North Sea in 1862, soon after leaving his native Denmark"; "Andrew Eliason, a well-to-do Swedish land owner, sold his estate and paid the passage for a hundred of his brothers and sisters in the gospel to start out for Zion." In 1862, in New York, it was discovered that many of the poorer Saints lacked funds to continue west. The financially able Scandinavian immigrants immediately donated money to assist their less-fortunate friends west to Florence, Nebraska, where they were met by Church trains with supplies and means to take them on to Zion. "A Danish brother, Lars Petersen, about 30 years of age, who had assisted about twenty poor Saints to emigrate, was accidentally drowned in the 'Weeping Water,' a stream near Wyoming, Nebraska, where he, together with others, went to bathe. He was buried June 28th with much expression of sorrow by the sympathizing Saints." These compassionate desires of the more wealthy of the brethren to help those in need often made it possible for friends and neighbors to go to Zion together.

The price of emigration seemed high and far above the reach of many of those who desired to go. It was announced that for each adult the cost was 150 Rigsdaler ($75) provided one walked across the plains; but if one wished to share a wagon with seven other adults it would cost 200 Rigsdaler ($100) each. Those expecting to emigrate under the above terms were to send their money, names, ages, occupations, dates of birth, etc., to their respective conference presidents, advancing at the same time 40 Rigsdaler for each handcart emigrant or 80 Rigsdaler for each one planning to go by wagon. This money was forwarded to America <span id="page-55"></span> for the purchase of equipment for the journey across the plains, such as handcarts, wagons, oxen, and provisions. In 1865, due to the inflation brought on by the Civil War in America, the price of everything was higher there. A wagon that year, at the outfitting places, was about $200 in greenbacks or $100 in gold, and a team of oxen sold for about $150 on the average.

An amusing story is told of a group of Danish immigrants of 1853 on the American Plains near Keokuk, Iowa, where they had received their oxen and wagons for the journey westward: "Some of the Danishmen, disliking the American way of driving oxen in yokes, hitched up their beasts of burden in regular Danish fashion. But they had forgotten one thing--the oxen were American. The poor beasts were half frightened to death and started out in a wild run. A council meeting was called in which it was decided that it would be easier for the immigrants to learn American ways than it would for the oxen to work with Danish harnesses. Too many of the oxen had never been hitched up before and this, coupled with many inexperienced drivers, soon ended up to many upset wagons in gullies and ditches.

Indeed, all was not roses! Though anti-Mormon opposition died down in Denmark for a few years; in 1860-61 it again rode high in some parts of that country, especially in northern Jutland, where it became impossible once again for the Saints to hold public meetings. Fuel was added to the flame of hostility when it became known that a group of Scandinavian emigrants had apostatized in 1862 near Omaha, Nebraska, on their way to Zion. They sent many false reports back home, several of which were printed in Danish newspapers with relish. Some of the sectarian priests reprinted the letters in tract form, with their own embellishments, causing feelings against the Mormons to rage. Elders and Saints alike were mistreated because of these malicious reports. The renewed rantings against the restored Church, however, only accelerated the Church's success: baptisms increased in the mission and so did emigration. Who wanted to remain in Denmark and be treated <span id="page-56"></span>like dirt under feet, not only by ruffians but by neighbors, former friends, and sometimes even one's very own flesh and blood as well? And this, merely because one desired to worship as he chose. So, emigrate one must, if only to assuage one's pride, but mostly to find peace and security for oneself and family among people of good will. Even though the mortality rate of some of the companies crossing to Zion was high, particularly when the dreaded disease of cholera attacked, that was a chance they had to take. "Zion" was for the persecuted, and the promise of it beckoned like a great light to the Scandinavian Saints and thousands of them decided to follow its gleam.

By 1860, there were 4,416 members in the Danish mission: 1,107 were new that year, with 240 members emigrating to Zion. In 1861, baptisms rose to 1,954 and around 1,000 emigrated; in 1862, 1,977 souls were baptized and no fewer than 1,556 left, in four different companies, for the "Valley of the Mountains." During 1863, new converts totaled 1,587, but emigration was limited to 1,458. The branches and conferences of the LDS church in Denmark and her sister kingdoms were being impoverished by the emigration of these stalwart members, while the little kingdom of Denmark was being drained of some of her finest blood.

In the beginning of 1864, war--which had been threatening for some time between Denmark on one side and Prussia and Austria on the other--broke out and on February lst the armies of those two powerful German states crossed the Danish border into Jutland and the war was on over the age-old controversy about Slesvig and Holstein. It was an unhappy experience for the Saints in Jutland and elsewhere in Denmark too. Among the Danish brethren subject to military duty were a number of young LDS missionaries who were immediately forced to take up arms in the fight; a few, however, were able to hurriedly emigrate before they were drafted. Thus many of the best native elders were torn from their fields of labor and the work of the few others who remained was suspended in some measure, In the Island of Fyen (Funen) the American missionaries had a hard time because <span id="page-57"></span>Danish troops stationed there took them prisoners, tried them as spies, and imprisoned them for a time. The retreating Danish forces fleeing through Jutland in May 1864 and the victorious Prussians who followed them caused havoc and all kinds of trouble for the few missionaries who remained there. They overran the whole Jutlandic peninsula, some even going north as far as Skagen (Jutland's nose). In Aalborg, the German troops took possession of the Saints' meeting hall, thus preventing the holding of meetings in the area. The increase in Church membership in Denmark, understandably, was not as great that year, nor was emigration; but in Sweden and Norway, both proceeded about as usual. However, the determination to "go up to Zion" was just as great, for emigration was a goal becoming more and more desirable to the Scandinavian members. In reporting on the mission at the close of that year, President Carl Widerburg wrote: "The spirit of gathering is great among the Saints, and those who can are preparing to emigrate next season. Would [that] we had means enough to emigrate the poor, honest and faithful souls who are struggling here in poverty, hardly able to support themselves, work being scarce and wages low."

* * * * *

There was war going on in the United States of America then too. It was a bloody Civil War in which her President, Abraham Lincoln, sought to preserve the Union as well as set the black slaves of the country free. While Denmark's war then only lasted about six months, America's lasted well over three years and was still going on in the early part of 1865. Since things there were so unsettled, prices so high, and things in general in more or less confusion, the Church authorities in Utah decided not to send wagon trains east that year; so only those who could afford to outfit themselves for the plains crossing were advised to emigrate. One company of Saints, numbering 557, left Copenhagen on May 4th of that year, however, bound for Zion; and with the exception of one single day's storm, the weather was mostly fair and favorable during its entire voyage. But this was <span id="page-58"></span> not always the condition of things on board, for beside the Scandinavian Saints, a number of other emigrants crossed the Atlantic on that trip. Elder Christoffer J. Kempe wrote of this:--"While peace and good will reigned among the Saints, the others, who were Lutherans, Baptists and Methodists, lived more like cats and dogs together; some had disputes and engaged in fights, others played cards and swore, while some preached; altogether there was real pandemonium." Three adults died on the way, and twenty-five children succumbed from measles and scarlet fever. One day, a fire started on board and created quite a panic before it was doused. Meeting a ship coming from America, the west-going emigrants were informed that the Civil War there was over and the Union had won. All were ordered on deck, where they gave many rousing cheers for the Red, White, and Blue! It took this company of emigrants 190 days to complete their journey to Zion; namely, 42 days from Copenhagen to New York; 12 days from New York to Wyoming, Nebraska; 36 days preparing for the journey across the plains (since no Church wagons awaited them); and 100 days travel from Wyoming to Salt Lake City. The journey across the plains was not without danger as the Indians were on the warpath and the "Black Hawk War" was raging in the state of Deseret (Utah). At Fort Laramie, this company, in 45 ox-drawn wagons, was halted and warned by U.S. officers there not to go any farther west because of the hostility of the Indians. Free passage was offered to them to any other part of the United States to which they wished to. A meeting of the Saints was called where the brethren decided to reject this offer and take their chances on reaching Zion; so they went on. Elder Peter A, Nielsen, one of these 1865 emigrants, gave this account of what followed: "About three days out from Laramie (at a place called Wood Hollow, where we camped [at] noon), while the men were driving the teams to a watering place about three quarters of a mile from camp, about a dozen and a half well[-]armed Indians sprang from their ambush in the woods and tried to drive off our oxen. We opened fire and this frightened the oxen and they ran back to camp, but seven of the brethren were badly <span id="page-59"></span> wounded. John Swenson had two arrows in his left arm and Peter 'Doctor' had one in his cheek and one clear through his neck. A Swedish brother came into camp with an arrow in the small of his back and was not able to walk again on the journey. All we could do to relieve the sufferers was to let them sit down on a wagon hub with their backs against the spokes while we, using as surgical instruments common blacksmith's pincers or nippers, extracted the arrows from all except Peter 'Doctor.' The arrow in his neck could not be moved until we found a pair of extra-long-handled pincers. Then, laying the man upon the ground with his head resting upon an ox-yoke, two men sat upon him while another, with one strong jerk, pulled the arrow out. Brother Holmgreen was shot by a bullet and taken up for dead, but [he] recovered. A man by the name of Andersen was shot by a bullet, which took off a bit of his cheek and a chunk of his nose. Brother Frederick Gruntvig came into camp with an arrow fastened into his right hip; his wife had been carried off by the Indians and no more has been seen of her."

Snow overtook these weary people before they reached their destination the fore part of November. Had they not been helped in at last by relief mule-teams and provisions, they might never have made it. Emigrating, even at its best, was no easy matter; but the Scandinavian emigration kept up.

1866 was the last year that the emigrants traveled all the way across the plains by handcarts or covered wagons, as the transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad reached Omaha, Nebraska, by 1867. Also in 1867 some of the Saints crossed the Atlantic by steamship, but the cost proved so high that sailing ships were again pressed into service for awhile. On 10 May 1869 the railroad reached Utah and the days of sailing-ship and ox-team travel were ended for LDS emigrants. The journey then, by steamship and railroad, could be made from Denmark to New York in 13 days and on west to Utah in another 14. From Copenhagen to Utah in 27 days was quite a feat, considering that it sometimes took all of six months the old <span id="page-60"></span>way. The Saints jogged along in fine style on those early railroad trains at between 12 to 15 miles per hour. Omaha to San Francisco was $40 by train, "emigrant class." These emigrant cars were usually attached to freight trains. Yes, emigration was like magic when one traveled in a modern all-the-way-to-Zion-in-comfort company! 

By the end of that century some 30,000 Scandinavian Saints had migrated to the Rocky Mountains, and they continued to "cross over." They were hardy people of high character and dependability with splendid reserve power. By far the majority of these were from the little kingdom of Denmark. It is a somewhat startling fact that just one hundred years after the flame of the gospel was first kindled along the shores of the North Sea. Forty-five percent of the total membership of the Latter-day Saint church was made up of Scandinavians and their descendants. These plucky, sturdy people have been adding their strength to this church now for the last one hundred and eighteen years; strength of numbers yes, but strength of character and works as well. No other strain or race has contributed more to the upbuilding of the great western section of the United States than the Danish and their fellow northlanders. 

God has led a chosen people out of many "Babylons'' by the mouths of his prophets. Exodus in the Bible, one of our earliest accounts of a religious migration, tells how the children of Israel wandered with Moses for 40 years in the wilderness before they reached their "Promised Land." The Book of Mormon gives a history of the migration of another favored people who sailed with Father Lehi across the great Pacific to distant shores, seen by him in vision. The Puritans and Pilgrims of the 1620s traveled in ships like the Mayflower to the rock-bound coasts of New England to escape religious persecutions; and the Mormon pioneers of 1847, vanguards of thousands who followed, crossed the great American plains in search of a place where they too might worship in freedom. The massive emigration of Scandinavian Saints who traveled equally long distances, both by land and sea, to join the pioneers in Zion, is just as great a movement as any of these. When <span id="page-61"></span> the departing Danes took a long, last look at the "Lovely Land" and sailed away, they were leaving behind the country that had cradled their kinfolk for a thousand years and the forces which had woven each everlasting fibre into the tapestry of their very beings. They crossed more than an ocean and a continent when they said goodby to Jutland and her world of green islands; they crossed latitudes of blood and longitudes of the mind. Things would never be the same for them again as they turned their faces west and set sail toward their "Promised Land."


## KJALLERUP . . . 1847-1852

The mind does strange things in the quiet of
the night. It is as if I were not here in Utah's Zion,
writing, this February 1969 but in the small village
of Kjallerup in northwestern Jutland, Denmark, one
hundred and twenty-two years ago. . . . Autumn
. . . . Summer. . . . Spring. . . . the seasons
and the years roll back and the breath of another
winter comes over the North Sea licking its hoarfrost
and spreading snow over the land like an
ermine blanket to shroud the death of summer.
It is the forepart of February 1847, Days are
shortened and folks lean forward over the work
in their hands. Lanterns are hung in the barns
for both milkings and women run errands with
their shawls clutched over their heads. The wind
howls and the bitterness of ice is in the air. The
mail coach comes but seldom now, but when it
comes it comes with a great stir, horn a-blowing
and bells a-jangling through the snowy dusk, as
hoofs of horses clatter on the frozen ground.

In the warm thatched cottage of Anders, son
of Christen, things are in a hustle. Bedstemoder
Karen is trying to hush and settle the little ones,
wee Karen and Mads, while her son Anders is
hurrying to pull on his great boots as his wife

<span id="page-62a"></span>

<br><br>
Jutland

<span id="page-63"></span>
Mette, from her couch, face wreathed in pain,
urges him to be gone. It's a harsh night to be out
in but he must hitch the wagon and fetch the midwife.
Donning his sheepskin coat he chides eight
year old Christen - "Now mind the log fire for
your Mor", and as Mette cries out again, adds
quickly: "Ja, Ja - I go now". Pulling his fur cap
low he turns to the door, bracing himself for the
weather outside. He hopes this baby will be another
boy - a man can use sons on a farm.

Anders himself had been born in this small
farming village of Kjallerup forty years ago come
April, and had lived on this very farm as long as
he could remember. His father, Christen Christensen, 
had come from the town of Vestervig south
and his mother, Karen Andersdatter, from the
village of Jannerup north, some years before his
birth and settled here midway between the two
places and raised their family. Five children had
blessed their union in Kjallerup. Anders' older
sister, Inger Cathrine, now Fru Peder Larsen of
Hvidbjerg, and his two younger brothers, Niels
and Niels Christian, were still about, but he could
hardly remember his baby sister, Ane Kirstine,
who had died at less than two months of age some
thirty-seven years ago. Anders' mind went back
as he rode through the February cold towards the
midwife's cottage, When his father had become
old and unable to look after the farm, he himself
being the oldest son had taken over and looked
after things and his parents as well, When the
aged man passed on when nearing 78 years, 13
Feb. 1838, he had continued to live there on the
farm and care for it and his mother. The two of
them had lived there alone until she kept at him
to find himself a wife, which was no easy matter
for a hard to please "ungkarl" (bachelor) like
himself. But then he had found the comely Mette,
whose parents lived in the small farming village
of Svindborg, Orum Parish, southwest a few miles
from Kjallerup.

Anders thought of their marriage, 5 Dec.
1843, which took place at Hvidbjerg Vesten Aa
Kirke (Parish Church at Hvidbjerg West of the River)
Thisted Amt, Denmark, not far from their home
<span id="page-64"></span>
in Kjallerup, The Priest who performed the ceremony 
also recorded it in the Parish Church records, 
putting Anders down as "Brudgommen - Ungkarl 
og gaardmand, 36 aar gammel" (Bridegroom
bachelor, farmer, 36 years of age) and putting
Mette down as "Bruden - Pige, 32 aar gammel" 
Bride - unwed female, 32 years of age). Anders also 
remembered that when Mette had come to live with him
and his seventy year old mother Karen, she had brought 
her young son Christen with her.  The child was then 
nearly four years old, having been born to Mette out 
of wedlock, 14 Mar. 1839, and Lyngholm Mark, Hvidbjerg 
Parish.

Mette herself had been born 3 Apr. 1811 in the village 
of Svindborg, Orum Parish, Denmark, the daughter of 
gaardmand Christen Hviid og fru af Svindborg"
(farmer Christen Hviid and wife of Svindborg). 
Little was known, apparently, of her mother, 
Else Andersdatter, except that she had given her 
husband seven children, three sons and four daughters,
Mette herself being the youngest of these, On the
other hand much more was know of her father, 
Christen Jensen Hviid (Hviid meaning White in
English), he having descended way back from a
Danish nobleman family - of which he never forgot 
to be proud.  Some people are like that and carry 
the importance of their forebearers to the point
that they set themselves above speaking to common 
folk and hold themselves aloof, though they themselves 
are practically nothing.  Not that Mette and her parents 
and kinfolk weren't fine people - on the contrary; yet
Mette, like her father, was perhaps overly proud of her
heritage and was often "lifted high" by the nobility in 
her blood. At times she seemed to feel it more than 
others, thought Anders, and then she'd put on airs - but
after all!

Anders had learned to live with this although he 
himself took little stock in such things.  His own 
progenitors had been simple country Danes, Jutlandic
peasants living there in Thy at least as far back as the 
time when Christian IV took over the Danish about the end 
of the sixteenth century.  There was a record of his direct 
line at least that far back but his kin were certain 
<span id="page-65"></span>
ancestors had even been there on the peninsula
at the time of the Vikings and before, fighting
away to keep their lands and freedoms on this
fringe of northwestern Jutland. Anders had no
complaint with life. Hadn't Mette given him a
daughter right away and then a son of his own?
Two fine children in three years and now a third
was on its way. This thought brought him back to
the present with a start. How his mind had skipped
around and busied itself as he had jogged along, his
breath frosty on the air, forgetting the cold in the
warmth of his memories.

He hurries the horses. There is no time for
thinking his own thoughts once the chatty midwife
has bundled herself into the wagon beside him, or
back at the cottage either where Mette lies crying
out in pain. Had it not been so biting cold Anders
would have stayed outside with the livestock and
left the women to it. As it is, however, he
brings in more logs and feeds the fire since young
Christen, despite his chiding, has let it grow low
and gone off to sleep. That boy is poor to heed!
Anders replenishes the kettle and gets the water
to boiling, for use of the midwife, and then turns
his hands to odds and ends of other small tasks
while he waits patiently for a glimpse of his
second own son. But it was not a son but a
healthy baby daughter that Mette presents to
Anders on that 9th day of February 1847 in their
thatched cottage in Kjallerup, Thisted, 
Denmark. . . .

The scene in Kjallerup fades and I am back
at my writing here in Provo, Utah this February
of 1969, thankful for the warmth of my gas heated
home with its electric lights and hot and cold
running water as well as the other other comforts
afforded me in this day and age. Rather regretfully 
my mind comes back to now for there is
work to do here. Before me on the table are
many written details pertaining to the lives of our
Danish progenitors - notes, journals, old letters,
maps - jottings from the memories of their children
and grandchildren assembled and sorted long after
the events they describe are one with the years.  I 
pick up some of these and read them
<span id="page-66"></span>
over - yes, these I must include in this history,
but where and how? Yet I cannot keep my thoughts
from returning to the area of Jutland, Denmark and
the Danish peasants who lived and loved and walked
the earth there so many years ago. And I know I
must go back there, as imagination dictates, and
follow this newly born baby girl and her associates
throughout the remainder of her life and tell her
story as I see it; for she is my Danish grandmother
and very precious to me indeed!

That they should name this second daughter
of theirs for Mette's mother, Else, was natural
since their first girl had been named for Anders'
mother, Karen, who lived there with them. Anders
may have thought that she should have the name of
his only living sister, Inger Cathrine, also, since
Danes often gave their children a whole string of
names. Mette probably objected to Inger but consented 
to add the Cathrine - so Else Cathrine was
the name agreed upon. The Lutheran or State
Church to which they belonged prescribed that a
first sprinkling could be done in the home as soon
after a birth as possible lest the child "die
uncleansed and be damned forever". This home
baptism could be done by any male if the Priest
were not on hand, such as the landlord, gardner,
etc., or even by the father himself. Then as soon
thereafter as could be arranged, weather permitting, 
the family needs must travel to the Parish
church to register the birth and "Hjemmend&oslash;bt"
(home baptism) of the infant, show it off as evidence
to the congregation, have the whole affair officially
recorded by the Priest and likely pay him a goodly
fee in the bargain for his trouble in taking care of
the "Fremstillingen i Kirken" (official recognition
in the church).

Baby Else's home baptism was taken care of
the very day after her birth but it was not until 14
Mar. 1847 that the members of her family, attired
in their best, drove with her in the wagon a 
mile-and-a-bit down the country road to the Parish
church in the neighboring village of Hvidbjerg and
had her naming and sprinkling duly acclaimed and
recorded by the Lutheran Priest there. A copy of
her "F&oslash;dsels og daabattest" (birth and baptism
<span id="page-67"></span>
certificate) reads as follows: "Andersen, Else
Cathrine; Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg sogn, Hassing
herred, Thisted Amt; 1847- 9 februar; 
Hjemmed&oslash;bt 1847- 10 februar; fremstillet i
Hvidbjerg kirken 1847- 14 marts; Gaardmand Anders
Christjan Christensen og hustru Mette Kirstine
Christensdatter." The English interpretation
gives us the following information: Else Cathrine
Andersen, born 9 Feb. 1847 in Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg
Parish, Hassing District, Thisted county (Denmark),
baptized at home 10 Feb. 1847; official recognition
and recording of birth and baptism at the Hvidbjerg
Parish church 14 Mar. 1847; Parents - Farmer
Anders Christian Christensen and wife, Mette 
Kirstine Christensdatter.

Who was there to know at this recording that
a hundred and twenty-two years hence, thousands
of miles away, one of the descendants of this same
Else Cathrine Andersen would be eagerly searching
a copy of this self-same record for the very information 
which was written down there by the Priest of
that small parish church in Denmark on 14 Mar.
1847? Indeed, who was there to know or even
dream then of things to come, much less of the
significant destiny of that little child? The Great
Maker of destinies must have marked it well,
however, and then turned attention to goings-on
in other parts of the world.

* * * * *

It was bitter weather also on the western
American frontier that February 1847. In the
territory of Nebraska at a place known as Winter
Quarters, which was situated on the west bank of
the Missouri River opposite Kanesville, Iowa,
were gathered some 3,500 peculiar people calling
themselves "Latter-day Saints", popularly referred
to as "Mormons". Poorly sheltered from the
weather in hurridly built log or sod houses, they
were the vanguards of some 20,000 "Saints" who
had been much persecuted and driven from their
comfortable homes. In the bleak cold of the previous 
winter, these Mormons had crossed the icebound 
Mississippi in a body and traveled northwesterly 
across Iowa in a continuous procession,
carrying along with them, in mournful wagon trains,
<span id="page-68"></span>
their sick and dying, wounded, lame and blind, and
tarrying in various small settlements along the way.
At the top of every hill they stopped and looked back
towards their once proud city of Nauvoo with its
beautiful temple. The "Saints" had been so driven
from many fair cities and cozy homes:--from Ohio - to
Missouri - to Illinois - to lowa in few more than
a dozen years. Cruel mobs who had threatened and
driven them from their last abodes were now the
owners of their beautiful city and the smiling
countryside around. These were the mobs who had
stopped their ploughs, silenced their hammers,
their axes, who had put out their fires, eaten their
food for which they now hungered, spoiled their
orchards, and trampled underfoot their thousands
of acres of unharvested grain; these were now the
keepers of their comfortable homes and the
carousers in their holy temple, whose drunken
riots insulted the ears and polluted the very air
there. The last company of the driven Saints, the
old, unable and destitute, or the remnants of the
people, who it was hoped could stay on there
unmolested until wagons returned to take them,
turned, when on the opposite shore, and beheld a
sight sorrowful to their eyes indeed; they saw all
the struggles, sweat, toil, dreams and sacrifices
of the past six years go up in flames; for lastly,
the mobsters burned their glorious Nauvoo temple.
So here in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, the vanguard 
of these once-again homeless people were
camped that winter of 1847; there were many
widows and sick among them and burials were
frequent. All were poor in earthly goods, but the
poorer were helped by the better off. Come Spring
they intended to move on west across the great
American plains in search of a new home. Though
they had lost their great Prophet, their city, their
temple and their homes, and were shivering and
hungry in temporary shelters in Indian territory,
it seemed they could not be defeated in their 
purposes; for they still had their God, and through
their trust in him they rose above every discouragement.

At the same time, Christian VIII was King
in Denmark; it was the last full year of his reign.
The country was making brave effort to get on its
<span id="page-69"></span>
feet again after having lost its ponderous navy.
The peasants were making agricultural progress
but behind the atmosphere of modest demands and
thriftiness there was a sort of paralyzing bitterness. 
The Danish people, it appeared, could not
fully get over the grave shocks and losses their
country had suffered, despite the white sails that
could once more be seen tacking in and out between
the five hundred green islands. Even so, as often
during periods of discouragement and reflection,
new ideas, evaluations, and intellectual movements
were dawning there too. It was during this time
that Denmark's great writer of fairy tales, Hans
Christian Andersen, wandered around the streets
of his homeland and wrote the stories that were to
gain him world renown, It was then and there that
Soren Kierkegaard, the theological philosopher,
and Grundtvig, the spiritual revivalist, both
strolled and thought, and here that Adam Oehlenschl&auml;ger, 
Denmark's national poet, both lived and
wrote. Yes, writers wrote and people read, but
no matter how idyllic everything appeared, in the
old Danes' hearts was still the memory of how
things had been before. Sarcastic criticism of the
old autocratic system of government, which it was
felt was responsible for the catastrophe, could be
heard in many circles, and even some youths in
the Capitol enthusiastically demonstrated for
"liberty". Too, there was a growing spirit of
"German nationalism" in the Danish provinces
of Holstein and South Slesvig, which the Danish
people in general viewed with concern, but which
no one seemed able to do much about, leastwise
King Christian VIII. The restlessness there was
obviously becoming more critical by the hour
when this melancholic, disappointed King died
and his son, Frederick VII, became the country's
Absolute Monarch.

But this new king, who took over in 1848,
was neither loved nor admired; there was much
gossip about him in the Kingdom, since "he had
already wrecked two marriages, and was vague
and moody and not even considered reliable. . ."
So the Danes decided this was the time to do something 
about a few things! A number of leading citizens 
formed a delegation and called upon
<span id="page-70"></span>
Frederick VII and suggested to him that the Danish
people were somewhat "fed up" and were pretty
well set on having more say in matters of State.
Now Danes are apt to call a spade a spade or an
axe an axe any day; they seldom beat-around-the-bush 
or mince words, even with Kings; so it is
supposed that they more or less demanded a new
form of government and struck a blow for "freedom" 
then and there. At least the new King must
have known what they meant, for he acquiesced,
and Absolute Monarchy toppled in Denmark that
year of 1848. A number of meetings were held
in the Capitol and a "constituent assembly"
gathered in order to draw up the plans for a new
constitutional democracy. Almost at the same
time, however, the uprising that had been simmering 
for some time down in the province of Holstein
came to a full boil! A certain member of German
royalty took advantage of things and informed the
people down there that the citizens of Copenhagen
had risen in rebellion and were threatening the
King. The Holsteiners were not interested in the
freedom of the country but only in their own. So,
while the King was engaged in other business, they
considered this a good time to pullout. Thus the
Prince of Noer was able to assume power in the
south and gathered a revolutionary army composed
of Holsteiners and volunteers who streamed in
from other German States to help. They said, if
not in so many words, "Now we Holsteiners are
leaving you, Denmark, and going over to Germany
where our sympathies are, and we're going to take
the whole of Slesvig with us!" And the Danes
apparently believed them and went to war to save
Slesvig. The first battles were won by the Danish,
but when Prussia came in against them Denmark
was terribly upset. The war lasted three years
but there was only fighting during the summer;
every time the sun came out the battles started
again. Finally Prussia withdrew and the Holsteiners 
retreated and the Danes were victorious.
The end came 25 July 1850 and Slesvig and Hol-
stein remained with Denmark. During the course
of the war the "Constituent Assembly" had 
completed its work and on 5 June 1849 the new
constitution was signed. Many Danes began
<span id="page-71"></span>
scratching their heads and talking over this and
that, since all men thirty or past could now vote
and had a greater say in matters.

* * * * *

But the child Else knew naught of these
things; she was growing happily and healthily
under the loving care of Mor Mette and the proud,
watchful eyes of Far Anders. Truly she was after
their hearts! Before her second spring it was well
known in this Danish household that still another
child was on the way; and the father ploughed and
sowed and dreamed of many sons. The golden harvest 
was over and the threshing nearly done when,
on the 12th of Oct. 1848, another daughter came
to that home on the farm in Kjallerup. They named
this one Ane, after Ander's dead sister, with her
second name Kirstine, the same as Mette's, but
they always called her "Stine". She was the fairest
of little ones but less robust than the others. Now
Anders loved his children, but mayhaps he considered 
a majority of females on a farm a poor
arrangement. Possibly he mentioned to his wife
that henceforth they should sleep with an axe under
their bed; the old Scandinavians wagered this was
a sure way to get a boy. But whether or not he
did, or they did, nothing came of it; for on 23 Jan.
1850 another daughter arrived at their cottage. 
She was tiny and sickly, so they had her sprinkling
right away and gave her the name of Edel Marie
Andersen. She died a day past three weeks, 14
Feb. 1850. (Did Anders feel this to be a punishment 
for his undue yearnings for a son?) Later,
on a bitter winter day, they took the little corpse
to the churchyard at Hvidbjerg to be buried, and
the Priest recorded her birth, christening and
death at one and the same time. If Else knew of
her wee sister's passing she soon forgot; for
though she was extremely apt and quick to learn
she was, after all, only just past three when they
laid Edel in her grave.

As Else grew older there were short trips
in the wagon to think of; especially did she enjoy
going to church on Sundays at Hvidbjerg, in her
best frock, starched petticoats and cap (one always
wore the head covered in church) and little 
<span id="page-72"></span>
highbuttoned shoes over hand-knit stockings, always
black. The church was cold and dark inside, both
summer and winter, even with candles burning; but
the walls and ceilings were bright with pictures of
Saints and Angels and garlands of leaves and
flowers, if one could see. The Priest (or Pastor)
in his dark long full robes, with a white ruff at his
chin and a great cross hanging at his back, stood
up in front and drolled out the long prayers and
sermons, which were seldom if ever understood.
There was somebody pumping the organ as it was
being played for hymns. (When she was confirmed
she could have her very own hymn book with her
name on.) On the outside there was the white
church with the cross on top and the big bell
ringing in the tower, the Priest's house or Parsonage, 
and the garden of white tombs, some with
little stone-lambs, where Edel lay;-- Ja, these
she would never forget! Sometimes the family
went to Oveso (Ove Lake); they could walk there
since it was less than a half mile east and a bit
north of their cottage. One of the largest lakes
in Thisted Amt, it ran diagonally from southeast
to northwest a distance of about five miles through
the very center of the county. There it lay, 
glittering in a frame of beech woods, where starlings
made choirs in the trees, and sometimes one saw
a great stork fly up. In summers, fishing boats
with white sails were always drifting there, and
Far Anders often fished there; but usually it was
a family festival that took the rest of them to the
water.

In the day-dark of winter, month after month,
when even the old Danes sometimes wondered if
spring would ever come, the lake was usually
frozen over. The winters in Jutland seemed weary
and long, especially to one as active and eager as
Else. They were always so damp and cold, with
much fog; snow piled higher than a child could see
over, and frost biting nose and fingers. Then
there was always the chill of the rough wind which
came streaking across from the North Sea. The
Andersens lived only about three miles in from
that restless treacherous sea; sometimes they
could hear it moan, as its waves crashed and broke
upon the shore to the west. But still, in winters
<span id="page-73"></span>
there were lessons to be had, for Mette was determined 
that her children were to be well-taught, as
befitted descendants of noblemen! Young Christen,
of course, had been attending school at the Church
school since he was eight, for this had been the
law of the land since Anders and Mette were children. 
But he was not always at Kjallerup, for
sometimes he went to live with Mette's mother,
Bedstemoder Else, in Orum Parish, for she had 
raised him when he was small and he was at home
there. The four younger children had wonderful
times together playing the learning games Mette
had for them. Else liked best the one where you
held up your hand and crooked each finger in turn,
while repeating, "Tommeltot (the thumb), Slikkepot 
(pointer), Langemand (middle finger), Guldbrand
(ring finger), and Lille Peder Spillemand (little
finger)." So, old Guldbrand got to wear the rings!
Mette told her children that many important Danishmen 
in the big cities, and even on the better farms,
wore rings on several fingers, and high silk hats,
coats with polished buttons, and embroidered waistcoats, 
while their womenfolk wore flowered bonnets
and elegant shawls. Someday, if they worked and
studied hard, they too would be important!

In spring the wind went on and on, never
seeming to run out of breath, like an old gossip;
which was perhaps necessary, in the case of the
wind, especially in Jutland, to dry up the land so
farmers could start their ploughing. But very
early in the spring of 1852, when the trees were
still twiggy before the leaves came, Anders didn't
start his ploughing, as he was wont, but went
instead to the police in the nearest place to 
Kjallerup, where they were, to secure authorized
government permission to move his family elsewhere. 
This was the Danish law then. Each adult
Dane possessed a "little Black Book" which had to
be officially marked, or stamped, when consent
was given for a change of residence, and rechecked
when residence was taken up in another place. In
this manner the Kingdom kept track of her people
as they moved around; especially the men of military 
age, who had much difficulty in changing their
areas of abode. Anders wished to sell the farm in
Kjallerup, no doubt, and had perhaps found a good
<span id="page-74"></span>
buyer. He planned to move his family north a few
miles to the somewhat larger town of Norhaa,
closer to the place where his mother was born
and where a number of her kinsfolk dwelt. The
old Karen was longing to be nearer her own people.
Whether the lack of more sons to help on the farm
had anything to do with this is hard to tell, or 
perhaps Mette had visions of a finer cottage in which
to raise her children and give birth to her next
child, which was expected. Permission to move
was granted and what a hustle and bustle and packing 
of things there must have been, Goodbyes had
to be said to neighbors and friends, and Mette's
people in the Parish south had to be visited. 
Certainly they must have gone for the blessing of the
Priest upon their move and his recommendation to
their new Parish; and did they not stop to shed a
tear beside Edel's little mound?

When the wagon was loaded to the hilt they
set out west a quarter of a mile and then turned
onto the wagon road leading northeast a couple of
miles to the village of Istrup, and from thence
around the west tip of Oveso, then skirting the
small village of Legind they followed the muddy
wagon road northwest another two miles until it
joined with the main traveled road at Freskilde,
where they turned and followed this new road west
another mile-and-a-bit to Norhaa, where the
church could be seen all shining white there.

## NORHAA . . . 1852-1862

The Priest in the Parish and town of Norhaa
welcomed farmer Anders Christensen and his family
and entered them on the records, 29 March 1852,
in the following Danish words: Familien er 29 Marts
1852 flyttet til Norhaa Sogn. Her er naevnt:
Gaardmand Anders Christensen 43 aar gl., hans Kone
Mette Kristine Christensdatter 40 aar gl., Aftaegtskone 
Karen Andersdatter 78 aar gl. Deres b&oslash;rn:
Karen Andersen 8 aar gl., Mads Christian Andersen
7 aar gl., Else Cathrine Andersen 5 aar gl., Ane
Kirstine Andersen 3 aar gl. So Else's family moved
to a better farm in Norhaa when she was just a
month and three weeks past five, Her sister Karen
<span id="page-75"></span>
had just turned eight the 18th of March that year
and Mads had his seventh festival just ten days
before, on the 19th of March, the day after Karen's
birthday. Their old grandmother Karen, now 78,
was with them but their half-brother Christen was
not. He perhaps remained in Kjallerup working
for someone, since he was then just turned 13, or
he may have been with Mette's parents down in
Svindborg. Anders had come to their new farm
before the planting season was over, so he would
plough after all that spring; and Mette was in her
nicer cottage in plenty of good time to welcome
the new baby there in Norhaa, 22 Aug. 1852. And
guess what -- it was a bouncing, plump baby girl
whom they christened Sidsel Marie and called
Marie. Her hjemmed&oslash;bt (home baptism) was
recorded as 24 Aug. 1852 and her fremstillingen
i Kirken (recognition of the same in the church)
10 Oct. 1852, all in their new Parish church in
Norhaa.

Young Karen, dark haired and small of
stature, started school for the first time the late
fall of 1852, in the schoolhouse close to the white
church at Norhaa, for she was now eight years old.
The young students who went clogging along in their
wooden shoes through mud and snow, removed them
upon entering the school room and placed them in
individual cubby-holes, assigned to each for that
purpose, before donning soft handmade slippers
instead. The school classes in these farming towns
and villages usually lasted for about six months
each year, from after-harvest in October to before-planting
in April; children were needed on the farms
between times. One teacher for each two grades
was the general rule, with a supervisor, and a
sort of school council or board made up of citizens.
Of course the Parish Priest was the general supervisor, 
over all, and often looked in and listened in
at the school, questioning the pupils, especially
at examination times. Here in these free Church
and State schools young Danes learned to read and
write and were tutored in the literature, history
and geography of their own land. Girls were
instructed in the home-making arts and learned
to hand-sew, embroider, knit and crochet; while
boys were given training in agriculture, care of
<span id="page-76"></span>
farm animals, etc., and also sports competition.
The Danes in general were great admirers of athletic 
ability and both boys and girls were given
gymnastic training. Religious study was had too,
and catechisms were a regular part of the school
program. Each Danish child was to attend school
until age 12 or 14 unless circumstances dictated
otherwise, which was sometimes the case among
the poorer peasant families. The winter nearest
to a child's fourteenth birthday (before or after) he
or she was sent twice a week, for the full six months,
to the Priest's house or Parsonage near the school,
to be taught the fundamentals of the Lutheran Church
by the Priest himself. This was in preparation for
his or her first communion and confirmation. These
important occasions were nearly always held at the
close of the school year in April and looked forward
to with great anticipation by every Danish child; for
after Confirmation one was considered to be an
"adult", as it were, and allowed adult privileges.
Young Christen had joined his mother's family in
time for school that fall, for he would be 14 the
following March and in line for confirmation in
April.

Old Karen was feeble now and had taken to
her bed, but Mette cared for Anders' mother
tenderly, in spite of the new baby and all. This
was an obligation willingly assumed by all upright
Danes; to care well for their aged progenitors and
show them love and give them thanks while there
yet remained the time for giving -- thanks for the
fact that. through them they themselves now lived
and knew the boundless joy there was in living!
This one characteristic alone set the Danish above
people of many other lands; kinship and heredity
were sacred and important to them. January 26th
1853 old Karen passed on, she would have had her
80th festival in less than two more months, for she
was born 12 April 1773. Her grandchildren were
sad at the loss of dear Bedstemoder, for she was
kind to them and had been in the home from their
first memories. Anders was sorely grieved,
though perhaps it was better than a long suffering;
but he knew so little of what was held out for her
on the other side of the grave. Would he ever see
her again? He longed to take her corpse to the
<span id="page-77"></span>
Hvidbjerg churchyard to lay down by his father,
old Christen, but because of the winter weather
and bad roads it seemed impossible. So arrangements 
were made with the Priest in the Parish
there at Norhaa for her funeral and proper burial
or "dirt casting" (jordpaakastelsen). The Priest
preached a good funeral sermon over the old one
as her casket lay in front of him near the pulpit
of the white church and then, as they carried her
coffin outside, the large bell in the belfry began
to toll for her and continued until her casket had
been lowered into the grave-hole. Then the Priest
took his place beside the hole and cast in a little of
the sacred dirt (which he had blessed) which made
a sad little thud upon the wooden casket down below
as he raised his hand to heaven with the words,
"From earth you came; to earth you return; and
from earth you shall come again -- Amen", and
this benediction was the signal for the plain dirt
to be shoveled into the gaping hole, while the black
clothed and hatted mourners stood weeping all
around. No sound could be happier than bells,
no sound could be sadder. And thus Karen Andersdatter 
went to her rest and her reward, and it was
said by some that there was a hovering of all her
ancestors over the land then; for so it was believed
to be when one of the old Danes died.

* * * * *

Young Christen did receive his confirmation
that spring of 1853, at the Parish church in Norhaa,
for so the record there proclaims. It is likely
that he received his Little Black Book (Skudsmaalsbog) 
about the same time also, but it would be difficult 
for him to move around much anyway till he
was 39, because he was of military age now soon
and must be available if the King wanted him in his
army. He could give Anders some help on the new
farm. Young Mads started school that late autumn,
1853. He had been a great help to his father,
gathering and carrying in wood, and water from
the well; taking the cows to the meadow pasture,
with the aid of his little, yapping dog; feeding the
pigs and other farm animals; and with planting,
weeding and harvesting. One never had to worry
about watering the crops in Jutland for the "Great
<span id="page-78"></span>
Provider" took care of that there, as he did elsewhere 
in Denmark; the concern was for enough dry
days. God put the sun in the heavens, sent the rain
and provided the earth, but peasants had to plant
and sow - ja! Yes, evena child's ten fingers
could be a great help on a farm and in a house.

Else too was a fine, strong child with a
willingness to serve. She could gather eggs,
carry small pails of grain to feed chickens and
geese, bring in vegetables from the garden, pick
clean the wool her father sheared and her mother
corded for quilts or spun into yarn for knitting or
loom weaving, and numbers of other small tasks
both in and out the cottage. Mette sought her
second daughter's help often, because of her
cheerfulness and ability, for she herself was
crowded with work from early morning until after
nightfall. Else wondered at her mother's magic
touch with butter and cheese, red-mush, sweet-soup, 
frikadeller, bed med log, little fried and
sugared apple cakes (aebleskiver) Danish soup and
dumplings and Danish homemade beer, etc. Someday 
she herself would learn to cook like Mor, and
spin and weave and knit stockings of all sizes and
mittens, and make high feather beds. Right now
she liked to tend her baby sister most of all; when
the older children were in school she had Marie
mostly to herself and this pleased her and Mor too.
Marie was rolly-polly and slow to learn but Else
loved her just the same as she did her other young
sister, Stine, who was so often sick in winter. In
truth, Else loved all her family, her kith and kin
and everybody, for she was a happy, generous,
loveable person. Though not as pretty as dainty
Karen or fragile Stine, or yet in fact as plump
Marie, still she was well put together and very
intelligent looking, with a high forehead, well
proportioned nose and other excellent features,
but she had the most beautiful hair of all! It fell
to her waist in heavy cascades the color of dark
burnished amber, as if it had been freshly dipped
in liquid Danish "sea-gold". Many of their kinsfolk 
had "red hair"; even Mads' and Stine's was
turned toward that shade; but Else's hair could not
be called red, or yet brown -- it was more the
color of shining "Danish amber", so let it go at
<span id="page-79"></span>
that! Mostly she wore her lovely tresses in two
full, round braids hanging down her back. When
she became confirmed she could wear them as she
chose; perhaps she would wind them into a braided
crown upon her head, like Mor's.

Most likely Else Cathrine started to school
the October before she was 8, as was often the
practice if parents desired it. Mette was especially 
concerned for the education of her children
and would most probably have seen to it. Else
herself must have been anxious and proud to clop
along to the schoolhouse in her wooden shoes that
winter of 1854/55, along with Karen and Mads.
As a caution against the cold she would have worn
besides, long hand knitted woolen stockings well
up over her knees, and a half-sleeved shimmy and
flannel-lined bloomers under a heavy, long-sleeved
wool dress, with coat, cap, mittens and a shawl.
One had to bundle up in winters in Jutland. That
this child's interests in school ran to the reading,
writing and language skills and other academic
pursuits rather than to handicrafts, can be easily
imagined; although she must have learned all that
was necessary of the homemaking arts as well.
Karen was just the opposite; she liked the sewing
and other home arts best, while Mads was inclined
more like his younger sister; he wanted to become
a teacher. That Else gained favor with students,
teachers and the Priest because of her friendly,
eager and industrious nature is also easy to
believe. And who can doubt, having known her,
but that she gathered friends and admirers, as
flowers, along the path which led to her 
womanhood - friends in whom she delighted!

Christmastime was like a bright diamond
laid in the center of winter. No one went to
school then. Preparations began long before the
time, especially where the gathering of supplies
and cooking were concerned. The holiday itself
lasted twelve good days and everybody wanted to
be in on it. Even the shops were opened but half
days for part of the time only, since nobody wanted
to be spending time buying then - nej! There were
the Holy days and the half-Holy days; food in
<span id="page-80"></span>
abundance, presents, and much celebrating and
merriment all around, as well as worshiping in
the church, with many candles lit. There were
lanterns hung at every cottage door in welcome,
garlands of scented boughs hung round inside and
vines of potted house plants traveling over windows
and walls; with the Yule log set to burning on the
hearthstone. The eve before Christmas was the
happiest time of the whole Yuletide, but especially
for the young ones. At 4 p.m. on Dec. 24th, all
businesses and shops closed in the villages and
everybody went home from there. Farm laborers
and house servants were sent home, if they had
homes; otherwise they gathered with the families
of their employers, Then came the big Yule feast
in every cottage, which had been made ready
beforehand. Roasted goose stuffed with apples
and prunes was the favorite, but duck or pork and
Sausage might be had instead. There were always
potatoes, yellow-root (carrots) sweet-and-sour
red cabbage, coffee, tea, beer and all; besides the
"rice mush" or pudding, with an almond hidden in
it - anyone getting the almond won a prize. A bowl
of this was always set out on the doorstep for the
Yule Nissen (Christmas elves) who brought the
presents. Then there were platters of Danish
pastries and other goodies and a wonderful wreathcake, 
to remind one of the crown of thorns.

Afterwards there was the large Yule tree in
the very center of the biggest room, with everything 
hung on it; strings and strings of small paper
flags, little bags of nuts, miniature cookies and
homemade candy of almond paste - one could
hardly name all that was put on. Then came
reading from the Holy Bible about the Christ Child
and the manger-crib, and children thought of all
the little lambs and friendly animals about. Next
came the circling of the tree, with all the family,
young and old, joining hands and singing Yuletide
hymns. Finally all danced around the tree and
ended with a funny song for the little ones, and
that was the signal to break-hands. Then what a
cry went up until the cottage almost shook with
children's voices:--"Presents 
Mor - presents - presents - where are the Yule Nissen 
gifts?" And Mor would hurry out and then bring in a big
<span id="page-81"></span>
bag of presents from the doorstep, where the
Christmas elves had left it, in place of the 
rice-mush. There were always presents for everyone
in Anders' household. When the children were
small there were tops, dolls and little boxes
carved from wood and always a carved figure of
a "Hvid Knight" for Mads. Perhaps there was a
brooch carved from amber for Mor and a watch
chain woven from human hair for Far. As the
children added years there might be amber
brooches for the girls too, and beads and little
amber drops for their pierced ears. Then there
was always something to store away in each girl's
"bride's-chest", besides books for Else and the
others; for had they not hoped for the latest of
Hans Christian Andersen's tales?

From then until Twelfth Night each day had
its celebration. Christmas Day was the first
"Holy-day" and everybody went to the church,
as they did on the following or second Holy-day.
Others were only half-Holy-days, and so on those
days Danes alternated between church, visiting
and entertaining. If the snow fell on and on,
slowly and steadily, folks didn't go very far but
kept to their own neighborhoods; but if the weather
permitted they usually visited at every farmhouse
for miles around, sharing in the festivals of all.
When company came, or even if it didn't, there
was celebrating enough to do at home; games to
be played and prizes for the winners, with Far,
smoking his big pipe, looking on, and dancing,
singing, joke-making and food again! Always
there were open-faced sandwiches and more
pastries with plenty of coffee, tea and beer to
wash them down; but better still, for Else at
least, were the clouds of fragrance from bowls
of Danish soup steaming between islands of
dumplings. For the full twelve days of Yuletide,
Danes ate and ate, then it was easy to forget the
wind and cold outside; but the wonderful days of
Christmas one could never forget - Glaedlig Yul!
On Twelfth Night girls in their teens or even older
ones might well remember the old ritual old
Danes told about. They said if a maiden wished
to know whom she would marry, then on that
night, carrying a shoe in her right hand and
<span id="page-82"></span>
walking backwards to her bed, she should throw
the shoe over her left shoulder, saying at the
same time to the three Holy Kings in a whisper:

>"Show me the very one <br>
Whose bed I must spread <br>
Whose name I must bear <br>
Whose bride I must be." 

Then the man of whom she dreamed that Twelfth
Night was her bridegroom-to-be; but if she lay
dreamless, a future spinster was she! Certainly
Mette's daughters at least thought of such things
as the piles in their brides-chests grew and grew.

* * * * *

It was easy to forget the harshness of winter
when days began to lengthen and the land came out
in holiday attire, In Jutland's countryside summer
was blue sky with patches of grey-blue and pure
white summer clouds over breathless silhouettes:
men at work in the fields; cattle grazing in meadows
of wild hay (a thousand years ago these same meadows 
were navigable waterways haunted by sea
rovers); beautiful lakes and fjords and some gently
rolling hills in places; moorlands and dunes and
lovely sand beaches; large and small farms, stick
fences, windmills, white churches, gentle thatched
cottages, and goose-girls with their buckets of
grain; birds flying over the rooftops; and on the
coasts the flying shapes of ships - how could one
ever forget all these? In summers Else often
went with her father in the wagon or buggy, on
his various trips about the countryside. Anders
loved this capable and willing daughter and, next
to Mads, she was the apple of his eye. On such
occasions she jumped up at the first cockcrow and
was all goose-pimples at the thoughts of it; she
loved the outdoors and she adored being with her
father. Sometimes they'd stay out almost an
entire day. When she was young Far let her hold
the reins, but now she was almost to be confirmed
he taught her to handle the team and she "spelled
him off" with the driving - she had strong hands
and arms. Else had long since learned the gentleness, 
yet firmness, with which horses were to be
used, for she sometimes rode horseback too. The
<span id="page-83"></span>
love of the countryside was in the blood of both
father and daughter, and as they drove along the
taste of salt was in the air and the smell of it in
their nostrils. They lived only a few kilometers, or
miles, due west from the seacoast, although they
had to pass over two or three miles of sand dunes
to get there.

The bracing, briny wind streaking across
Denmark came from the North Sea. It had sculptured 
Jutland's west coastline with wonderful sand
dunes. The sea was always eating away at the land
and casting the chewed-up part back upon the coast
in the shape of shining white sand. And so the
coastline not far west from Else's home was
covered with miles and miles of restless waves
of sand, which, if not tied down with plantings,
would move in upon the people, since the wind
was always there willing to carry them. In the
past, the high dunes had moved like an untamed
sea of sand, wave upon wave, across the cultivated 
fields. Years ago a sandstorm had half
buried the old Skagen Church on Jutland's nose
and it had always been a hard battle to secure a
few fishing ports along the west coast. Though 
bathing beaches closely dotted many parts of both
the east and west coasts of the peninsula, this was
not so along their coastal area; there were no good
bathing beaches close to them. But the many
large and small "pot-holes" among the high dunes
of sand nearby made fine places to picnic away
from sun and wind. For vacationers, wishing a
tan, there was no better place on earth than these
sunbaked dunes; here they too could get sunbaked
and somewhat salt-cured as well. 

Now the Danish government was talking
about planting forests all along Jutland's west
coastline, inland a few miles between the dunes
and the mainland. Another of the farmers enemies,
Far said, was the heathland with its accompanying
heather, which also grabbed away at the land. It
had already started spreading like a blanket over
the old peasant settlements of Denmark. Large
stretches of this were to be broken up, the soil
cleared and crops sown; this would shrink the
moors of Jutland and give the farmers back, some
<span id="page-84"></span>
of their good land. A start was to be made also
on drying up the bogs all over the country, as
well as the marshlands, and damming up shallow
bays and inlets so that large areas of land could
be reclaimed; this was good, Ja!

The waves of the North Sea itself were
rough and dangerous. There was little peace on
the water there. That very year (1860) during a
fierce storm 14 ships had run aground, all within
a comparatively short stretch of Jutland's coastline; 
and Far recalled the old Danes talking about
the biggest wreck in the history of the west coast
of Jutland. It happened on Christmas night of the
very year Mor was born (1811) during the war
against England, when the H.M.S, "St, George"
and H.M.S. "Defense" were cast upon the sandbars. 
Of the combined crews of the two ships
only 11 men were saved - 1,600 were drowned.
To Else, the sea was nothing - let the fish have
it; it was the land she loved!

When they stopped to pass the time of day
over the fences by the neighboring farms, the
talking was of other, more pertinent things:
"The Holsteiners are at it again, still threatening
to take away Slesvig and just looking for an
excuse" - "There's a dirty lot praying with their
hats off; criticizing the State Church right on the
Streets" - "Nej, Nej; we've trouble enough with
those Holsteiners without having religious fanatics
sent in" - "If any of these Mormon preachers come
within sight or sound of our Parish 'twill be the
devil to pay - they'd better stay clear of our
daughters - - !" Then one of the farmers looked
up and caught Else's eyes upon him and leaned
closer towards Anders and whispered something
she could not hear, crossing himself with one
hand while he shook his timber axe with the other,
and Anders swore a curse out loud and whispered
something back. Then the farmer continued on in
louder tones, "They are in Aalborg now these past
ten years, but only the poor and ignorant peasants
there listen - -." And so the talk went on at every
farm in the same guttural voices, words spewed
out in harsh grunt-like sounds, as if the speakers
mouths were full of potatoes; for so they spoke in
<span id="page-85"></span>
all of Thyland; they had a special Danish of their
own. All seemed to work themselves up to
lathers as they spoke and Else wondered, as she
sat holding the reins, "Was it then so bad?" She
had heard a bit of talk before about these people;
the Priest had mentioned them one day in school,
with much scorn, but she had thought not much of
it before. Anders said more of it as they drove
along home and though he was naturally a quiet-
spoken man, he was much exercised about these
so-called "Mormons" and took it out on the 
unsuspecting horses: "If they ever come here I'll
- - - 'Crack' - - he brought his whip down on the 
innocent beasts, and in the jolting and bumping that
followed, Else failed to hear what he planned to
do then, and she never found out until years later.

* * * * *

Else Cathrine Andersen's confirmation took
place the following April (1861) two months after
her fourteenth festival. It was a fine affair,
almost as wonderful as a wedding perhaps; and
she could say with all her heart that her parents
had spared nothing, for Mette certainly knew the
importance of the occasion and had seen to it that
her second daughter was fitted out for the splendid
affair in the very best manner they could afford.
She had a long white dress over full, stiffly
starched underskirts, white stockings, white
linen buttoned shoes, white ribbon bows on her
two long amber braids, and a white embroidered
shawl for her shoulders afterwards, and a flowered
bonnet as well, Mor never forgot anything! There
was a new hymn book all her own with her own
name on it in gilt and a sweet little "Dagmar
Cross"! on a chain for her neck. Else had heard
that some peasants even mortgaged their farms
to give their daughters proper confirmations, and
perhaps encourage better marriages for them; but
Anders was happy to be able to afford these things
for Else, for he had prospered in Norhaa. Of all
his daughters, Else was the most liked, and even
the Priest had said it. He thought she had a future
in the schoolroom, should she so desire, and mentioned 
that he would be pleased to recommend her.
Else thought she had never been happier or felt so
<span id="page-86"></span>
loved and blessed.

Several years before (1857) a law had been
made in Denmark requiring all present Danes to
change their surnames and take the same one as
their fathers, This meant that the Andersen
children should now go by the surname of Christensen, 
as Anders did. But Danes were slow to change,
especially Jutlanders, and this had taken some
thinking about and in Thisted it was not too well
enforced, as yet. Young Christen had never gone
by the name Andersen, but Christensen, as he was
christened, so he had no problem. Mads, on the
other hand, decided on.a big change and soon after.
his confirmation began using the surname Hvid
(the modern spelling of Hviid, from his mother's
father's side). Mette must have been happy about
this, thinking that it gave her second son some 
distinction to be called by a nobleman's name - so
Mads Christian Hvid his name remained from that
time on. The Andersen sisters decided against
the surname change for the present, at least; it
would be time enough to change when they were
married! Else Cathrine however, a little bolder
than the rest and now fully confirmed, decided to
compromise and changed the spelling of her middle
name instead, from Cathrine, as she was christened,
to Kathrine, with a K, the more popular way then;
'twas something she had long kept in her mind.

The northern summer is almost like a paradise 
on earth, especially for one whose eyes are
open to the beauties of nature, so sublime and
grand, and whose ears are attuned to the trills of
the skylark, the charming tones of the nightingale
and other singing birds. One cannot help but inhale
the invigorating summer breezes and enjoy the
aroma that flows from flora's bosom. And so it
was in Denmark, where the temperature varied
between 60-80&deg;, The long, mild days, never too
hot, in which one could read a newspaper by daylight 
up to 10 o'clock at night, were all too few for
Else. In midsummer there were frequently 15
hours of sunshine daily, and one could hear happy
children playing in the streets, having their hours
of romping often until nearly midnight. The parks
and city boulevards were filled with promenaders

<span id="page-86a"></span>
![Map of Thy](./images/05.png)

<span id="page-87"></span>
until long after that and small groups of men and
women could be seen chatting together, while
love-sick couples strolled hand in hand or seated
themselves on comfortable benches in the parks
or by cottage doors. The nights were short and
light, but somewhat cool. On a clear night one
could sometimes catch a glimpse of the "Northern
Lights". Pleasure boats cruised on lakes and
fjords and in bays and harbors and huge sailing
vessels, at half speed, glided in and out of the
larger water ways.

In Norhaa the Andersen girls often sat long
together on the bench outside their doorstep, the
older ones doing handwork for their brides-chest,
while Mads squatted near by whittling away with a
knife. They joked, laughed and chatted and told
of their plans for the future. Karen was now
employed in an embroidery shop but hoped to
attend the Folk High School the coming winter, to
learn more of fine sewing and to spin and weave.
Mads for sure would be a teacher, but first he
must do farm work and save his money, then he
too would attend High School in winter. Else was
undecided, the restless current of Viking blood
in her veins kept her uneasy. She longed to see
more of the world. They had never been to a city
of any size at all, none of them, but only a few
miles north or south to visit relatives or east and
west for brief excursions with their father, or on
picnics somewhere together. What was it like in
Kobenhavn? Neither Far or Mor had ever been
that far away, as peasant Danes traveled little
then, especially those so removed from the center
of things in northwest Jutland, even the better
class ones. Sometimes in summer, between
planting and harvest, relatives from both sides
came to see them. Else's godmother, Aunt Inger
Cathrine Christensdatter and her husband, Peter
Larsen, came that year. Their oldest son had
died that past winter but they brought their seven
other children with them. The two older girls
were spinsters and sorry for it, but Ann Margrete
was just Else's age and such good company.
Onkel Peter had a big black moustache that tickled
when he kissed her; he always insisted on kissing
<span id="page-88"></span>
all his nieces no matter how big they had grown.

Friends from school and the neighboring
farm cottages came too, to sit, or walk and talk
with the Andersen youths, but there were few
young men among them. Mette had her eyes peeled
for marriageable males for her daughters; she had
four of them to worry about and Karen now was of
the age, and soon Else. Mor sometimes spoke of
marriage to them and dwelt on the importance of
being wed to someone from the better 
class; -- "for when you choose your life's mate", 
she counseled, "it is the whole future of your own blood
that you are choosing." To Else this, for her,
seemed far in the future.

## BESTED . . . 1862-1865

It so happened that the late autumn of 1862
found Else enrolling in the Folk High School at
Bested (sometimes written as Bedsted), one of
the larger places in Thisted Amt, though not a
big one as cities go. Though it was only four or
so miles due south of N&oslash;rhaa, across Oves&oslash; and
down, one had to travel there around the lake some
twelve miles east past Snedstrup, then turning
south at Stagstrup on southwest past several small
farm villages to the town of Hassing, and from
there still a bit farther west, Anders took her in
the wagon, for she had so many things, and gave
her the fee for her registration. She was to live
at the school with the other students and assist in
the cooking, cleaning, or anything else required of
her, for this was the custom then at those schools.
Though she hoped to spend Yule vacation at home,
there were tears when Else bid her father goodbye - how
she would miss him! She had brought along
her little identification book with the official seal
upon it; 'twas the first time she had found occasion
to use it since receiving it soon after her confirmation.
She was really an adult now, away on her own
at boarding school in a city of some size, with her
very own roommates. But afterall she was soon
sixteen - many Danish girls were married by that age.

The Folk High Schools of Denmark had been
<span id="page-89"></span>
first organized the year 1844 by the Lutheran
Bishop N.F.S. Grundtvig, spiritual revivalist of
the Danish people. There were only a few of these
schools to begin with but their popularity had grown
until they were becoming nation-wide. (Later on
practically all young people in the rural areas, who
could afford it, attended for additional post-school
education, and these old high schools are still in
existence in Denmark and have recently enjoyed a
revival of their popularity all over the Kingdom.)
This movement brought about a tremendous, enthusiastic 
elevation of the intellectual standards, even
in Else's time. There were still few enough of
these schools in the year 1862, and fewer still, in
far northern Jutland. The city of Bested was fortunate 
to have one. Here Else found gay young 
women learning to spin, weave and sew; others
simply improving their general knowledge; and
still others, like herself, hoping to specialize in
education, literature, history, etc., in order to
qualify as teachers in the various Parish schools.
Young men too, and even older ones, were there
learning more of practical farming and, when farm
work was slack, they too studied literature, biography, 
etc. So here in Bested was one of these
peasant "schools of life", and Else Kathrine
Andersen was one of the fortunate ones to be
learning there.

But she could scarcely wait for the Christmas 
vacation. Never had she been so long away
from those she loved. The day before Christmas
Eve, since the weather was mild for winter, Far
came to bring her home for the celebrations.
"What are we having for the Yule feast - roast
goose?" There were so many questions to be
asked and answered on both sides as father and
daughter rode along towards N&oslash;rhaa. Did Karen
have a suitor yet? "Nej." "Was Stine looking
well to her studies for her confirmation next
spring?" "Ja,"--but she has been sick and
missed some." Then it was Anders' turn for the
questions. "Have you seen ought of those 'Mormon
Dippers' there in Bested?" (This was something
that had been worrying him.) "Nej." But Else
had heard from her roommates that some were
holding meetings near by. Then Far changed the
<span id="page-90"></span>
subject: "Are there nice young men at the High
School then?" "Ja, ja," she said, blushing some,
"But for these I have no concern!" Her father
clucked his tongue and shook his head. "Nej, nej,
are our daughters now to be all spinsters?" Then
he smiled from the corner of his eye and winked at
her,"There's plenty time yet".

"Welcome, welcome" was Mette's greeting
as she hugged her second daughter to her, There
was such excitement at her homecoming! What a
warm, friendly, merry household was here. This
turned out to be the gayest Yuletide of all. The
girls could scarcely get through one mess of dishes
and turn around till another group of company came.
Many relatives and all Else's old friends called in,
seeming happy to bid her welcome home again, if
only for Yule. She was a favorite with young and
old for she was not as shy as the generous, warmhearted 
Karen or yet as the sweet, courageous
Stine, Little Marie was more outgoing and conversant, 
like her, but somewhat flighty. Else's
happiest hours of all were the quieter ones, there
with her family all about her. How she loved them!
One had to get away Sometimes to view ones blessings 
in a clearer light. Surely she had lived as
rich a youth as was granted only a few!

* * * * *

As Else listened to the preaching of the
famous Bishop Grundtvig, when he came to talk
to them there at the school in Bested that mid-winter, 
her blood was stirred with an urgency to
achieve, He talked of faith but said that work too
was important. Danish youths must improve their
minds and skills if they were to save the future of
Denmark. Praying was important and necessary,
but not enough. Other lecturers came to the school
occasionally and sometimes the older male students
stood up and told of their experiences. The Pastor
or Priest of the Parish church there at Bested was
often there to preach. One time he chided the
younger students for not attending the services in
the church and urged them to attend, lest their
souls should be lost. Else was guilty, as were
most of the others; the services were so dull it
was scarcely worth their time to go. There were
<span id="page-91"></span>
many Danes, even old ones, who never stepped
inside the churches except for special occasions
such as baptisms, weddings, funerals and burials,
and of course, confirmations. Since the new constitution 
some twelve years before, baptism in the
Lutheran church was no longer compulsory - but
children must be washed of their sins before death!
To be legally married one had to go to the Priest
and one couldn't dream of having his loved ones
buried elsewhere than in the churchyard. All
Danish boys and girls, wanted to be confirmed, this
too was important; yes, these things most Danes
attended to, otherwise they let the church just
stand ther. (In Denmark, even at the present
time, the average attendance at the Lutheran
Church is less than 2% of its membership; yet
90% of the people come to obtain their confirma-
tions.)

One morning, a few Sabbaths after the
Priest's scolding, Else and some of her roommates 
attended the meeting at his church. There
were a number of the other young students there
also, for the Priest's talk had roused them. Now
this "holy man" took good advantage of his young,
captive audience that morning to unleash a torrential, 
verbal blast against the intrusion of some of
the "devil's advocates" into their peaceful Parish.
He urged his listeners to "go forward, armed with
righteousness and break up the gatherings of these
vile blasphemers who dared to call themselves
'Saints'. Drive them from our midst and let these
'godless Mormons' know that there is no place for
them here among Christians!" Then the Priest
read from a recent K&oslash;benhavn newspaper what
the press there had to say of them and it was bad
indeed. Else thought she had never heard such
rantings and goings-on from any pulpit before,
even against the "evil one" himself. A group of
young men gathered around the Priest afterwards,
but Else and her friends hurried back to the high
school, talking excitedly together. One of the
older girls whom they respected put in a good
word for the accused Mormons; saying these had
every right to worship as they chose, the new 
constitution guaranteed them that. Though public
meetings had been banned for them in some places
<span id="page-92"></span>
heretofore, it was not so in Bested; the Mormons
had bothered few here. It was no longer American
preachers only who led these people, for many good
Danes were now among them. Else had seen some
of these and they were not evil looking or speaking,
but fine appearing, upright young men. Besides,
one could not always believe what the Priests said
for they could not agree but fought among themselves 
as to what was right or what was wrong to
preach. The older girl begged the others to say
naught, at school or elsewhere, of her remarks
and swore them to secrecy - there was no need to
stir things up. But there was plenty of talk at the
school the next day about "those Mormons" regardless. 
It seemed that some rough fellows had
broken into their meeting place there on the outskirts 
of Bested the night before and attacked their
two preachers. These were mocked and beaten
and their coats torn from their backs. It was a
good thing that the police finally came to stop it
or all the congregation of them would have gotten
the same treatment; 'twas doubtful that any Mormon 
trash would ever come back there to pray and
preach. Some of the attacking mob had been jailed
overnight and then released, but others got away.
It was suspicioned that some of the latter might
have been young students from the High School and
there was talk of an investigation, but no one thought
in the least that there would be one, nor was there.
"Indeed?" Else looked at the young men she had
seen with the Priest at the church last morning and
held her tongue, but her thoughts said it for her,
"Is this then so Christian?"

* * * * *

Winter slid into spring, then all the north
came blooming into summer and Else had good
news when she returned home then. They were
pleased with her at the school and said if she would
return there the following winter term they would
be happy to recommend her to the children's school
in Bested for a position the following year. Far
and Mor were well pleased at the word and proud
too. They had many fine dreams they had dreamed
for their children. But too, Else had some things
perplexing her in her heart, of which she dared not
<span id="page-93"></span>
speak. But these were soon mostly forgotten in
the joy of being home again with her beloved family.
All were there this summer except Christen, who
had gone in the army. He was a roamer anyway
and seldom at N&oslash;rhaa of late, for he had taken up
with rough men. Karen was still working in the
embroidery shop there and Stine was fully confirmed 
now, though she was not at all well. She
had an asthmatic condition but was better some in
summers and so courageous and patient withal.
Northwest Jutland was bad for asthma sufferers
and there were plenty of them there. Mads,
eighteen now, might have to go in the army too,
if there was any unrest in the country; but now he
was helping Far on the farm and with the cattle,
and things had gone well with those. Marie, bless
her heart, would soon have her eleventh festival,
they would all celebrate it with her; she was the
only summer-born member of the entire family.

Else rode with her father again and there
was talk over the fences of "those awful Mormons - thousands
of them there were now in the country";
but there was greater talk of Holstein and Slesvig
this summer in N&oslash;rhaa. Everyone was sick of
that question - it was time the government did
something about it! She discussed this problem
with her father but of the things that trembled
hardest on her lips she dared not speak. She
sat near her mother, as Mette fetched the butter
churn from the closet and then bore in some pans
of milk and skimmed them, and while she churned
they talked of many things, did other tasks like
spinning or weaving or sewing carpet rags. There
was always something to put ones hands to. She
too could do these things now and cook well too
and help with the milking; but for fine sewing she
cared little. Mette did most of the talking and
gave much advice, when they were together; Else
wished she could speak to her of what was in her
heart. She walked and talked and sat and sang
with her sisters and Mads, and they even practiced
dancing together, like they did at the school, and
gymnastics. Would they ever be so carefree
again? And so the summer flew away and it was
harvest time and the threshers came; they no
longer had to thresh their grain with flails in the
<span id="page-94"></span>
barn, as before, but they still gathered the fresh
straw for bed tickings and to place under the newly
woven carpet, Soon it was time to leave for school
again and Else had not yet opened her heart fully to
anyone at home.

* * * * *

The constant headache was the Slesvig
question. The German Confederation (of which
Holstein was a member) was constantly interfering
with Denmark's relationship with her two southern
provinces, Slesvig and Holstein, This problem
had been supposedly settled more than ten years
before, by international treaty, but the Germans
wouldn't let things alone and kept trying to draw
Slesvig into the Confederation too, in order to
take both the provinces away from Denmark's rule
eventually. There was constant trouble down there
and finally the Danish government's patience was
exhausted. It was decided to settle the question
once and for all, radically, by incorporating Slesvig
definitely into Denmark as a State instead of a
Province. This was a dangerous step, for it
meant that Denmark would be breaking the peace
treaty that had been honored for some more than
400 years, since the time the Danish King,
Christian I, proclaimed that Slesvig and Holstein
should be "forever undivided". Naturally the
government realized this situation was a serious
one but, in spite of it, an act to this effect was
passed by the Danish parliament Friday evening
13 Nov. 1863. It needed only the King's signature
to make it into law. Two days later, Sunday 15
Nov., King Frederick VII died at Glucksburg
Castle, before having had time to sign the act.

Everyone realized the situation was acute
and there was talk in every city and village.
"When the news reached K&oslash;benhavn by telegram
on Sunday evening, all theatres stopped their
performances, guns on the coastal fortresses
thundered out a mourning salute for the last King
of the old Royal House, and tens of thousands of
people filled the streets leading in towards
Christianborg Palace, where the Prime Minister,
Hall, with the traditional cry of,"The King is
dead, long live the King !" proclaimed Prince
<span id="page-95"></span>
Christian of Glucksburg, Christian IX, King of
Denmark"; according to the provisions for the
succession agreed upon by international treaty at
London, England 8 May 1852. The new King was
faced with the immediate problem and it took him
three days to decide to sign this act, known as the
"November Constitution".

But there was no dilly-dallying down in
Germany; here the effect was immediate and 
Denmark was presented with a carefully calculated
ultimatum right away demanding that the new act
be repealed. Opinions in the country were sharply
divided; the government resigned in anger and a
mew one was formed, The regular Danish army,
stationed in Holstein, was withdrawn from there
back to the southern border of Slesvig, to demonstrate 
that Denmark had no intention of retaining
Holstein any longer - Germany could have the
trouble maker! But the act was not repealed and
the Danes' army took upits position at Danevirke,
the 1,000 year old border defense embankment on
Slesvig's south border. The troops were requested
to hold this position until spring. Danes usually
only fought in summers and had no idea there
would be much doing before that.

Preparedness simply wasn't one of the Danes'
strong points, especially where war was concerned. 
One sometimes had the feeling that the
Danish outlook had never developed beyond the
idea that, in time of war, one took his rusty
battle axe down from the wall or went to try and
find it in the woodshed where it had been serving
a useful purpose, and sharpened it on a grindstone.
It was difficult to make these people realize, in
peacetime, that newer forms of war required
materials and preparations which could not be
produced when the enemy suddenly appeared in
your paddock. The Danes were too tied up with
everyday life and too busy enjoying it, and blessed
with too great a sense of humor to be eternally on
guard,

* * * * *

Christmas that year in N&oslash;rhaa was hardly
noticed by the majority, except that people met in
<span id="page-96"></span>
the church on Holy days and sang hymns about the
"Fatherland" under silent bells, and prayed for
peace and the safety of their soldiers. So many of
the young men from the town and surrounding villages 
were in the army now for it had been built up,
in case. Christen was down at Danevirke. Mads
wanted to go, but Mor clung on to him and wept; he
was not the age yet until spring; perhaps there
would be no war or it would be over before then
and he would "draw a pass". But Mette was not
all tears; in truth she was rather excited about a
family of old acquaintances of hers who had
recently moved to N&oslash;rhaa. A good family, of the
better class, trades-people and of the nobility too,
way back -- besides, they had a marriageable son!
He was a little older and well-traveled, and had not
long since returned from K&oslash;benhavn. (Mor had it
from the neighbors that he was "looking" and would
fain have himself a wife from N&oslash;rhaa. She was
anxious that he should meet her daughters and had
invited his family to tea at mid-Yule.)

Else would have spared herself and gone elsewhere 
when Mor's old friends came; she was not in
the marriage market and had no mind to be stared
at, up and down, by any wife-hunter! But Mor
kept her eye on her the live long day. Luckily the
talked-of-son didn't come with his parents to tea,
but Else was stared at nevertheless, and asked
many questions by the visitors, as was her sister
Karen, who blushed and stammered some at each;
and Else knew they questioned Mor too, on the side.
All the rest of Yuletide her mother kept buttering-up 
the not-so-young man in her presence, at every
opportunity, till she grew sick of his very name,
could she remember it. On the twelfth day of
Yuletide however, the son himself called, unexpectedly, 
to pay his respects to the family and ask
their pardon for not coming before. Else tried to
withdraw but was not quick enough; she hoped he
would set his eyes on Karen, for she was so willing 
for a suitor. She could tell Mads liked him right
away. He turned out to be well educated, by his
conversation, and witty and pleasant too. True,
he was a bachelor, but not as old as some, and he
was rather good looking, in the Danish way, and
taller than Mads and taller than her too. Mette
<span id="page-97"></span>
fussed over their visitor, smiling all the time, and
you could see right away that she had her heart set
on something. As the visit drew to a close, Else
thought that she could like this fellow, but when he
pressed her hand in goodbye she knew she could
indeed! But whether she threw her shoe over her
left shoulder that Twelfth Night or dreamed of anyone, 
only she herself knew--likely she dreamed of
war.

* * * * *

Then it was no longer just a rumor but became 
known for sure that Otto von Bismark, who
had just become Prussia's Minister of State, had
readied his newly built-up army, joined forces
with Austria, and was preparing to back up the
Holsteiners and march against the Danes' army at
Danekirke, winter or not. He wanted war, and
the chance to try out his new troops and impress
the Prussian King and the Prussian people themselves 
and show just what this new army of his
was worth. The excitement in Denmark became
so great at the thought that one could imagine
hearing swords clashing in the sky! But that was
only the beginning, for when it was announced that
the Holsteiners had freed a thousand convicts to
march against Jutland, everybody eligible there
joined up. Suddenly men and boys were marching
on every road and Mads was with them; Mette had
no longer been able to restrain him. People came
running on every road too, to tell the latest news,
and hurried to the towns and stood around on the
squares while the bands played under flying flags,
In every house girls picked lint, not knowing for
what purpose exactly, except that it had something
to do with the firing of guns. Farm hands helped
make cartridges at the school houses and practiced 
shooting, day after day, and the most
ordinary peasants spoke passionately of dying
willingly for Denmark, shaking their shovels and
pitchforks and calling back and forth over their
fields. Yes, war was all drums and flags and
passion at first, but after that came the killing!

To Danish minds "Danevirke" was a myth
surrounded by historical romanticism; for actually
the embankment was useless. In most places it
<span id="page-98"></span>
had long since collapsed or been washed away.
Originally, only the eastern boundary had required
defending, for the country to the west was all bog
and marshland. But now it had dried up considerably, 
and furthermore the meadows and marshes
froze over and thereby became as firm as the rest
of the land. Here then at Danevirke were gathered
40,000 Danish men, hoping to hold a front some 60
miles long, if and when the enemy attacked.
General de Meza, who had the full confidence of his
troops and the reputation of being fearless, was a
"cool commander". He spent his time at his headquarters 
setting French sonnets to music or
designing ivory handles for his broom. He was
meticulously careful about his health and fussed
endlessly over his uniform and his white gloves,
even though war was at his very tent door and the
enemy was taking its position near by to prove it!
One morning, after taking his regular ride around
his defense lines he wrote in his diary,"I was
shot at! I do not understand what they think they
are doing."

Feb. lst, 1864, the combined Austro-Prussian 
army of 60,000 crossed the Holstein
border and marched northward. It would have
been impossible for General de Meza's outnumbered
forces to hold Danevirke against them, and he knew
it. He called a retreat of his troops and in the
middle of the night of Feb. 5th, the whole Danish
army crept stealthily away toward the north, over
iced-up roads and with a fierce snow storm blowing
full in the faces of its endless, trudging columns.
After hours and hours of weary marching the Danes
set up their new defenses at Dybboel Hill, where
there was a chain of ten rather small earthworks.
Their enemy had noticed nothing till next morning,
but then immediately took up the pursuit.

Throughout all Denmark the news of the
Danes' withdrawal from Danevirke, their ancient
defense line, glamorized by tradition, gave the
Danish subjects a jolt and the shock was almost
more than they could bear. A great howl went up,
and the people wept and wrung their hands and
mourned as they had not done for generations.
The government, fearful of the blame, hurridly
<span id="page-99"></span>
made a scapegoat of General de Meza and had him
dismissed, (Some said he was a traitor!) This
was an unpopular political move, grievously unjust
and gravely unwise; but that was not all. The fact
began to sink in that Denmark's present allies,
England, Russia, Norway and Sweden, had no
intention of coming to her aid, as the Danes had
fully expected them to do, but simply stood by and
let her go-it-alone against ambitious, war-thirsty
Austria and Prussia (who within a few decades
were to consolidate into the powerful German
Empire).

As these forces gathered against the greatly
outnumbered Danish troops, they were also better
trained and better equipped with infinitely superior
arms, having breech-loading rifles capable of
firing off a dozen or more rounds for every one
fired by the Danes' old muzzle loaders, as well
as being much more accurate and far-shooting.
Their artillery too was far superior, which was
to prove catastrophic for the Danish positions at
Dybboel. The Germans dug themselves into zig-zag 
trenches a few hundred yards from the hill,
across a wide fjord, and kept firing away until
they had completely destroyed the earthworks
there. But still the Danish clung to it, week after
week, while day after day their soldiers marched
up the highway and relieved each other in the
shattered redoubts, or lay encamped on the muddy
winter fields, and let themselves be shot at.

* * * * *

Else Kathrine sat in her room at the High
School in Bested, with her Bible before her.
Mads' letter lay there too where she had dropped
it. "The news from the front is not good", he had
written, "all this marching, marching in the mud
and snow, with nothing but hardtack and three
shillings a day. The soldiers all set up in front
to be shot at while the officers ride safe behind",
He had made light of it but she knew it must be
frightful in all that cold and shooting. Christen,
he had said, was among those missing at Dybboel
Hill. (She had wept silently at this, for she was
fond of her half brother in spite of his rough ways,
and her heart ached for Mette too -- he was her
<span id="page-100"></span>
first-born.) Mads said he had seen their visitor
of last Twelfth-Day, the tradesman's son, during
the retreat from Danevirke, and he had asked
about her. (So he was in it also!) So far, Mads
himself was unscathed, but only heaven knew how
long that would be so, for hundreds were wounded
and dead already. (She had prayed nightly for
Mads' safety, and the rest.) Her thoughts ran back
and forth continually. How frightened she had been
recently, the nights of Feb. 13th and 14th to be
exact, when that terrible wind visited Jutland,
blowing down houses and uprooting trees everywhere 
in a wild fury, as if heaven itself was in on
it! The very schoolhouse had seemed to rock to
and fro like a drunken man, and she had wondered
then if the great judgment was about to come upon
them.

Else drew a sheet of paper from between the
pages of her Bible, as she sat, and casting her
eyes furtively here and there to make certain she
was unobserved, unfolded it and read what was
printed for the dozenth time or more: "A Voice
of Warning! The day is at hand when kingdoms,
governments, thrones, are falling; plagues,
pestilence, famine are walking abroad; whirlwinds, 
earthquakes, wars, proclaim the truth of
prophecy. . ." It was foolish to chance being
caught with such writings - she must tuck the
Mormon tract back into the Holy Book again. As
she reached for the Bible to do so, a certain line
of type, where it lay open, held her gaze: "And I
saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kingdom
and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice,
Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of
his judgment is come. . ." Ja, Ja, this was the
very passage of scripture Elder Hansen had
referred to at their last meeting.

There were only girl students at the High
School now and they spent most of their time doing
war work, inquiring after their fathers, brothers
or sweethearts at the front, or discussing excitedly
all the news and rumors which came their way.
Their young voices shook with emotion when they
<span id="page-101"></span>
talked of the foe shooting its way up into North
Jutland. Should these Germans gain a great
victory in the end Little Denmark might even be
obliterated, or at least divided up between the
German states and other powers. Ja, Jutland
would go to Germany, for was it not well known
that "what the German Eagle got its claws into
it never relinquished"? There was much said
among them also about a hired maid at the school,
who had been sharply dismissed recently from
her position there, although she had no place else
to go to earn a living. It was whispered that she
had been "taken in by those Mormons" and was
even planning to be "d&oslash;bt" in their church. A pity
it was and a disgrace for all her kindred! The
whole affair was supposed to have been kept under
cover, of course, lest the school officials be
accused of over-leniency. Then there was talk of
what the Priest had said when he had come to the
High School the past week and delivered a scathing
discourse on the evils and perils of joining-up with
"that sorry lot of blasphemous sinners!" Then
everybody there had been as fired up and in arms
against 'those Mormons"as they were against
"those Germans" and still were: -- well almost
everybody there, that was. How little most of
them knew after all.

There were no L. D. S. cottage meetings
being held then in Bested for the Danish Elders
who had been there conducting them had emigrated
to Zion Land quickly, when the war looked imminent,
or had been forced into the army. Elder Lars
Hansen was among the latter; Else supposed he
too had been fighting at Dybboel with the rest.
She had first met him at a Mormon meeting early
the past spring, where she had gone, at the invitation 
of her last year's roommate, to see and hear
the Mormons for herself. Her whole way of
believing had been changed from that time on as
she had marveled at each new gospel message
given. This winter she had been present at many
more Mormon meetings and her heart and soul
burned with the truthfulness of the things she had
heard. Her great desire was that her precious
family should also hear and believe these wonderful 
new doctrines.
<span id="page-102"></span>

At sea, the Danish fleet remained superior,
as usual, and kept the German ships from coming
in to help, but the German troops needed no help
from anybody. They took Dybboel Hill from the
Danes, who had hung onto it desperately for eight
weeks against the great odds, A terrific bombardment, 
18 Apr, 1864, drove out the last of the
brave defenders, who pushed north to Fredericia,
last remaining fortress in Jutland, and from thence
evacuated the peninsula and scattered to the various
islands, leaving the whole of it in the hands of the
Germans, who by now outnumbered the Danish
soldiers by perhaps ten to one. The Danes had
lost upwards of 5,000 dead, wounded or prisoners,
while the enemy's losses were set at about 1,200.
The victors soon took possession of both North and 
South Jutland and oppressed the people by collecting 
one war tax after another in rapid succession, though
they never crossed over to the Islands. They won what they
were after, for the discouraged Danes gave up at last, and
the Peace Treaty, 1 Aug. 1864, gave the Austro-Prussian
Germans all of Holstein, Laurenburg, and almost all of Slesvig
(Schleswig).  The final terms were not ratified
until 30 Oct., at which time Denmark was required to give back 
all the German warships her navy had captured, besides.
So for a time the hated enemy reighned supreme in North and 
South Jutland, and forced the Danish officials to collect 
their taxes. Peace being finally restored, the hostile armies 
vacated, having nearly ruined the land by heavy taxations 
and general depression of business, which was the unavoidable 
consequence of the war.

In the meantime the reduced family of farmer
Anders C. Christensen went about its own business
as much as possible and and attempted to right itself 
after the upset to the country, and carry on in 
N&oslash;rhaa. There were no male helpers at home, or 
to hire, so Anders sought the aid of his daughters.
Else, having returned from High School and being the 
most skilled at outdoor things, worked side-by-side with
her father, planting, milking, and even shearing the 
sheep they kept for their own use.  She could shear 
as sheep or drive a team as well
<span id="page-103"></span>
as any man. She was now of slightly more than
medium stature, strong, straight and well-proportioned; 
a capable, gifted young woman from
the Vikings way back in a straight line, and from
the nobles too, on her mother's father's side.
Next winter she would be a full fledged teacher
and work with children in a school in Bested.

But there was one thought foremost in the
mind of Else Kathrine Andersen as she worked
and planned ahead. One day she said to her
father, -- "Are you never afraid of the day when
you must stand before God's judgment?" Looking
sideways at her he answered, "'Twill be time
enough when the old bell tolls for me!" She had
hoped to engage him in serious conversation about
the life hereafter but never could seem to. He
was not a religious man. Mette too was hard to
approach on these matters, for her mind was so
well occupied with material things, besides being
intent on keeping a home of refinement befitting
descendants of noblemen; also, it seemed, there
was that never ending question of husbands for her
daughters. So many country girls never had
proper chances to marry and now so many young
Danishmen were losing their lives in the war.

With the beginning of August the Danish
soldiers began trickling home. One happy day
Mads returned to N&oslash;rhaa and he was well and
whole; it was not like this with all who were
mustered out. There was joy in the household
of Anders and Mette then, and they put out flags
to show it! Else threw her arms around her
brother in embrace and exclaimed, "We must
thank the gracious Lord for sending you back
safely to us." But Mads laughed, "Nej, it is
those Germans we should thank for being such
poor shots." Then Mette chipped in, -- "Ja,
we are all such weak people, and since we can
do nothing for ourselves all is spoiled for us;
everything must be given us from above by the
Great God Father." "But we are not puppets",
Else had cried, "to be moved around by strings.
Ja, we are weak but we can be strong -- so much
in the end depends on us ourselves, Don't you
see that God expects us to strive and sacrifice for
<span id="page-104"></span>
his blessings; to work out our own salvations and
earn our own places in his: kingdom?" She was
sobbing then, but with the rest there was silence,
and each one looked at her in some strange way.
Presently Far shook his head; "It is the bitterness
of this war and the future of our kingdom that
worries us all and makes us think strange thoughts.
Our Else has been working too hard, but now that
Mads has come it will be eased for her." And
that was the end of that.

Christen didn't come then; perhaps he was a
prisoner, since there had been no word of him
among the thousands dead and wounded. It was 
the prisoners who would come last. Word had it
that the tradesman's son had returned home and
nothing would do but that Mette should send Mads
over there right away to invite him and his family
to a celebration for the return of their sons. Else
seemed to forget all her worries about Christen in
the possibilities of it. It is probable that the
invited family came, but that their son came and
came again and again was surely so; for Rudolph,
the tradesman's son, had set his heart and mind
on Else Andersen when first he saw her. (We
shall call him Rudolph, for lack of a better name
having been told us.)

Those were happy days for Else then, in
spite of the battling of her thoughts. It was more
often Rudolph now who sat with her on the bench
by the cottage door, listening to the nightingales
cry, or walked hand in hand with her in the fragrant
autumn evenings, as they talked and came to know
each other better. He listened attentively to her
when she spoke of her new-found wisdom, which
was more than her family seemed to do, to any
good purpose. But she dared not tell him yet
half of what she was thinking. He agreed with her
on many subjects, but on religious matters he was
most often silent, although once he said, following
some comment of hers, "Strange as it may seem,
here on the earth there are numbers of religious
groups with different philosophies, many of which
think that they alone are God's true disciples. But
the center of them all is Jesus Christ our Lord
and Savior, and he, with his Almighty grace, will
<span id="page-105"></span>
have us all gathered home to himself when that
great harvest day comes." What could she say
to that? Elder Hansen would have known the
answer right away!

When Else asked Mads what he really thought
of her admirer he replied, "Ja, he's good enough
for some girls but not good enough for you." A
typical brother-answer, but she knew Mads liked
him. Mor plied her with questions about him
night and day; it was easy to see which way the
wind blew with her. Her dear sisters, Karen and
Stine, not fortunate enough yet to have suitors
of their own, volunteered eagerly to do sewing
for her brides-chest; while twelve year old Marie,
happy and gay, was always hanging on Rudolph in
her flighty way, whenever the chance came,
showing off. Far said little about him in her
presence, but looked on with seeming approval,
though she knew the time would surely come when
he would feel obliged to speak to her sweetheart
and ask him of his intentions with his second
daughter. Else began to spend more and more
time in Rudolph's company and regard his opinions
more highly also; but just how, when or where she
first fell in love with him only she herself could
divulge.

Customs have differed in various lands and
the marriage custom is no exception. In Denmark,
an engagement was considered fully as binding as
a wedding. A hopeful couple's intentions were
supposed to be announced by the Priest from the
church pulpit for three successive Sundays, and
each of the parties involved were expected to be
present on all three occasions. Then, to bind the
engagement bargain, the groom-to-be would give
the bride-to-be a gold band for her finger, at
which time it was considered that henceforth the
maid belonged to him and they could begin living
together if they so chose -- and most chose. The
wedding itself, whether it followed soon or later,
as a matter of choice or convenience, was more
or less a formality after that, with a merry
festival thrown in of course.

Before the late autumn had waned, Else and
her sweetheart were betrothed, but whether she
<span id="page-106"></span>
consented to the Parish Priest having a part in it
we have strong doubts. However, be that as it
may, their plans were made. Rudolph would
begin raising a cottage for her, while she returned
to Bested to teach young children reading, writing
and Bible stories, for the Bible was used as a text
then in many Danish schools. Come spring again
she would return home to prepare for her wedding,
but she wished to have a try at teaching for which
she had prepared so diligently. She hoped to be
a good teacher -- and after that, a good wife. But
there was another hope which she dared not voice
but for which she prayed silently with all her heart,
night and day. Oh that her people and her love might
be guided to a knowledge of the true and everlasting
gospel; this was the import of her prayers. She
knew this was a large request -- but miracles were
happening in Denmark every day, and Else believed
in miracles.

The families on both sides were well pleased
with the engagement, but Mette herself was overjoyed 
and proud at the prospects of getting so fine
a son-in-law -- Ja, and from the nobility too, way
back! She planned a bright wedding festival for
spring; it would be her first opportunity. With
difficulty she turned her thoughts to other, more
mundane, things. Helping Else get prepared and
off for teaching took attention, as did sewing and
fixing for Stine who would leave home for the first
time to enroll in Thisted City Folk High School.
Next year she would take her apprenticeship in a
lace making establishment, for that was what she
desired. Karen was still working in the embroidery
shop, and now Marie put up a fuss to go to work
also. She wanted no more of school for she
planned to be a housemaid or a cook, and Mor
could teach her that. Most Danish peasant girls
started working at twelve, she said, to help out.
It took some doing to get her back to the schoolhouse, 
but Mette was set on "deres b&oslash;rn" getting
as much education as possible, Far was doing
well now with his rents and his daughters needn't
go to find employment so young. Besides the farm
and cottage, he owned an extra building or two in
town, did "householder" Anders, Then Christen
had come back from the war and he was gloomy,
<span id="page-107"></span>
quickly upset, and he coughed a lot; anyone could
see he was not quite well, inside or out. Work
was scarce and wages low and he had not yet
established himself. Besides, he was a bachelor
still and this worried Mette considerably. He
was restless and gone from there a lot, days at
a time, and none of them knew for what. It might
be wise if he, and all of them together, were to
attend the revival soon to be held at the church
there in N&oslash;rhaa, since the great Lutheran Bishop,
N.F.S. Grundtvig himself, would be present.
The Bishop was traveling all about the kingdom,
lecturing at churches and high schools, trying to
rally the Danish people from the discouragement,
bitterness and lethargy caused by the war and the
loss of so much of their land; for now they were
the smallest in Europe.

* * * * *

Else lived again at the Folk High School,
where she took a few classes and listened to
lectures by old men, as she could; but her daytime 
hours were mostly spent in teaching at
another school in the city. She had freedom to go
and come, for which she was thankful, as it gave
her opportunities to attend meetings without unpleasant 
explanations. The Elders had returned to
Bested too, following disruptions, and cottage
meetings had been resumed there. It was not yet
considered safe again to hold public meetings in
Jutland, because of a new flare-up of mobbings
and violence, kindled by the aftermath and frustrations 
of a lost war. Danish youths, many with
nothing much to do but roam the streets at nights,
seemed to make a serious sport of persecuting
and heckling the Saints. The police now mostly
ignored this situation, or blinked at it, but the
Danish Priests were still very much in on the
"urging" of it, for they saw their congregations
dwindling because of this new religion, which
thousands of Danes all over the kingdom had joined
during the past fourteen years.

Elder Lars Hansen was back again, with a
new companion. Else had such confidence in him
for he had taught her the gospel first of all. No 
Danish Priest had ever touched her soul as he had,
<span id="page-108"></span>
not even the great Grundtvig. She had been a most 
ardent investigator before, but now she had come
to believe in the Restored Church with all her being.
The Elders had told her she was fully ready to be
baptised and had urged her to do so, yet she hesitated; 
there was something of which she must be
assured first. Was it not possible, if she waited
awhile, that she and her loved ones might be all
"d&oslash;bt" in together? The Elders' advice to her had
been, -- "Ja, but don't wait too long; the devil
himself has many tricks for the wavering!" But
they encouraged her to continue to be faithful and
prayerful, but in the meantime to use all her
powers to bring her people to an understanding of
the truth, Perhaps she herself was to be God's
instrument in this, if it was his will that they be
led to the light.

Else considered their words, but she had
little faith in herself where her loved ones were
concerned. Hers was not what one could call a
religious family. True, they spoke of God often
and most freely, as did many Danes; but their
hearts seemed somewhat turned from him and set
on other things. It was as if they but parroted the
Priest, though they seldom attended his masses,
except when necessity took them there, and on
Holy Days of Yule, for excitement. But Rudolph
now -- she had strange and far-off feelings about
him, and stranger dreams; precious little she knew
about her lover after all. Her letters home were
many and full of affection, as well as of all the
carefully worded new religious ideas she dared
to putin them. The answers back, however, were
far from satisfying; mayhaps they thought her just
a ranting child. Rudolph wrote only of love and
his impatience for their marriage, and of course
about the cottage he was building. Her family too
avoided any religious discussions, but wrote of
home things and the local gossip, although they
were as friendly as always and usually ended
every letter with, "A thousand loving greetings
from us all!" Else felt she was getting no place
with them about the things nearest her heart -- no
place at all.

Yuletide came in such a hurry that year -- long
<span id="page-109"></span>
before she was ready for it. There was
plenty of snow, though not too much cold, so that
Rudolph could come for her in his sleigh, with
bells a-jingling, to bring her home. Her heart
gave a leap to be near him, but there was a
feeling of restraint also. It was like black and
white. It was the same when she came to the
cottage too; she wanted to be gay, yet she was
sad. It was all so confusing, for her emotions
kept fighting themselves back and forth the 
live-long time. She noted no change in the others.
This should have been her brightest Yule. Her
betrothed was most often there, attentive and
possessive, and she liked it -- yet she liked it
not. Mette had gone to such great pains with the
cooking. The Yule gifts for her brides-chest
were elegant and many: - newly made quilts,
freshly downed pillows, embroidered cases,
sheets and underthings - the chest was now
she had to sit on it to shut it.

Strangely, the talk then was much about religion 
and of how the famous Grundtvig had said
this-and-that and such-and-such. Had Else heard
him? Yes she had, several times. Well? She
smiled and passed it off; had she told them her
thoughts they'd have scarce agreed. Every 
discussion eventually got back to "those Mormons!"
They talked of recent mobbings and Far said,
"'Tis not good to run with mobs - let the devil
take care of his own." Christen did not agree: - "The 
devil could do with a little help there", he
said. He was most vicious in his attack on the
"Saints" as he denounced them in no uncertain
terms, Poor fellow, thought Else, the war had
left him mixed up indeed. Then Mads, always
trying to make peace, said it was people's right
to worship as they pleased, under the new constitution; 
then his eyes twinkled, "But perhaps these
Mormons have some good in them after all!" My
what a howl went up as everybody got into the
discussing. Else almost swallowed her tongue
holding back the words which were fighting to
come out of her. As the heated tirade against
the "Saints" ran on it took turns that she dared
not try to check, though her cheeks burned with
indignation as she listened, eyes cast down.
<span id="page-110"></span>
There was no use. She feit the tower of words she
had built up so high and long to say, crumble and
fall about her in a useless heap - and her great
hope toppled with it! So she sat silent, as if
condemned, but forced a smile to cover up her
heartbreak. It was the Great Almighty himself
then who would have to produce the miracle with
them, if miracle there was to be, for Else knew
now full well that she herself could not.

* * * * *

Life moved along into the new year and the
weather held good, for a time. Letters went back
and forth as before, but the days and miles seemed
farther apart for Else K. She wrote no more to
her loved ones of religion however, but of school
and family affairs inthe main. She asked about
the house Rudolph was building -- were the rafters
raised yet? She spoke of everyday things, but
rarely did she mention her coming wedding. From
Mor she inquired of Far, the girls, Mads, and had
Christen found himself work yet - or perhaps a
wife? How were all their kinsfolk - Tante Inger,
Onkel Peter and the cousins, and those north in
Jannerup and Hundborg, and the rest? "Ja, Ja"
Mor had replied; everyone was well and mostly
happy and she herself was busy, busy! Her sister
Dorthe and husband Anders Simonsen and family,
and her brother Jens Hvid of Svindborg, had all
sent greetings and said to tell her "hello"; they
were all coming sure for the wedding. Even
Bedstemoder Karen's sister, great aunt Maren of
Hundborg, hoped she lived till then, though she
was feeble. "And receive the most loving greetings
from all of us here at home" she had ended, Else
supposed she had told everyone, had Mette, but
she herself had shut her mind on her wedding; she
had far more pressing things to use it for.

Those were weeks of anxiety and indecision
then; never had she felt so lost and alone. People
all around, chattering here and there, seemed so
free from care -- was she then the only distressed
one? Her mind was like a great swing of good and
evil going back and forth so fast it almost took her
breath away. Else thought sometimes that it was
with her as it was with the old Danish saying, -- "The
<span id="page-111"></span>
good things I intend to do I do not, but the
evil I didn't intend to do, I do." [Romans 7:19] She 
wanted to do the right thing, but how was one to know always?
One thing she did know for sure -- she wanted to
be baptised more than anything! But what of her
family? It would be impossible for her to face 
them, after. She couldn't simply walk out of their
lives and never come back, could she? Then she
recalled the maid at the school -- she had almost
forgotten those at the High School. What would
they do? She had heard that men lost their jobs
and that their children were mistreated at school
because of joining the Mormons. (Perhaps it was
she herself she was thinking of more than her
family, as girls her age were apt to do.) She
remembered some lines she had learned from
Shakespeare's "Hamlet Prince of Denmark": -- "There 
is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough
hew them though we may." What were her ends
to be - her destiny? The Elders had said so many
threw away their destinies for lack of courage.
"Ja, we are all weak, but we can be stronga!"
She heard herself saying those words, as she had
said them to her mother, months ago. So her
thinking and her days and nights worried on,
tormenting her until she felt at times that she
could hardly hold on to their endings.

Then it was announced by the brethren that a
special baptismal service was to be held the latter
part of the month and President S&oslash;ren Jensen of
the Aalborg District was to visit Bested for that
occasion. Several investigators from there and
the surrounding villages were ready to be baptised,
and of course "the Lord is depending on Sister
Else to be ready too." Sometimes God's ways
are so mysterious it is hard for one to understand
them; but again sometimes they are so plain to
those who are sincerely seeking. At that moment
all Else Katherine's old, accumulated worries
flew away, for a time, and she was at peace.
"Why of course" - if the messengers of the Lord
said he was depending on her she would certainly
be baptised! No doubt she felt then somewhat as
Nephi, that great character from the Book of
Mormon, had felt when he said, "I will go and do
the things which the Lord has commanded, for I
<span id="page-112"></span>
know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto
the children of men save he shall prepare a way
for them that they may accomplish the thing which
he commandeth them."

Public meetings then in Denmark were protected, 
under the constitution--if they were
orderly. The authorities were supposed to be
notified a week in advance if any were planned.
So the Elders went to the police in Bested, telling
them they had engaged a hall for the evening of
January 25th, where they would hold a meeting
for members, investigators and any of the interested 
public who cared to attend, with President
S&oslash;ren Jensen as the speaker. The baptismal
service would be held earlier that day, but they
did not mention that detail to the authorities. They
located a sheltered bend in a lazy river meandering 
northwest through the edge of the city, then
turning in a big loop, picking its way southwest
again towards &Oslash;rum Sound, into which it finally
emptied. The weather was cold and streams were
frozen over, but Jutlandic winters were ever like
this; one could not always choose summer to be
baptised.

Just before dusk crept down and closed the
gates of day, the late afternoon of Wednesday
January 25th, 1865, the ice was broken through
in the place they had decided on and the baptisms
began, followed by the confirmations. There were
only a few present but Else Kathrine Andersen was
among them, It is strange how warm cold can
seem sometimes, especially when one is heated
from within by the spirit, Else, clothed all in
white, as were the others, hardly shivered at all
in the icy water as Elder Lars Hansen "d&oslash;bte" her,
or right after that either as Elder S&oslash;ren Jensen
confirmed the baptism assisted by Elder Hansen
and conferred on her the Holy Ghost. Then it was
over for her and she knew she would never be alone
again, if she kept faithful. She was a Latter-day
Saint - a Mormon - and she felt wonderful--so full
of peace and contentment! The wet ones changed
into dry clothes behind the quilts others held up,
brought for that purpose, and then bundled in
heavy coats, boots, warm shawls for the women
<span id="page-113"></span>
and caps for the men, they all walked together a
mile or so through snowy lanes to the meeting
hall, close to the outskirts of the city. Others
were present there when they arrived, but they
were few in numbers and mostly women.

They sang a hymn and someone opened with
prayer and then, following the Sacrament, names
of the newly baptised members were announced
and each stood up. Elder Hansen was in charge
and introduced the speaker, Elder S&oslash;ren Jensen,
President of the Aalborg District, "an obedient
and faithful servant of the Lord and a great
missionary" he called him. Elder Jensen smiled,
stood up and, opening his Book of Mormon, started
reading from Alma 5:37-40: 'O ye workers of
iniquity: Ye that are puffed up in the vain things
of the world" (he skipped around some) -- "if ye
are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what 
fold are ye? Behold I say unto you, that the devil
is your shepherd, and ye of his fold; and now, who
can deny this?" -- "For I say unto you that whatsoever 
is good cometh from God, and whatsoever
is evil cometh from the devil."

Then, of a sudden, there was such commotion and 
clamoring outside it was as if the war had
broken loose again -- shouting, swearing, and
pounding of things; nothing could be heard above
the din of it! Elder Jensen held up his hand to
stay the congregation, who would have jumped
from their seats. A rock came crashing through
a window, then another. The door at the back of
the worshipers was flung open and lights from
torches leaped at the ceiling behind. Were they
to be baptised in fire now? thought Else. Now
they were frozen to their seats with fright.
Stones began to fly, someone pounded as if to
knock the hall to pieces, and all the time the
yelling and cursing went on! Else thought
suddenly of the young male students at the school
and their threats she had heard so recently; could
they have followed her? She clutched her shawl
more closely about her face; -- dared she look
behind? Windows were being smashed again and
it sounded as if everything loose back there was
being hacked up and flung out into the gutter. The
<span id="page-114"></span>
devil himself was loose in Bested that night! There
was deep silence for a tenth of a minute; terrible,
stiffening silence. Then a voice close in back of
Else thundered out a horrible oath. She knew that
voice! Quickly she turned -- and gazed straight
into the face of Christen! She cried out his name,
then weeping came on her. It had all happened so
fast. At the cry of her voice, the havocking
mobbers hesitated, then turned and rushed from
the hall as suddenly as they had come, Christen in
the lead, and dissolved into the night, taking their
torches with them; while Elder Jensen still stood
there at the speakers' table, like a Danish statue,
his hand raised as if in benediction. Who could
have dreamed that a miracle would happen that
night?

* * * * *

In the last part of January, a terrifically
hard winter had set in, with snowstorms and frigid
temperatures in all the Scandinavian countries,
"freezing the Baltic and the Belts, breaking off all
steamboat communications, as well as stopping the
railroad trains for several days. This made the
sending of mails and traveling not only inconvenient
but very irregular, on account of the great depths
of the ice and snow." In Thisted Amt, where there
were no trains then, public coaches were delayed
or stopped entirely for a period; children were
kept home from school; church meetings were 
discontinued temporarily; farmers were hard pressed
for the safety of their livestock; and all people who
could manage it stayed indoors till the worst subsided. 
It was most unusual, even for Denmark;
hardly anyone had ever remembered so bitter a
winter.

As the stagecoach, bound for N&oslash;rhaa, jolted
along the snow-clogged road at the pace of a snail,
Else reviewed the events of the past two weeks,
Her busy mind kept throwing itself back to unpleasant 
happenings, those she cared least to recall: -- that
dreadful night of January 25th; the uproar at
the High School a few days later; her dismissal
from her teaching position, when the "Lensman"
had shouted at her some vile accusation, which
burned her cheeks even now as she remembered it;
<span id="page-115"></span>
the trudging through the piles of wet snow with her
little identification book which needed to be stamped
against her leaving, and the impudent questions of
the police at the time; her hurried packing right
after, and the utter loneliness she had felt at
having all her bridges burned around her in Bested.

There was no one else in the north-going
coach for her to speak to, except the old coachman, 
who was busy with his pipe and his own
thinking, as well as with the oft-stumbling horses
ahead. Else pulled her coat and shawl more
snugly to her in the drafty vehicle, settled the
robes closer around her legs and placed her
booted feet more firmly on the heated stones
again. Nothing could keep out the chill of this
Jutlandic winter, she thought, and surely only
desperate people like herself would be traveling
in it. Though exhausted, she couldn't sleep, for
the choppy movement of the coach kept throwing
her back and forth; and besides, her feelings were
all mixed up inside her. She feared the worst at
N&slash;rhaa, for she had received no letters from
there since her baptism, even from Rudolph;
though she had thought she would faint with expectation, 
What had Christen told them, if anything?

Else was going home now to ease her mind,
one way or another -- but supposing she were
unwelcome there? Her lips quivered at the
thought. She had given up her hopes of the family
joining the Restored Church, there was too much
bitterness in them against it. Neither would
Rudolph join, she felt now, for he was narrow-minded 
like the rest; nor did she suppose he would
hold her to their wedding bargain, once he knew,
for he was proud too, like her mother. She was
surprised at being able to banish him from her
future so lightly, but marriage now held little
charm for her, especially with a non-member.
At first she had considered emigrating, if worst
came at home, but this took lots of money, she
had heard, and she had little enough, having been
unable to collect the last due her at the school
because of leaving her position "on such short
notice and for such bad reason", the authorities
there had said. How quickly she had grown from
<span id="page-116"></span>
girlhood to womanhood in the past few months.

Else ate her cold lunch as she rode along,
and turned her mind back again to Bested and her
last few days there. In her anxiety at losing her
position and all, she had sought out Elder Hansen
for comfort and advice. He had taken her to the
humble cottage of some friendly converts, where
she had found lodging, till she knew what next to
do. They had talked then of her problems, for
she had needed to talk to someone with sympathy
and understanding, more than anything. She had
spoken of her uncertainty of things at home, her
present unhappiness with her marriage bargain,
and even of emigration - but her lack of money for
it. She wanted to do the right and wisest thing, she
had stated, but above all she wished to do the things
her Heavenly Father desired of her, no matter how
difficult or sad, though the thoughts of grieving her
family and being forced to separate from them in
harshness, if so 'twas proved, would be hard
indeed for her to bear. Other employment she
must have, and soon; she was willing to work at
anything, she confessed, but where in this terrible
weather would one go to find something?

The good and kind Elder had listened patiently
all the while, as she had talked herself through in a
constant flow of words interspersed with tears; then
had drawn something from his pocket and shown it
to her. She herself had received no letters lately,
but Elder Hansen had; and one in particular in
which he thought she might be interested. It was
from an old friend of his whom he hadn't seen since
the war, Elder Lars Christian Myrup. He and his
missionary companion were then laboring in the
most southern part of Thisted Amt, at the village
of Kobber&oslash;, near the water. Here they were-
teaching a fine family of investigators, a 
well-to-do farmer and his sickly wife, together with six
children, three of them very young daughters who
were in much need of a governess, their last one
having left in haste when they let the Mormon
missionaries into their home. The Elder said he
had a great desire to help those good people find
someone for their little girls, particularly since
he found himself in the awkward position of being
<span id="page-117"></span>
the "mischief-maker", having been one of the
Mormons they let in, It would be the greatest
and most friendly favor, he had written, should
Elder Hansen find someone responsible in his
area who could qualify. An intelligent, personable, 
capable Mormon sister would be most desirable, 
since this would not only solve his immediate
problem but might also be the means of hastening
the baptisms of these family members. He was
especially set on these baptisms, Elder Myrup had
confided, since he had his eyes on the eldest daughter. 
Then he added a P.S. -- "The farmer can
afford to pay well but the applicant must be able
to furnish proper references, of course. 
"Of course!" -- Else remembered how her
hopes had tumbled at this last, but up until then
she had been listening with mounting eagerness
to the letter recital. She had thought, Who now
would give "proper" references to a runaway
Mormon convert? Most of her few pleasant
memories lately had been thus sprinkled with
bitterness, like black pepper. Elder Hansen had
spoken then, as if in answer to her thinking, -- "I
will vouch for you myself, Sister Andersen, if
you desire the position; and I promise you, in full
faith, that you shall obtain it, if this be so!" Then,
since she was silent, considering, he continued,
"Who can say but that if you are frugal and diligent 
you may be able to emigrate in the spring?
Elder Jensen, myself and others of my family
from Jutland, are leaving for Zion in early May
on a ship the church has secured. There is much
chance of employment in the valley of the mountains 
and I have friends there who would help you."
All of a sudden she had blurted out, before she
could stop the words, -- "Are you a bachelor
then?" And Elder Hansen had smiled and answered,
"Nej - I have a sweet wife and new-born son in
Aalborg. I haven't seen the wee one yet but they
say he favors me." After a pause, and rather
raspy then, as if her throat were dry, she had
gotten out the words, -- "I will take the position - and
be most thankful for it - but first I must go
home to N&oslash;rhaa and bid goodbye." Elder Hansen
himself had bid goodbye then, after having promised
to write his friend Lars in Kobber&oslash; and make all
<span id="page-118"></span>
arrangements for the position for her, and let her
have word of it in N&oslash;rhaa as soon as a letter came
back. He had taken the address of her parents to
reassure her, Else herself had stayed on a few
more days at the humble cottage and then boarded
the first available stagecoach going north. She
remembered again, as the horses tugged and
strained at the coach in the deep snow under the
fitful prodding of the coachman's whip, the lines
she loved from "Hamlet", -- "There is a divinity
that shapes our ends, rough hew them though we
may." What will be will be, she thought. She had
done the best she knew - what came now was up to
heaven. But it would be so good to be home again.

It was past dark when they arrived at her
parents' cottage. There was no one standing at
the door to greet her for she was not expected.
The coachman's sharp commands to the flagging
animals, the flash of swinging lanterns, and the
grinding of coach wheels to a stop, however,
brought a pull-back of a curtain at the front window
and then a loud calling inside -- "Far, Mor, it is
Else!" Then the door was flung wide and Karen
was there on the stoop in one and the same breath
nearly. At the same moment giggling Marie flew
out from the kitchen, and there were kisses all
around as her sisters helped her carry in her
valises and boxes. Her father stood up smiling
from his chair, putting his pipe away, reaching
out as she ran to him and almost smothered him
in her embrace. "Else, my Else", he almost
sang it; "to think you should have come back to us
on your eighteenth festival!" She had forgotten her
own birthday. "February 9th, eighteen years ago,"
Far continued; "how well I remember - it was
almost such a night as this when you first came
to us. We were expecting someone then - a boy
I had hoped", and he winked at her in the old way.
Then all was well here afterall, Else thought; but
where was her mother? She went then and stooped
to plant a kiss on the pale cheek of the ailing Stine,
for she was sitting by the fire, propped up in a big
chair, smelling of mustard plasters and other
remedies for her old complaint. She'd been brought
from the school at Thisted, she said, for the damp
and cold had set her breathing queezily again. Else
<span id="page-119"></span>
seated herself by the fire then and her father
insisted on pulling off her boots and shoes and
chaffing her feet, as he used to when she was a
little girl -- but there was still no sign of Mor.
Karen poured a cup of coffee and brought it
steaming to her where she sat, and just then
Mads stomped in from outside, clearing his boots
and shaking his great coat and, in his surprise,
would have taken her in a bear-hug, coffee and all,
had she not saved herself. Christen was the only
one absent now, they said. Else was glad for that,
but kept worrying about her mother, for it was so
unlike Mette to stay out of things. She wanted to
ask about her but something held her tongue; perhaps 
she feared to shatter the sweet contentment
of those moments.

Then they put her to the table with Danish
soup and dumplings, ladled out piping hot from the
kettle; the rest had eaten, they said. Else thought
she would founder -- no one could make soup and
dumplings like her mother! Having thought of her
again she needs must ask then, "Is Mor ill?"
Karen leaned to her quickly and whispered, --
"She has been so distraught about you since she
heard, but she will see now that it isn't true and
feel well again." So, thought Else, her premonitions 
were not unfounded. Then her father cleared
his throat and added quietly, "There have been
some rather ugly rumors here about you, daughter,
and Mor has taken them rather badly. She is a
proud woman, as you are aware, and has had many
high hopes for you. Go in to your mother dear and
tell her all is right with you." "But of what am I
accused then?" Else asked, sparring for time and
words in which to tell them the worst, though she
had rehearsed this moment and the words a hundred
times over in her mind. She longed to be spared
the ordeal till morning at least, for she was so
weary. But Mads said, looking straight at her,
"Christen says you meet and pray with Mormons,
for he has seen you at it! I fear he has said the
same all over N&oslash;rhaa and elsewhere, by now."
Then Rudolph knew also, she thought quickly; but
yet she hesitated. Still, what had she hoped to
face here afterall but this? At last she said,
rising, "I will go in and speak to Mor." But of a
<span id="page-120"></span>
sudden Mette stood in the doorway of her bedchamber, 
disheveled, with eyes red from weeping.
"I will save you the bother," she said in as cold a
voice as Else had ever had from her. "Tell us,"
she half commanded, "we are all here but Christen;
tell us - Can you deny these things that have brought
us all down to disgrace in our homeland?"

There was no other way out then for Else, so
she turned and faced her family squarely, almost
as if at bay, expecting the worst, and told them in
as gentle a manner as she could: -- "Ja, Christen
did not lie; all he said is true - and more. I am a
Mormon now. I was baptized the very day of the
night he saw me, I have been dismissed from my
position at the school too, because of it, so have
come home to you. Is there else you would have
me go in this weather? Is there anything wicked
in believing a better way or living a better life?"
Her voice quivered to a halt then; she had been surprised 
at her own courage but more still that they
all stayed to listen, even Mette; although she
started speaking again the minute Else had ceased.
"What of Rudolph then - have you no feelings for
his pride? Do you expect to hold him to his wedding
bargain?" Else sensed a faint flicker of hope in her
mother's voice at that last question, but answered,
"Nej -- I could not put him to such great test of his
love. Though I still regard him fondly as ever, I
could never marry a non-Mormon now; so I shall
pray him to free me from the bargain." Then she
took the gold band Rudolph had given her from her
finger and laid it gently on the table by her, asking
Mads if he would take it to him and beg him to
come there to the cottage that she might ask his
forgiveness.

At this Mette flung herself back into her bedchamber 
and onto her pillow, with noisy weeping
and wailing. Then Stine was seized with such a
coughing and wheezing spell that both Karen and
Else rushed to her and moved her arms up and
down and pounded lightly on her back, until she
was relieved; and then Karen helped her to her
room to bed. Marie would have stayed there with
her ears wide, had not Far sent her to her bed
also. Without a word, Mads had picked up the
<span id="page-121"></span>
ring and readied himself for outdoors again,
looking less than happy about it though. Soon only
Else and Anders were left standing there by the
fire and Else turned and threw her arms about her
father, sobbing, "Far, I love you!" But Anders
put her gently off and sank into a chair, head in
hands. She hurried then and knelt down by him,
for she still had much to say; yet when he turned
his face to her at last, the words stuck in her
mouth at the sight of his unhappiness; and it was
he who spoke first then, but it seemed painful for
him for his voice shook with emotion, "Else",
he said, "Your whole life we have tried to do
nothing but good for you. I remember when you
were a tot, how you rode on my shoulder and
hung on my hair till it hurt, but the pulling-hurt
was sheer joy because I loved you so much! Ever
since then you have been hanging onto my heart-strings 
and pulling at them, as have all the rest
of my offspring, but your clasp has seemed
firmest and strongest, somehow. Now this
terrible thing has come on us and it seems as if
those strings must snap in two. Why didn't someone 
warn us that our child was in danger?" He
paused for a moment, then went on: "True, you
are a woman now, but to your mother and me you
are still just a child grown dearer. Can't you
give up this foolish nonsense daughter and be
one with us again?"

Then Else considered thoughtfully for awhile
and at last spoke, -- "Would you have me deny the
great truths the Lord himself has planted in my
heart? Would you have me throw away a glorious
salvation?" He cut her off sharply then -- "Salvation, 
salvation" he almost shouted. "All those
rantings and goings-on about salvation. I should
have had my wits about, last summer, before it
was too late! Do you think the 'All Father' is
pleased that you have humiliated us before our
townsmen, friends, kinsfolk and the very Priest
himself? Is he pleased that you should put your
mother to her sickbed with grief? Why would so
great a one give us such a wonderful daughter and
then take her away thus? Nej, nej, Else; 'tis the
very devil himself has done this to you - and to
us! They are of the devil, those Mormons, and
<span id="page-122"></span>
it is better that you were dead than be one of them,
No other Mormon shall ever set foot in this cottage,
I vow it!" Karen, who had returned to her sewing
place meantime, could no longer pretend not to be
listening, so quietly plunging her needle in and out,
and spoke to her wrought-up father, -- "You can't
mean what you are saying, Far dear; surely all is
not so bad and Else will come to her senses by and
by." Then she turned to her sister in kindness, -- "You 
may sleep with me in my bed as you used to."

Silence grew heavy in the room as all three
sat where they were for a time. Then Anders
blew his nose furiously, stood up, put more wood
on the waning fire, and went into his bedchamber
without another word or back glance. Karen too
got up, saying she would warm the bed first, and
taking Else's night valise from the corner went into
her bedroom. Else still sat there on the floor,
utterly dejected, hoping Mads would come soon.
It was too late now to expect Rudolph. Likely he
would come tomorrow. She doubted that she could
sleep for she was sure her thoughts would never
lie down and be quiet after all that had been said
to her, though there was a numbness about her as
if she herself were past thinking and feeling.
Finally Mads returned and came and sat in the
chair by her. He was gentler than she had expected
and she broke down and cried some. He patted her
arm as it lay on the chair's arm, and told her the
outcome of his errand. "Ja, just a liquid promise 
that ran off so quickly", Rudolph had said as he
took the ring back gladly enough, "A bargain I am
well pleased to be rid of, with one who prefers
'Mormon Elders' to my company. Else need not
worry about forgiveness or more about me either,
as I'll be off in the next coach for K&oslash;benhavn
again. The Danish girls are prettier there!" This
flippancy in Else's former suitor had put her
brother on the defense in her behalf, although they
both knew the unkind words spoken were only slapbacks f
or hurt feelings or injured pride - who could tell which?

Then Else told Mads how their father had
spoken to her, and wept again in the process. She
said she could not bear to stay there much longer
in the face of it and Mor's unhappiness too. She
<span id="page-123"></span>
would only wait now until she had a letter from the
Mormon Elder in Bested, assuring her of her new
position. If that didn't arrive -- well, she just
couldn't bear to think of what then would become
ofher. "Nej," she answered at his questioning,
she could never give up the new church and its
teachings, even if it meant giving up her beloved
family, which she now feared might be required
of her. She prayed for them all constantly, she
told him, that they also might be converted to the
truth and come to the same understanding that had
brought her such joy and hope for the future. Go
from N&oslash;rhaa she must though, one way or another.
She had faith that the Heavenly Father would direct
her in the path she should take. Mads shied from
the religious side of things but told Else that if
she needed money he had some saved from his war
pay which she was most welcome to. She shed a
few more tears at his thoughtfulness. Then he
told her something he had never spoken of before
at home; how he had fought side by side with a
Mormon Elder in the war and was beholden to
him for saving his life at Dybboel Hill, "All on
our side were brothers in that war," he said, and 
Else answered, "All are brothers and sisters 
every day, everywhere, for are we not all God's
children?" So they sat there softly talking, as
friendly as ever they had been. Not until the
sound of sobbing had long been overcome by
snoring in their parents' bedchamber had they
said goodnight and retired.

On the surface the following few days and
night passed somewhat as usual in the cottage,
with things never again getting completely out
of hand as they had that first night of Else's
homecoming. Here was a family of no ordinary
peasant upbringing and its members generally
knew how to behave and did it, all except Christen
that is. Else was treated with courtesy, for the
most part, and her needs were well taken care of.
But there was an underlying strain between Else
and her parents, neither of them caring nor daring
to speak more to her of what was between them,
or she to them, lest the tension explode again into
bitterness as before. Mette had ceased her weeping, 
in the main, but ignored or avoided her
<span id="page-124"></span>
daughter; engaging herself instead with sundry
things in her bedchamber when she was not cooking 
some of the things Else relished most, in the
kitchen, as if to remind her what she would be
missing once she left there again. If the two did 
meet, at meals and the like, the older woman was
silent with high head and evasive eyes; though truly
there was a certain dignity in the way she put it
over. Only once in those days did she forget herself 
and speak impulsively before she could check
it. "Any natural mother would try to keep her
child from walking into a fire" she said, as if in
self defense, And Else thought, "So, it is burning
she fears for me now!" But once started her
mother had gone on passionately: "Do you realize
what you have done to yourself? Anyone who leaves
the State Church is not able to marry legally or
have their children christened or their dead buried.
Have you thought of that? Do you realize what you
have done to us besides?" As she stopped for
breath, Else put in sincerely, -- "Forgive me
Mor; I love you dearly, in spite of our differences
and would give anything to be able to heal your
sorrow." Instead of offering the embrace Else
ached for then, her mother had flung herself into
her bedchamber again and thrown back over her
shoulder the words, "You should have thought of
that when you gave your family up to run with
Mormons!" Nothing short of her leaving would
satisfy Mor now, Else thought; then an idea had
filtered through her unhappy mind:--It was not her
mother's heart but her pride that was shattered;
not only her plans but her love too, that had been
forced aside. How her mother seemed to have
changed towards her.

Change had come over her father too. A
Danishman is king in his own household, and so it
had always been with Anders, in spite of a "husfru"
like Mette. His own children adored him, for he
had been a splendid father. Else had never known
him to rule with anything but love and gentleness
before. This man who mostly now sat so glum and
brooding, when not busy outdoors with his livestock,
was a stranger to her. There was no merry
twinkle in his eye, no sharpness of wit and humor,
no enthusiasm for her accomplishments, no 
fond<span id="page-125"></span> embraces. Yet 
he had not been unkind to her
since that first night nor had he spoken ought of
scorn or blame, or avoided her. But their infrequent 
conversations now were small talk, unimportant, 
impersonal; for in those days after her
eighteenth birthday, Far never again spoke to her
of deep-down things he felt sincerely or the matters
she longed so desperately to hear 
about--understanding--forgiveness--love! She sensed 
behind the words that remained unsaid, the little things
he might have said and didn't, the firm unbending
of his will--like a stone. Still she herself felt
little change in her love and respect for Far, or
Mor either; it was deep hurt she felt.

The frost held on outside, and inside the
cottage as well, as far as Else and her parents
were concerned at least. But there were some
pleasant hours for her, mixed in with the gloom,
whenever the undercurrent of unhappiness was
lulled awhile in the company of Mads and her
sisters. There seemed little change in their
friendship for her, although the girls were more
restrained. Mads was like an anchor in a storm
and she clung to the security of his concern for
her and cherished each few moments they had been
able to be alone together. Karen had helped her
clean and mend her clothes and select the ones
most useful to her should she go to be a governess.
Else wondered if it were less for the pleasure of
being of service or more for the chance of 
reindoctrinating her into her former faith, that she
helped; for Karen was by far the most devout
Lutheran of them all. Especially when they were
together in bed at nights would she say things,
such as, -- "Just believe and live as you choose
Else, but be a Lutheran, not a Mormon." It was
as simple as that to the sweet Karen, for she
seemed unable to grasp the difference between
faiths. Stine now, like Mads, had been as loving
as ever. Else had spent much of her time talking
to this ailing sister and tending to her. "You have
more of a way of making me comfortable and less
ill than the others have," Stine had said, when she
rubbed her; "Such wonderful hands to ease pain!"
Marie was still home all day for it was yet too
cold and snowy for school. She had hung on Else
<span id="page-126"></span>
a lot and seemed to think she was something to be
viewed with wide eyes now, "Are you really truly
a Mormon?" This question her thirteen year old
sister had asked many times over in those seven
days; for now a week had passed since Else came
home.

Else had prayed constantly and fervently in
her heart that the letter would come from Bested
soon, bringing her relief from the fix she was in.
She could not bear to stay on and grieve her parents 
longer, nor could she go without a place to go. Day
after day she had watched for the mailcoach in vain.
None had come to the cottage, whether on errands
or to call or visit, although word must have gotten
around that she was home. Even Christen hadn't
come, and for this she thanked heaven. It couldn't
all be blamed on the weather. Else couldn't help
but suspect somehow, in the face of it all, that
besides Christen, the neighbors, her kinsfolk,
and even her dearest friends and girlhood companions, 
were speaking evil of her now, It was
strange too, but she imagined that the likenesses
of her very ancestors, in their old frames on the
walls, were looking down on her sternly. In other
days, long gone by, she was sure they had smiled
when she chanced to look up at them. Yes, Else
was in a fix all right and only heaven knew the end
of it.

But on the eighth day the horn of the mailcoach 
came blowing at the cottage door. Marie
ran out quickly and came back bearing a letter
for Else. It was from Elder Hansen in Bested
and held wonderful news. The well-to-do farmer
in Kobber&oslash;, Christen Christensen by name (the
same as their half brother's) had sent the price of
her coach fare, plus a request that the young lady
come at the earliest moment, since they were in
much need of her there. Then it must needs be
that Else should ascertain the leaving time of the
very next stagecoach and make arrangements to
travel south on it, as well as go to the police in
N&oslash;rhaa for the signing of her little book. Mads
accompanied her, lest she come to some harm
in the town through which she must walk. After
that came the packing, she could manage nothing
<span id="page-127"></span>
but the necessary things. There were all the
things in her brides-chest to consider, all the
treasures her mother had saved up from her
babyhood and put in. She went to it by herself
and opened it, almost reverently, to have a last
look. She had room for none of those lovely
things; she would come back for them sometime.
Yet nestled on top was a small wooden box Rudolph
had carved and given her. In it were her amber
things, beads, ear-drops, brooch - and the
Dagmar Cross from her other confirmation. Ja,
she would take those to remember by, they would
take so little space in her valise.

By pre-arrangement, the coach came by for
Else next day at noon. She went at once to the
door of her mother's bedchamber to say farewell,
but it was shut fast. There was no answer when
she called "Goodbye, Mor" through the wood, though
she stood there hoping for a moment. The rest
all came outside to see her leave, even her father.
Mads put in her valise and boxes and the lunch
Karen had prepared, plus a little jug of hot coffee
and some warmed rocks for her feet. She kissed
each one goodby, one by one, and embraced them
fondly, even her father, though she had only slight
response from him in return. But then he said
quietly, as if to her ears alone, "If you ever
reconsider and change your mind daughter, you
will be welcomed back." Those were his last
words to her, for then he went inside fast and
closed the door, as if afraid of himself; but Else's
heart was cheered some. As she boarded the
coach then and sat down, turning to wave farewell
to the others, she saw her mother's face at the
front window, looking. That was the last she
ever saw of her.

## KOBBER&Oslash; . . . 1865-1866

The old coachman had no more wit than
heaven was pleased to grant him, which was little,
Else thought, as he immediately started a harangue
about things he had got wind of in the town. Some
of it concerned her, though he knew it not, and
Else's face reddened at what was being said of her
<span id="page-128"></span>
there. "If I were this ... wayward girl's
parents I'd ... plenty soon kick her out in the
street and shut the ... door in her face, snow
or no!" He dismissed that subject thus, though
his exact words were more highly embellished.
Else thought disgustedly, "My parents did not
kick me out nor shut the door in my face!" Then
she recalled Mor's shut door--but passed it off.
She had left voluntarily to save them added
embarrassment and grief - but she would return
under happier circumstances someday, she hoped.
She still longed for a miracle for her family.
"How far to Kobber&oslash;?" she asked along the
way. "About 28 kilometers [some 17 miles], but shorter 
as the bird flies," the coachman answered.

Else was relieved when they stopped at Stagstrup 
and picked up another passenger; it gave
the coachman other ears to talk into. She had
dreaded so many miles of loose chatter in her
direction. They were traveling slowly too, for
it was poor road, snow and ice mixed with mud,
and many deep ruts to pull through. The two
Danishmen smoked and exchanged gossip and
coarse jokes, punctuated with guffaws--some
about "Mormons". This conversation Else ignored
as best she could. She was not priggish, but there
was a manner of unmistakable dignity about her
which, after a time, made the others unconsciously
shut their mouths on the vulgar words and begin
talking of more respectable, though to them humdrum, 
affairs. Righteousness is a shield against
many things! Meanwhile, Else pulled her wrappings 
up closer about her and pretended to be dozing as
she busied herself with her own musings. She
could have wept from homesickness then and there
had she been alone, strange as it was. Courage
was something she was growing into slowly. She
had never traveled this far away, though she had
longed to without seriously thinking. It was just
that this particular going-away seemed to have
such a finality about it somehow, for it was surely
not very far as distances went. When next would
she be going back to her parents' cottage, she
wondered, and what lay ahead of her now? What
would she find of happiness or sorrow in Kobber&oslash;?
It is easier to look back on things, for then one sees
<span id="page-129"></span>
the beginning and the end at almost one and the
same minute.

Time was drawing well on into the late
afternoon when they pulled up at the coach barn in
Visby, about half way, to change teams. It was
bitter cold! Else ate her lunch then, and recalled
an old Scandinavian proverb which went something
like this:-- "When the days begin to lengthen, the
weather begins to strengthen." So too does the
Jutland wind, she thought; for they were now close
to the Limfjord and the wind was stiff and still
rising. The time of travel had seemed long but
she contented herself with the knowledge that all
things must draw to a close, both good and bad.
They continued on from Visby for another hour or
so, following the main thoroughfare going south,
then turned west at Ydby and followed a lesser
highway some distance to the town of Gettrup.
Here the other passenger alighted, and he seemed
to take much of the little warmth that had been in
the coach with him. Else was thoroughly chilled
and dark was gathering. They drove past a white
Parish church and on west from the town a spell,
then turned onto a farm road swinging southwest
towards the water again. She could see nothing
outside now, except where the coach lights cast
their gleam, but it was only two more miles
before they began passing straggling farm houses,
with lanterns hung out and dogs barking warnings
against their coming. They were approaching
Kobber&oslash;, the driver said, and Else straightened
her shawl and bonnet and began getting her baggage
in order, Then the long winter's ride ended for
her as the coachman pulled up right at the
Christensen's very door and dropped her.

Helped in hurridly out of the wind and cold,
midst most friendly greetings. Else was escourted
to a comfortable sitting room and soon seated by a
big open fire, which would have warmed her
thoroughly had not the cheery welcome of the
delightful family done it first. Here it seemed
then to her was the best she had ever had in all
her dreaming of it. As introductions were made
she marked the name of each, as well as the
appearance and manner. A well-bred, tidy and
<span id="page-130"></span>
comely family they were withal. Christen Christensen, 
the "husmand", an upstanding Dane of some
forty-eight years, was rather tall and somewhat
stern looking, but she took to him right away
nevertheless. His frail wife, Karen, younger
than he by more than nine years, was dark haired
and attractive, and to Else seemed as loving,
gentle and gracious a mistress as one could ever
wish for. The two sons, Christen and Laurs,
looked about her very age, but when she inquired
of it she found she was in between them. Christen,
the taller and heavier one, would soon be nineteen
while Laurs, a bit shorter but with curly hair and
far more handsome, was but seven months past
seventeen. Maren, the eldest daughter, had barely
turned sixteen, She was small of stature and very
pretty, but seemed to take herself somewhat
seriously. Pouline, almost ten, was the plainest
of the four girls and she was shy and prim.
Petrine, called "Trina", who would have her sixth 
birthday in less than two weeks, was the daintiest,
most loving and adorable little miss Else had ever
seen, and seemed like the gentle Karen in so many
ways. Sena, just past two-and-a-half years, clung
to her mother and hid her face till it was hard to
judge her. Then there were the two servants who
seemed pleasant enough--a lady cook and a housemaid, 
with whom Else was to share quarters. When Mr. Christensen 
asked her about herself and she told him somewhat of how 
she had been forced to seek employment, they all seemed to
wonder, and his wife clucked her tongue and said,
"O Ja, --think you any of us would have done it?"
Then the son Laurs spoke up, "Nej, --this was no
small thing it seems to me," and they all 
nodded -- all except young Christen. Ja, she 
was among friends!

Theirs was a rambling farmhouse and there
was plenty room for much happiness there. It had
been intended for many children, but the gentle
Karen had suffered the mishaps of losing four little
ones, three of them one after another from the
cradle as it were. Had all lived there would have 
been ten children living in the home now, all of
them having been born there in Kobber&oslash; in the
Parish of Gettrup, There were Christen, born
<span id="page-131"></span>
24 April 1846 (named for his father); Lauritz
Mathias Christian, called Laurs, born 22 July
1847 (just two days before the first band of Mormon 
Pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley) and who
was named for his mother's father, Lauritz
Jeppesen. Maren (later called Mary) born 14 Feb.
1849; Ane Marie (named after two of her father's
sisters) who was born 2 March 1850 and died in 
August the same year at five months; Peder
Christen, born 5 July 1851 and died at three years
eight months, 9 Mar. 1855 (named for his father's
brother who died young); Niels Christian, born 25
Apr. 1853, who died right away; Pouline (anglicized 
to Pauline) born 20 Mar. 1855, just eleven
days after her little brother Peder died (named for
her mother's maternal grandmother, Pouline
Kasgard); the first Petrine, born 4 May 1857 and
died 13 Mar. 1858, when ten months nine days old
(named also in memory of little dead Peder); the
second Petrine, called "Trina" (named for the
first, as was a Scandinavian custom) born 28 Feb.
1859, just a year lacking two weeks from the day
the first one died; and the last child, born 15 June
1862, called "Sena" but whose full name was
Nielsine Christiana (in remembrance of her 
brother Niels Christian who died soon after birth).

* * * * *

Christen Christensen himself had been born
29 July 1817 in the small scattered farm village
of Flarup, known earlier as Flarupgaard ("gaard"
meaning farm in Danish). It is situated a few
miles east of the town of Gettrup, midway between 
there and the larger town of Ydby, just over the
line into Ydby Parish. His father had been born 
in the same village, as had his father's father and
mother also; in fact, all of his progenitors, at
least back to the year 1592, both male and female,
had been born within a radius of not more than ten
miles from Flarup (Ydby, Dover, Gettrup, Helligs&oslash;,
Kobber&oslash;, etc.), or in Flarupgaard itself. 
Christen felt pretty certain, however, that all of
his forerunners had lived in that selfsame area
since before the time of the Vikings, even from
the beginning of habitation there.

The aforementioned small villages and towns
<span id="page-132"></span>
are all nestled in the southern part of that region
often referred to as Thyland, or "Thy", the lower
half and most western part of far North Jutland,
which is cut off from the rest of it by the beautiful
Limfjord, that unexpectedly meandering, lengthy
fjord which runs diagonally across the peninsula
east and west, from the Kattegat to the North Sea.
Carved out during the Ice Age, when the receding
glaciers formed the landscapes, this largest of
Denmark's numerous fjords which enhances the
graceful smiling and more fertile part of Thy, is
so studded with inlets, coves, bays and sister
fjords, into which its blue water enters, as to be
almost unbelievable! The fjord itself is framed
in picturesque bluffs and flats, although the scenery
around it is varied, and its shores harbor many cozy
smaller towns, as well as Thisted, the largest of
those in Thy, also the large city of Aalborg, some
distance northeast of this region. The waters of
the Limfjord also surround Mors, a good-sized
green island of scenic beauty which contains some
of the loveliest scenery in Denmark; containing
also many pleasant towns and villages, particularly
the ancient historical city of Nyk&oslash;bing and the town
of Feggeklit, the place where Prince Hamlet, the
Danish legend says, killed his uncle King Fegge,
in revenge for the murder of his father, Horvendil.

Thy is mostly a flat region of wide horizons
and great contrasts. Very near Flarup and west
of Hurup is the highest point in the entire region,
300 ft. above sea level, offering a beautiful view
of the area. Giant chalk formations are found in
some areas, especially in the most northwestern
part at Hanstholm, where is also one of the
strongest lighthouses in the world, overlooking the
North Sea, and built during Christen's time in 1842.
Some of the slopes along the Limfjord are rich with
moler, a clay found hardly anywhere else in the
world. It is best seen south of Thisted, where
many layers of volcanic ashes are visible in the
clay. From this clay, light, porous bricks for
insulation are made and exported to many countries.
To the west and north, Thy is bordered by the
cruel North Sea, which has been eating away at
the land for centuries, carving out and swallowing
well-off farms and even whole villages, or covering
<span id="page-133"></span>
them over with sand. In their places now is either
the ever-hungry sea or stretches of dunes and moors
whe re nothing good grows, and populated only by
birds and a few animals, Sand drifts have covered
much of the once fertile area northwest from
Kobber&oslash;. And still farther north and west from
there, near the town of Agger, entire villages have
disappeared over the last three centuries. Agger
Church was demolished and a new one raised more
north in 1838, and soon after that the first breakwaters 
were built there to control the North Sea,
both in Christen's time. (Recently, large dikes
have been constructed for the same purpose.)
On the east and south of Thy is the so-different
Limfjord and its bays. On its safe shores, Danes
have been settled from way back, including the
Viking Age, as witnessed by thousand-year old,
boat-shaped burial places which cover large areas,
and excavations from whence Vikings set forth on
their raids across the North Sea. Here just a few
miles east, as well as south from the village of
Flarup, in the peaceful bays of this lovely fjord,
the fleets of those fierce sailing warriors had
gathered for their expeditions to England, France
and the Mediterranean, a thousand years before.

But long before that there were people in
this area. One or two thousand years before the
birth of Christ, during the so-called Stone Age,
and the later Bronze Age, this was a comparatively
well populated part of the country. There is a
Bronze Age graveyard at Ydby Moor, very close
to Flarup, with more than 50 mounds. In fact,
several thousand of these mounds are scattered
all over Thy, and in its museums are relics,
original or in copy, of finds telling of those bygone
cultures, such as the famous Gold Boats from
Nors and the amber axes at Thisted museum. At
Lundeh&oslash;j, about ten or so miles east of Flarup, 
is one of the most impressive megalithic tombs in 
the whole country, purported to be about 5,000
years old, and at H&oslash;rdum Church, a few miles
southeast from N&oslash;rhaa, is kept the only known
stone hewn to the Nordic war-god, Thor. It
depicts his fight with the legendary Midgaard
Serpent. Very near Kobber&oslash;, northwest, is
Vestervig Church, once a cathedral. It was
<span id="page-134"></span>
erected around 1100 A.D., as a part of a big
Augustine monastery. North of the church is
Liden (Little) Kirstin's grave. According to legend,
Prince Buris (Henrikss&oslash;n) and Liden Kirstin,
the half sister of King Valdemar I, were buried
here after a tragic end to their love affair.

Yes indeed, Thy was a region where the
past was speaking and Christen Christensen of
Flarup believed his progenitors had been there
when the ancient history of the area was made.
Surely they must have gathered on the bays of the
Limfjord and struck out to sea in long-ships with
the early Vikings. Most likely they fought under
King Harold Bluetooth or Sweyn Forkbeard, Perhaps 
some watched on the blood-drenched battlefield of 
Lyndanisse in Estonia, 15 June 1219, when the Danes'
first flag "Dannebrog" supposedly floated down
from heaven, blood red with cross of white. Certainly 
some of his forefathers had been involved when, 
in 1340, the peasants of North Jutland
rebelled, and the powerful baldheaded Count Gert
marched up from Holstein with an army of 11,000
to quell them but was slain by a Jutlandic squire,
thus saving the Danes from the German rule they
so much dreaded. And when the North Jutland
peasants rebelled again in 1535, at the crowning
of King Christen III, some of his great-great-grandfathers 
must have joined them and stood up
bravely to fight for what they believed to be right,
and must have suffered also when the new King's
army slaughtered most of the citizens in Aalborg,
as well as over 2,000 Jutland peasants who had
rallied to make a last stand there. Jutland peasants
clung and died together, for there had always been
great fellowship among them through the ages.
There was little doubt in his mind either but that
various of his ancestors, over a period of almost
a thousand years, had fought nobly time and time
again, when calls came, in war after war to save
Jutland's neck, Slesvig, from the covetous Germans. 
(Christen's own son, young Christen, had
gone to battle in the recent war for this selfsame
reason -- 'twas a pity the Danes lost that one!)
Comparatively few in numbers, and never rich,
the Danish have waged, with desperate bravery,
wars far beyond their strength, Though they have
<span id="page-135"></span>
often lost, yet they have given stronger nations the
impression that it was best to leave them alone.
Yes, Christen the elder was mighty proud of his
forebearers, those stalwart peasant Danes from
Thy. He was grateful too for the part they had
played in building and preserving the kingdom.

It would have been easy to have failed in the
era and circumstances into which Christen found
himself plunged at birth, which was just three
years following the close of Napoleon's great rampage 
in Europe, that left so many of the countries
there upset. The Danish Kingdom herself had
been thrown into a state of discouragement. She
was bankrupt and had lost the control of Norway
besides; but above all she had lost her great 
Dano-Norwegian merchant fleet, second largest in the
world, next to England's. In fact, the country was
then regarded as being utterly impoverished and
on the verge of disintegration. It was in this
austere national atmosphere of disappointment and
soberness then that he grew up. Reconstruction
proceeded but slowly at first, general conditions
were extremely poor and throughout the land
things seemed to be at a standstill.

The Absolute Monarch, Frederick II, was
ruling in Denmark at this time. He had likely 
made many wrong decisions, for he was not genius
enough to be able to keep on top of things during
that Napoleonic whirlwind, but his integrity was
beyond question and besides he was dearly beloved,
particularly by the peasants of his kingdom, for
the reforms he had brought about in the earlier
years of his reign in their behalf. At the age of
15, each Danishman became liable for military
service and could be called to serve in the King's
army or navy anytime between ages 15 and 39. If
there was war in Denmark no physically able male
in this age bracket got out of it, unless perhaps he
could hire someone to fight for him. In peacetime
one might "draw a pass" when there was no great
demand for soldiers. The law still remained that
all males be placed on the military levying rolls
at birth (at least until 1850), but Frederick VI did
away with the "bound-to-the-soil" law and from
that time forth peasants could live anywhere they
<span id="page-136"></span>
liked. At the same time it was decreed by him
that peasants could once again buy and own their
own farms and land. (This was a great step forward, 
for they had been deprived of this freeman
privilege of owning property since the days of
King Christian III, having been forced since that
time to either rent their lands and pay manorial
dues in money, crops and labor to the nobles,
church or state, or labor entirely on the large
estates of these great landowners.) Agriculture
was given a lift in the country through the 
introduction of improved methods of cultivation, new
farm implements and better ploughs.

* * * * *

Christen Christensen, the father of the family,
had good reasons to be proud in his own right,
aside from the accomplishments of his ancestors;
for he himself was no ordinary fellow. He had
been brought up in the era "after Napoleon" in a
Danish household of modest demands and thriftiness.
Likely he attended school at the parish town of Ydby
in winters, from age eight to twelve inclusive,
walking to and fro for that purpose in all sorts of
weather. In summers he must have helped on the
farm his father had been able to take over from
his father. When he was two months short of his
fifteenth birthday and the "age of fighting", so to
speak, his father, also named Christen Christensen,
had passed away nine days following his forty-third
birthday (1832) and, being the eldest child, Christen
had taken over the family farm, as well as the
support of his mother Maren and the younger
children:-- Karen, age eleven; Jens Christian,
eight and a half; Marie, age six; and Anne, just
past three years four months. Anne's twin, Maren,
had died soon after birth, January 1829, and the
boy Peder at age eleven, 1830, there having been
seven children in the family in all.

It is doubtful if Christen himself was called
into military service, either in his teens or
twenties, the country being at peace during those
years and the king being anxious to build up Danish
farms and agriculture again. He must have grieved
with other Danish peasants when old Frederick VI
died, in 1839, and been somewhat dubious as well
<span id="page-137"></span>
when the old king's cousin became King Christian
VIII, for he was middle-aged and had little foresight. 
Christen apparently hadn't thought much
about marriage, or at least hadn't done anything
about it, until sometime after his twenty-seventh
birthday. But then he courted and won the hand
of the lovely Karen Lauritzen, youngest daughter
of the widow Marianne Jeppesen of the town of
Gettrup nearby. On 25 March 1845, when he
lacked four months of being twenty-eight and
Karen was eighteen and a half, the two were
married in the Parish Church at Gettrup, soon
after their engagement intentions had been duly
advertised by the Pastor there. Christen must
have sold or given up the family farm to his
younger and only living brother, Jens Christian,
then or soon after, for he took his bride to live
in the village of Kobber&oslash;, some five miles from
Flarup and half of that from Gettrup. Jens stayed
on in Flarup and likely ran the family farm and
kept a home for his mother and sisters, and subsequently 
married a widow lady there. Christen
and Karen both had relatives in Kobber&oslash; and so
he bought a farm there and settled. He had built
that farm until it had become one of the richest
and best in the whole area and he was considered
one of the most successful farmers around. He
employed a number of laborers, both on the farm
and in the house. Aside from this he manufactured
farm implements on his place, for which he had
good market. He was a lover of thoroughbred
horses and owned a number, as well as his own
up-to-date and impressive carriage. He loved
sports and was a fine wrestler and jumper, as
well as being clever at horseshoes. He had
numerous friends and relatives in South Thy,
being well known and well respected withal. Yes,
Christen Christensen was a well-to-do, successful,
selfmade man, one might say, and besides had
fathered ten children and provided well for his
household.

The gentle Karen herself was a woman of
high intelligence and refinement, with a deep
spiritual nature. She had been born in Gettrup,
8 Sept. 1826, the youngest of the three children,
all daughters, born to Lauritz Jeppesen
<span id="page-138"></span>
(anglicized to Laurs Jepsen) and Marianne Elizabeth
Kristensen Eskov (anglicized to Mariane
Christensen). (Eskov was the name of the place
from whence her great-great paternal grandfather,
Peder S&oslash;rensen, had originated, having been born
there around 1678.) Her father's progenitors had
lived right there in the area of Gettrup for more
than two centuries at least, for there was a record
of them back to her fourth great-grandparents,
Eric Nielsen and his wife Mette Jensen Nielsen,
who were each born in Kobber&oslash;gaard about 1604
and 1610 respectively. So Karen too must have
descended from the early Vikings of Thy and their
predecessors there. But Karen's mother's forerunners 
had not come from Thy, as far back as
they knew, but from across the Limfjord east and
south, where its waters had pushed themselves in
to form several smaller fjords and bays, including
Skive Fjord. It was here on the shores of Skive
Fjord in the large city of Skive that her mother
had been born, the youngest of the four daughters,
of Kristen Kristensen (Eschou) and Pouline
Kasgaard. Kristen's people were from Selde,
some ten miles or so north from there but had
originally come from the village of Eschou (Eskou
or Eskuer) midway between Selde and Skive.
Pouline Kasgaard may have been from Skive, in
Skive Parish, but there is reason to believe she
was from much farther south, in Viborg, since
the first three of her four daughters had been born
there, only the fourth, Karen's mother Marianne,
having been born in Skive. It was from the cathedral 
city of Viborg, that ancient cultural center in
mid-Jutland, that Jutland's royal army had ridden,
from time immemorial, southward by horse and
cart, to Denmark's ancient border near Danevirke
to fight off the Germans. (Where the modern highway 
has not replaced the old road, cart tracks
dating back several centuries may still be traced
in the heather and near the fjords.)

On 8 Dec. 1843, when Karen was just two
months past her seventeenth birthday, her father
died at age sixty-five years nine months, leaving
her mother, herself and her two older sisters,
Maren, just a week past twenty-one and Ane,
nineteen and a half. In less than a year-and-a-half
<span id="page-139"></span>
after his death all three of the girls had 
married:-- Maren, 20 Oct. 1844 to Niels Thomsen; Ane, 2 Mar.
1845 to Poul Jensen; and Karen, two and-a-half
weeks after Ane, 25 Mar. 1845 to Christen Christensen 
of Flarup. All three couples were married
in the Parish Church in Gettrup and, strange as it
may seem, all took up their first residence in
Kobber&oslash;, although Ane and her husband later
moved to Hillerslev, nearby. The girls' mother
more than likely moved to Kobber&oslash; too and took
turns living with her daughters, although she must
have spent most of her time with her youngest,
Karen, because she needed her the most. Maren
only had one son, young Christen's age, while
Ane had two girls and two boys but lost the first
girl soon after birth.

Karen's mother must have been with her
when her first five babies were born, and also
there to give aid and comfort when wee Ane
Marie had died, the first child to leave the nest.
Bedstemoder Marianne herself had been the next
one to go, passing away just seven months after
her tiny granddaughter, 25 Mar. 1852, which
happened to be Karen's and Christen's seventh
wedding anniversary. They had the church bell
tolled for her, and the funeral and the "dirt casting", 
and laid her beside her husband Lauritz in
the churchyard at Gettrup where they had so
recently placed little Ane Marie to rest. There
were so many of their kindred at rest there in
that Gettrup Parish churchyard, and more to
come, It was Karen's uncle, the widower Peder
Jeppesen, a brother of her father, who had taken
his place there next, having died just a month
after Marianne. Then one by one, within the next
few years, three more of Karen's babies had been
buried in that same burial ground. It wasn't long
before the newer graves had hedges growing all
around, with flowers blooming inside in summers
like all the others; mute evidence that love, birth
and death, the tapestry of life, is little altered,
in the main, no matter when or where its threads
are woven. But death had seemed to strike so
often there then. It was small comfort that the
churchyards were sometimes far more beautiful
than parks, with their white churches hovering
<span id="page-140"></span>
above the flower-grown graves, their bell towers
always facing west toward the setting sun; for
what hope did these churches and their priests
offer the bereaved? "From dirt thou camest and
to dirt thou returnest" were the words spoken by
those who cast the "holy dirt" into the tombs.

This Christensen family had always attended
the Parish church at Gettrup, the gentle Karen
having been very particular about church going,
as her mother Marianne had been before her. The
births and baptisms of each of her children had been
duly acknowledged and registered by the Priest
there, all except little Niels Christian who had
died in his sins right away before there had been
time to have him "d&oslash;bt"[^1]. This had been a cankering 
sorrow to the family ever since, but especially
to the gentle Karen whose grief at the time had been
pitiful indeed. They had done everything they
could to make amends for this neglect. The little
dead ones had all been buried in the churchyard
there, as mentioned, and the three older ones,
Christen, Laurs, and Maren, had each received
their confirmations in the church there, in their
turns, as had Karen and her sisters done in theirs.
The family as a whole had been very faithful in the
church attendance on "Holy Days" at Easters and
Christmases and even regular services and masses.
Christen himself had contributed consistently to
the upkeep of the Parish, as well as the salary of
the priest. Karen read and studied her Bible often
and had become somewhat acquainted with the
scriptures. The church congregations in Gettrup
were usually made up mostly of the Christensens'
relatives and friends, but few were as religious as
they, especially as Karen, for she herself was a
most devout Lutheran.

[^1]: Actually, Niels Christian's birth (23 Apr 1853) as well as his christening in church two days later do appear in the Gettrup parish register (1849-73, p. 8), as do his death (21 Sep) and burial (2 Oct, p. 102). Karen did, however, deliver a stillborn male child the following Apr 5th (p. 8).  It may be that they had intended to name this child, if a boy, after the infant Niels Christian who had died a few months earlier and therefore thought of this stillborn child as a second Niels Christian.  In the end, though, it was their youngest daughter Nielsine Christiane (b. 1862)  who was named after Niels Christian.

The education of the Christensen children
had not been neglected either. Christen, Laurs,
and Maren had each attended the free church-sponsored 
school provided in their area, from
ages eight through twelve as the law required.
Their father, a selfmade man himself, had likely
considered that enough formal education for them,
believing more in the value of practical experience
and honest toil as an educator. Although he often
<span id="page-141"></span>
employed farm hands and maidservants, especially
in later years, yet he had insisted on the boys
working on the farm and Maren in the house.
Karen had sincerely tried to teach her children
something of the great art of living she herself
had learned so well:--courtesy, refinement,
mastery of self and the means of life about them,
enjoyment of simple things and appreciation for
all that was good.


The daughter Pouline had also started school
when she was eight but dropped out the forepart of
her second year, at Yuletide. Now Danish officials
were determined that there would be no illiteracy
in the country, yet it was permissable for children
to remain away from school if good enough reasons
could be found. If a child were sickly, or needed
by the parents in the home, or if the distance were
too far to school or the weather too rough, one
could remain at home during the school term provided 
arrangements could be made for him or her
to be properly taught in the home. What excuse
the Christensens gave for Pouline's absence from
the school is uncertain; perhaps it was the weather,
or again it may have been the fact that there was
already a governess employed in the home. However, 
the real crux of the matter was that they had
removed their daughter from the State school to
save her from possible embarrassment or harsh
treatment there, since it had lately been rumored
about the area that the Christensens were "Mormon
lovers".

It had all started to happen when the gentle
Karen, in her sweet way, had opened the door to
two Mormon missionaries and let them in out of
the cold. That they had been kinder to her than
she to them that day she had scarcely realized,
yet they had warmed her heart with the beauty of
the Restored Gospel. Being much impressed with
their words she had invited the Elders to return.
Meantime she had taken to studying her Bible
more in order to determine if the words they had
spoken were true. She told Christen about their
visit, insisting that what the Mormon missionaries
had said agreed with the scriptures yet disagreed
with what the priest had told his congregations.
<span id="page-142"></span>
Her husband had taken little stock in the affair to
begin with, but made no objection to the Elders
coming if she wished it, though he knew somewhat
of the reputation of the Mormons. He was one to
pamper his wife, and besides he trusted Karen's
judgment.

On their next visit the Elders brought with
them the "new Bible" or Book of Mormon, and left
it with her. She had started to read then and hardly
put the book down for days until she had read it
through. Her soul burned with a knowledge of the
truth of it, as she poured over its pages, and she
rejoiced. There was one section in the last of the
book that astonished her perhaps more than any
other and she re-read it carefully, over and 
over:-- Moroni 8:11-21 "...little children need no repentance, 
neither baptism..." (She skipped some here
and there.) "Behold I say unto you, that he that
supposeth that little children need baptism is in
the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity...
For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God
saveth one child because of baptism, and the other
must perish because he has no baptism. Little
children cannot repent... And he that saith that
little children need baptism denieth the mercies
of Christ... Woe unto such, for they are in danger
of death, hell and an endless torment. I speak it
boldly; God hath commanded me -- listen -- and
give heed..." As Karen read these things she
cried out with happiness, "Our little 
Niels -- the priest was wrong - wrong!" And she knew it
fully then.

It had taken only a few more visits and discussions 
with the Elders until Karen had known she
was ready for baptism by immersion, as the Lord
had commanded. However, though she pressed
them for it then eagerly, the missionaries had no
desire to break up that lovely family with a lone
baptism; so, as the weeks passed, they began
more and more to involve the whole Christensen
family in their cottage meetings, with Karen's
help. All except the son Christen finally came
around to listen and discuss, but he would have
nothing at all to do with any "Mormons!" The
daughter Maren soon became deeply impressed
<span id="page-143"></span>
also, but whether it was so much with Mormonism
as with the handsome missionary, Elder Myrup,
was not quite clear, even to the young lady herself.
One could see that the son Laurs was somewhat
moved by it all, yet was being held back by his
older brother's opinions. It is hard to stand
against ridicule when one is seventeen! Christen
the father seemed to have a lot of thinking to do
about the whole thing. Most Scandinavians who
were embracing the gospel in those days were
poor or meek, but this Dane was neither. The
little girls went about their own small affairs
knowing naught of the magnitude of the decisions
being made then in the home.

The Christensens had been without a governess 
for a number of weeks, their former one 
having left in a huff when the Mormon missionaries
had begun to call at the farmhouse. Seemingly a
Mormon-hater, she had soon started some unkind
rumors about them in the village; doubtless falling
back on gossiping to seem important, having so
little in and of herself in the world with which to
put that point over, like so many of her kind. The
word that her recent employers were "Mormon
sympathizers" brought no immediate violence to
the offenders, as she had likely anticipated. Certainly 
it was not like it had been in the area, and
not so long ago either, when quiet, hard-working,
honest farm families could be meeting with friends
and neighbors, singing and praying one minute and
the next facing a howling mob seemingly intent on 
their extermination. The reaction then, in the
midst of that bitter winter, had more or less
taken on the form of vehement talking "behind
backs", as it were. The usual rabble-rousers
used up their energy in virile, abusive words
against them, telling what they would do "come
spring" perhaps. Some others of their friends
and neighbors scowled at them or shunned them,
and a number of their relatives who lived closeby
ran right over to see what it was all about, and
when they learned, commenced to call them "fools".
'Twas said the priest himself had plenty bad to say
of them. Perhaps he was worried about his pocket
money, since the family no longer joined his 
congregations. Christen senior couldn't have cared
<span id="page-144"></span>
less what people said or how they reacted, though
he was somewhat surprised at the bigotry of some
of the best of them. But if there was bitterness on
any side it could not hold a candle to the bitterness
of the weather, which continued to beat, bite and
bruise any flesh forced to be out in it for long. And
so matters had stood in Kobber&oslash; when the new
governess arrived.

* * * * *

The weather continued so through the rest of
February and all of March that winter of 1865.
Notwithstanding, the two Mormon Elders continued
to labor faithfully with the Christensens and other
farm families in the area, visiting them often and
usually wading through heavy snow and enduring
severe cold to do so. They now had quite a number 
of sincere investigators and a few others, like
Karen and Maren, who were ready for baptism.
The importance and influence of the Christensens
had been quite a factor in bringing in investigators
who were pleased to follow their example and who
often came to meetings in their home. Baptisms
in the open were impossible then, as the weather
stood, but the missionaries were looking forward
to spring when they hoped for quite a "harvest of
souls" in Gettrup Parish. Though they had
received no commitments from either Laurs
Christensen or his father, they felt they were
making progress, especially with the younger man,
The new Mormon governess there seemed to be
having quite an influence on his thinking.

Else Katherine Andersen was happy in the
Christensen home, at least as happy as one could
be under the circumstances of feeling quite forgotten 
by her own family. These people with whom
she now resided had treated her most kindly; in
fact she had been led to feel more like a member
of the family than a servant. She had learned to
love the gentle Karen like a second mother. They
had much in common in their love for the gospel
and often studied and talked of it together. Else's
special charges, the three younger daughters,
were her delight. She had learned to love them
with all her heart. The shy Pouline had come to
trust her for she had done so much to encourage
<span id="page-145"></span>
the young girl in her special abilities. Trina had
been no problem from the first; she knew they
would be friends forever. The little one, Sena,
had to be weaned somewhat from her mother's
skirts and Else fell back on the stories of her
childhood to do this, for Sena loved stories and
jingles. "Tommeltot fell in the water; Slikkepot
fished him out; Langemand carried him home;
Guldbrand put him to bed, and Lille Peder Spillemand 
sat in the corner and tattled." This one the
small girl learned to say, pulling at her own
fingers the while. When it was time for bed the
story about "Ole Luk&oslash;je"[^2] was what Sena coaxed
for and she usually got it, since nothing else
would quiet her. "Ole Luk&oslash;je comes up the stairs
in his stocking feet, opens the door 
noiselessly --- and st! --- squirts a small, small stream 
of sweet milk in the childrens' eyes to prevent them
from staying open. He creeps among them and
blows softly upon their necks. . . He doesn't hurt
them, for Ole is very fond of the children; he only
wants them to be quiet. . ." By this time Sena
was most always sound asleep. As Else tended
and entertained the children, and as she taught
them their lessons, she also taught them about
the gospel, as her mistress, the gentle Karen,
had suggested. Someday they would be baptised
like she had been, in the deep water.

[^2]: Ole Luk&oslash;je (Ole Close-eye) is a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale.

March passed and April came; these were
the months for birthdays in N&oslash;rhaa -- Mor's, Far's,
Christen's, Karen's and Mads'. Mads had turned
twenty now. Else longed to hear from her family
but had received no word since coming to Kobber%oslash;,
although she had written right away to send her
address and tell of her circumstances. There had
been plenty of time in spite of delayed mails. She
hid her disappointment deep and went ahead with
her work. The weather was warming at last and
the Christensen men were preparing for their
planting. Mr. Christensen she greatly admired,
he was a man of strong character. Else trusted
him and felt he did so with her. The son Laurs
she had grown fond of for he was so full of wit and
humor and such good company; besides he was
becoming continually more sympathetic with the
gospel teachings, as they discussed them. In all
<span id="page-146"></span>
but that he seemed much like her brother Mads.
The older daughter, Maren, had kept her distance,
as she could, seeming to be jealous of the apparent
friendliness between Else and the missionaries,
especially Elder Myrup. But had he not been the
one to get Else this position? She kept well her
secret that she knew about Elder Myrup and his
hopes for Maren, as mentioned in his letter to
Elder Hansen. The antagonistic son Christen
bothered her, yet she pitied him -- perhaps the
war had made him that way; he had been young to
go a-fighting - just like Mads. This one had so
much happiness within his grasp but wouldn't see
it. He constantly complained of everything, including 
the farm work. He wished to try his hand at a
craft or trade, 'twas far better than working on a
farm for a miserable salary, he said. He was
handy at the making of farm implements, like his
father, but disliked that too. He wanted to be off,
that was the truth of it. There were many traveling
craftsmen, tradesmen and salesmen in the area,
and when the sun shone they came out like houseflies, 
plying their crafts and trades and making
tolerable good businesses at them too. There
were watchmakers, carpenters, shoemakers,
harness and wagon makers, roof thatchers,
salesmen of tin goods and lithographs, mechanics,
etc., and even dressmakers and tailors, going
from house to house and door to door peddling
their wares and services.

Kobber&oslash; was situated near the meandering
Limfjord, where an arm of it came twining itself
through the land there in south Thy, reaching out
northwesterly towards the sea and caressing
green or sandy shores of bays, coves, inlets and
smaller fjords on its way. On the fjord's east
bank, midway between the waters of Fjordgrund
and Krik Vig, the village itself lay looking across
ten miles or so to Thybor&oslash;n Harbor, or south to
Nissum Bay in the distance. Where in this large
and beautiful bay, Viking fleets and their fearless
crews had gathered from north, south and east ten
centuries before to await their devastating raids
west across the North Sea. And farther northwest
<span id="page-147"></span>
from Kobber&oslash;, on past Krik Vig to the shores of
this rough sea, near Aggerborg, can still be seen
excavations from whence those early sea-kings
once set forth in their long-ships. A fjord town or
village on the shores of the Limfjord, such as
Kobber&oslash;, was a lovely place to be in the springtime. 
Picture looking out towards Nissum Bay
and seeing the sky reflected in enchanting, pastel
colors in its blue waters, while crafts of all
descriptions glide to and fro upon its surface,
from small open fishing boats being rowed along
to large sailing vessels with their giant white sails
spread and their blur of red and white flags flapping
in the brisk breeze. Imagine herring nets billowing 
against the blue sky between weatherbeaten
posts of silver grey, flights of birds wheeling,
dipping and circling in a water ballet, and far off
on the very brink of heaven, flocks of plump little
fleecy white clouds, like lambs grazing.

Here were smokehouses dotted along the
green sloping shores. Danes were fond of smoked
herring. In fact, most Danes were fond of fish of
any kind, fish having fed their ancestors since the
beginning - far longer than farms had. There
were numerous fishermen in the vicinity of 
Kobber&oslash; and many there who loved the sea. It
was often said, jokingly, that the children in this
area were born with oars in their hands. Not all
here, however, were sea-going Danes, for there
were some, like the Christensens, who were proverbially 
reluctant to sail out farther than they
could row back. For though they loved the water and had 
been raised to the rhythmic sound of its 
splashing, yet they much preferred having their
feet firmly planted on solid ground, being 
land-Danes, as it were.

Many farms were scattered about, for
Kobber&oslash; was primarily a village of farms, 
varying in size. A Danish farmyard could be a 
very picturesque place. The house and accompanying 
farm buildings were usually built around a
courtyard in a sort of U shape, in the center of 
which would likely be a tall flagpole, watering
trough, water pump, and possibly a windmill.
Barn, pigpen, chicken coop, outhouse, granery,
<span id="page-148"></span>
smokehouse, corral and sheds, as well as the
dwelling itself, would all be built in the country's
own products -- grey stone, clay, forest wood and
straw. The half-timbered farmhouse itself might
boast a modern red tile roof, but the other buildings
would all be thatched with straw. The individual
farm largely supplied the food requirements of
the family, outside of fish, salt, coffee, tea and
some fruits. Cereal, root crops, potatoes, oats,
barley and wheat were raised in abundance, as
well as garden vegetables, berries, currants,
prunes, rhubarb, etc. Some Danes even grew
trees whose leaves were edible, such as the
B&oslash;getrae whose branches were picked in the spring
and placed in vases in the homes. Cattle, pigs,
sheep, chickens, ducks and geese and the like,
provided meat aplenty, as well as eggs, lard,
bacon, cheese and butter. A favorite with some
Danes was clabber milk, or "thick milk" as they
called it. Good cooks were the rule in most farm
homes and farmers and their families, like most
other Danes, were generally well fed. Some of
the materials for clothing, such as leather and
wool, were raised on the farm also and most
everything the family wore was made there, with
the aid of traveling shoemakers, dressmakers,
tailors, etc. Danish peasants or farm people
were always well clothed, if not fashionably, but
they could dress up as gaily as the best, in their
"national costumes" if the occasion required it.

The Danes themselves were a fine race,
usually tall and athletically trained. In the country
districts, such as Thy, they were kind and hospitable 
with an easy independence of bearing. The
natives of Thy, perhaps the harshest part of Denmark, 
were possibly more hardy and vigorous, in
the main, because of the process of natural
selection, the weaker ones dying off young.
Jutland in general was sometimes referred to as
the "dark continent", particularly by Danes of the
Island cities. This was probably because of the
seeming backwardness of its people, the country
manner and country dress, including wooden shoes,
but more especially because of the peculiar Danish
brogue spoken in parts such as Thy -- "Danish
words all chewed up and swallowed and then spit
<span id="page-149"></span>
out of the throat", and sounding almost as harsh
as the land was itself. But in spite of it all, the
blood of Israel, and some of the finest blood in
the kingdom of Denmark, flowed in the veins of
the farming Jutlanders of Thy. Among these, and
surely not the least of them, were the Christen
Christensens of Kobber&oslash;. In fact, to many of
the people of this area Christen Christensen
himself was known as "the great man of the north".

News from other parts of the world came to
Kobber&oslash; through the Danish newspapers, letters
from emigrants and other world travelers, and
from returning seamen. It must have been noted
with interest there, as elsewhere in Europe, that
the great American Civil War--a terrible internal
struggle--which had been raging for more than
three years had been finally brought to a close.
On 9th April, that spring of 1865, the Confederate
General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union
forces under General Ulysses S. Grant. With this
the famous American President, Abraham Lincoln,
had not only freed the black slaves of his country
but had preserved the Union as well. There was
genuine rejoicing at this, not only in the United
States but in other countries, including Denmark.
However, five days later, the night of April 14th,
in the midst of the joyful celebrations in the American 
capital city of Washington, D. C., while
Lincoln was attending the theatre there, he was
shot and killed by an assassin, John Wilkes Booth.
The happiness of the world at this outstanding man's
successes turned as suddenly to sorrow at his
death. Robert Ingersoll wrote of the great
emancipator, Abraham Lincoln:-- "He was the
courage, the hope and the nobility of a nation. He
knew no fear except the fear of wrong doing.
Wealth could not purchase, power could not awe
this divine - this loving man. It is the glory of
Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he
never abused it except on the side of mercy."
The famous story teller of Denmark, Hans
Christian Andersen, was a contemporary of
Abraham Lincoln and so was Christen Christensen
of Kobber&oslash;. All lived at a time when great things
<span id="page-150"></span>
were happening in the world and important decisions
were being made.

Seventeen days following the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln, while the world still mourned
his passing, an event took place near Kobber&oslash;,
Denmark, which was to change the lives of many
people. On May 1st, 1865 a small group of Danish
people wended their way down a green sloping bank
to a cove of water which had stolen away from the
main body of the Limfjord into a nook of the land
there. Here it lay, sheltered from the wind and
prying eyes, sunning itself. Among the group who
came to disturb its placid waters that beautiful
spring day were all of the members of the Christensen 
family of Kobber&oslash; (except the eldest son
Christen), their governess, Else K. Andersen, the
missionary Lars N. C. Myrup and his companion,
and several others who had come, like the rest,
either as spectators or for baptism. Two of the
Christensen family were prepared to enter the
waters of baptism that day: the mother, Karen
Lauritzen Christensen, and the eldest daughter
Maren. Karen was eager to be first for she had
waited so long for that precious moment when she
could become a real member of the L. D. S.
church. She was baptized and then confirmed by
Elder Myrup, assisted by his missionary companion. 
Maren came next and it was also Elder
Myrup who baptized and confirmed her a member.
Others from the small congregation assembled
there on the banks of the cove were also baptized
and confirmed, and then the simple services were
ended. The gentle Karen had been given one of her
greatest desires in life, yet she was grieved because
her husband and her sons had failed to be baptized
that day.

Christen senior had been seriously considering the 
step for quite a while. In fact the urge to
be baptized had kept yanking at his coattails for
weeks but his Danish stubbornness had kept halding
him back. Why hadn't he thought of the whole thing
first? The night following his wife's baptism, as
he and she were preparing to retire, Karen spoke
to him of the great peace that had come into her
heart with the administration of those holy
<span id="page-151"></span>
ordinances, and then she said, rather 
wistfully, -- "But it will be so difficult to emigrate to Zion
without you, my love." These last words stunned
him - that was something else he hadn't thought
about first either. Well now if this was how the
wind was blowing it was a different matter entirely!
Next day Christen made a special visit to the
lodgings of the Mormon missionaries, and the
following day, May 3rd 1865, accompanied by the
two delighted Elders, he himself went down to the
water and was baptized and confirmed a member
of the new church by Elder Myrup, assisted by the
other Elder. Five days later, 8 May 1865, another
baptism session was held in the cove near Kobber&oslash;
and the son Laurs (Lauritz Mathias Christian
Christensen) and the daughter Pouline were baptized 
and confirmed members by Elder Lars 
Myrup, assisted by his companion, together with
a few other investigators from Gettrup Parish.
With this the gentle Karen's cup of joy was
almost overflowing. But there was still the son
Christen, whose bitterness for the Mormons was
growing steadily -- yet a mother's heart never
gives up!

One could say this much for the father,
Christen Christensen of Kobber&oslash;: whenever he
went into something he went in all over! As far
as he was concerned, from the moment of his
baptism and as long as he lived, nothing was too
good for the Restored Church and its missionaries.
Right away he helped to secure a rented hall in the
town of Gettrup where the few members of the
church in the area could hold services. He and
his family attended regularly and assisted in
fellowshipping new members by inviting them to
their home. They fed and entertained the missionaries 
and did everything they could to further the
work of the Lord in that small part of His vineyard.
It wasn't long before a goodly part of the discussions 
at the meetings were about emigration.
The Millennial Star, an LDS church publication
printed in England but translated into Danish,
carried this message:-- "The poor, the pure in
heart will be brought singing to Zion. . . let all
who can procure a loaf of bread and one garment
on their backs be assured there is water plenty
<span id="page-152"></span>
and pure by the way. And doubt no longer but come
next year to the place of gathering, even in flocks,
as doves fly to their window before the storm."
"Emigration" -- this was a magic word now for
these new Saints; to Zion they must surely 
go - next year!

The seasons moved ahead. Nightingales sang
in the long evenings of late spring - a choir of
innumerable, invisible musicians. At midsummer
the cool waves of the Limfjord and its numerous
water-relatives, and the various bathing beaches
dotting their shores, attracted vacationers, bathers
and boaters. In late summer and early autumn the
heather began blooming. And then it was harvest time again.
There was a bountiful one in Kobber&oslash;
and all hands were called outside to help with it.
Even the maidservants at the Christensens, including 
Else, were put to harvesting the crops. This
would mean more money all around for emigrating,
for by now it had been pretty well agreed that all
who desired it would go to America the following
spring. Elder Myrup would be going, as well as
Else, and of course the whole Christensen family
except Christen Jr.

By now Else was receiving regular mail from
home, from Mads and the girls, but not one written
word had she from her parents.  It was all the same
small talk as usual, avoiding the fact that they were
living in two separate worlds of believing.  All were
well at home, they said, except Christen, who was
poorly. The warm weather had brought Stine out of
of her ailment and she was blooming like a rose 
again. Neither she or Karen, however, had suitors 
yet. Marie was plumper than ever.  Mor and Far
were still very much upset with her and ashamed
for her also, though they seemed to expect her back
most any day, disillusioned, and ready to make
amends for her sins, and her peace with the priest.
Rumor had it that Rudolph would soon marry a girl
from K&oslash;benhavn and settle down there. There were
always plenty of good wishes and much love included
at the end, and sometimes a P.S. - "By the way,
when are you coming back home?" So they thought
it was just a little fling she was having. Perhaps
She would never go back. But oh to link arms with
<span id="page-153"></span>
them again - to talk the way they had before - to
sit together on the bench beside the door and watch
the moon come up, and listen to the cry of the
nightingale!

In November and December the wind was
howling cold again. In the Christensen household
every extra moment was being directed towards
the goal of emigration. Instructions had been
received from the Branch headquarters at Aalborg.
It would be no simple matter to go from one life to
another; to cross an ocean and a vast continent - to 
leave "Babylon" for the "Kingdom of God".
Six or seven months would be required, "Convert
everything possible into cash", the authorities
advised; so Christen began disposing of his stock.
No use feeding more than necessary through the
winter; the hay and grain saved would bring a good
price. "Be frugal and thrifty and save as much as
you can toward leaner days" was suggested; so
Karen watched the kitchen and the cooking more
closely. Leftovers and scraps were good for
sauces and soup stocks; fish balls in soup were
cheaper than meat balls, and just as nourishing.
Some of the help was dismissed but a sewing lady
was engaged to come into the home and get started
on wardrobes for the family. Maren herself was
already an excellent little seamstress and made
many of her own things. Her clothes were always
just a little better than the ordinary. Sorting began;
so much would have to be left behind, since the
usual emigrant equipment was supposed to average
not more than one hundred pounds per person.
There would be no room for the unnecessaries
and little, if any, for family keepsakes and treasures. 
They were cautioned to bring along a year's
supply of clothing, if possible. Costumes for
sailing would differ from those that should be
worn on desert trails and in the valleys of the
mountains. Food would be supplied or could be
purchased along the way.

It was a custom in Denmark at this time for
the family farm to be passed down from father to
eldest son. Young Christen would have been in
line to inherit the Christensen property, had all
been as usual; but it was now necessary that the
<span id="page-154"></span>
holdings be sold to assure emigration funds for the
rest of the family. So Christen senior began
casting about for a possible buyer for his land.
Ready money was needed right away, because all
who planned to emigrate were required to make
deposits for their ship passages and railway
tickets well in advance, in order that arrangements 
could be made with authorities both in Denmark and
America.  The fare from Copenhagen, Denmark, to the town 
of Wyoming, Nebraska, U. S. A., the outfitting 
place for the Saints who were to cross the plains
in 1866, was about 82 Danish rigsdaler or $42.00
in American money for each adult person.  Children
could travel for half fare.  This meant that 
transportation for the Christensen family for this 
part of the journey alone would cost around 440 
rigsdaler.  Else would be required to pay at least 
80 rigsdaler in advance.  The trip to Aalborg and
from thence to Copenhagen would be extra and there 
would be money needed for supplies at Wyoming, 
as well as plenty to defray incidental expenses
along the way. Christen Christensen was blessed 
in being a man of some means; most planning to
emigrate were much, much less fortunate.

Besides the physical preparations for the
going-away, there were moral and spiritual details 
to be looked after - the "Word of Wisdom" for 
instance. Snaps and tobacco were not difficult for
the Christensen men to give up, once they put their
minds to it, but tea and coffee were another matter.
It was hard for Scandinavians to get along without
their coffee. The hours of the day could be counted 
by the number of cups of coffee served in a Danish 
household. The old black coffeepot stood enshrined 
on the back of every kitchen stove, always filled 
with the hot beverage, ready for pouring. The
early church authorities were somewhat lenient 
with the Saints of the northland where coffee was 
concerned, for this habit seemed to be such an 
intrinsical part of their lives. When the pure, cool 
drinking water of Zion could be substituted, it
would be time enough for them to change.

Christmas was a wonderful time for the
Christensens and members of their household that 
year. There was genuine thanksgiving and rejoicing
<span id="page-155"></span>
among them, for all were filled with great hopes
for the future, fully expecting to see the land of
America and the Great Salt Lake before another
Yuletide. Nothing was spared of jollity and good
will. Friends and relatives from all around called
in for the celebration, for word had been spread
that this would be the Christensens last Yule in
Denmark. If any guests were disappointed at the
absence of pipe and bowl -- too bad -- it was the
Mormon Way. There was love and friendship and
tasty food enough for everyone - and coffee too.
And there was dancing and singing and well-wishing.
Christen himself was the best of dancers,
as were the son Laurs and Elder Myrup too. If
any visitors were shocked upon seeing a Mormon
priest kick up his heels - well - too bad again!

Especially gay at that holiday time was the
daughter Maren, for she had just been spoken for
by the missionary, Lars Myrup. There were congratulations
all around. Her parents were delighted;
they could have hoped for nothing better than that
their eldest girl should wed the beloved Elder who
had brought them all into the true church. It was
agreed that their marriage should take place at
Aalborg, prior to them all leaving for Zion in the
spring. The last thing in the world the couple
wanted was a marriage in the Parish church at
Gettrup; the priest there should be cheated of that.
Lars Myrup was nearly four years Maren's senior,
she being six weeks short of seventeen while he
was lacking three months of twenty-one, but everyone
agreed they made a handsome pair. Else also
was pleased for Maren and, when they had a moment
alone together, confided in the younger girl that 
once, when she herself was seventeen, she too
dreamed of marrying a good and kind missionary.
She then told Maren about the letter Elder Myrup
had sent to Elder Hansen, nearly a year before, 
in which he had told of having his eyes set on the
eldest Christensen daughter even then. At this
the wide-eyed girl flung her arms round Else and
kissed her impetuously. Then she had known it
all along, had the sly governess; and they both
merrily together, as girls sharing
secrets sometimes do.
<span id="page-156"></span>

It was necessary for Lars Myrup to leave the
Kobber&oslash; area soon after Yuletide and return to
home in Myrupgaard, Lild Parish, in far north
Thisted Amt. There were arrangements for him
to make and the "where with" to be secured for his
marriage and emigration. He would travel first to
Aalborg to be relieved of his missionary responsibilities 
and also to sign up for emigration. 
Christen asked him if, while he was there at Branch
headquarters, he would also declare the Christensens' 
intentions of going. Then he entrusted his
future son-in-law with 170 rigsdaler to deposit in
partial payment for their passages, promising that
the balance required would be forthcoming in a few
more weeks. Before saying his goodbyes, Elder 
Myrup took his future brother-in-law, Laurs, aside
for a bit of private conversation and advice. The
burden of his words concerned marriage, as one 
might have supposed, but not his and Maren's alone
but the younger man's as well, "Why not marry
Else?" he said, "she will make someone an
excellent wife - why not you?" Laurs put in that
this might require some thinking! "The four of us
could honeymoon together on our way to Zion - 'tis
far better that you take a Danish wife along than to
have some foreigner set her trap for you in Zion",
Myrup continued.  "Ja, perhaps so" Laurs answered.
"Else is a strong girl and she could pull me across 
the plains in a handcart, if needs be - Ja, ja, there
would be some advantage to that!"  Trust Laurs to
always make a joke.  "Well, work on it", said the
Elder as they parted.

That turned out to be a rather mild winter 
compared to the previous one. The forepart of 
February, Christen senior set out in this wagon for 
Aalborg to finish paying his deposit, exchange some 
Danish rigsdaler into American money, and get the 
general lay-of-the-land there. By strict economy
Else had been able to save enough from her wages
for her to give her employer 80 rigsdaler to deposit
for her also. A couple of other new Mormon brethren 
went along with him for the same reasons.
"The Aalborg Conference Emigration List of 1866"
carried the following entries: Christen Christensen,
age 48, born Flarup, occupation farmer, nationality
Dane; Karen, 39, Kobert, wife, Dane; Lars M. C., 
<span id="page-157"></span>
18, Kobert, son, Dane; Maren, 16, Kobert, daughter, 
Dane; Pouline, 9&frac12;, Kobert, Dane; Petrine, 7,
Kobert, Dane; Nielsine, 4, Kobert, Dane. (Some
mistakes are here noted since Karen was born in
Gettrup, not "Kobert" (misspelling of Kobber&oslash;);
Maren was a few days of 17, not 16, and Pouline
was past 10&frac12;, not 9&frac12;. (It is probable that Christen,
like many fathers, could not remember the ages of
his own daughters.) The entry on the list directly
below that of the Christensens was for Else Kathrine 
Andersen, 19, born Hvidburg, spinster, Dane,
and then opposite her name, in the "deposited"
column, appeared the number 80. (We know Else
was born in Kjallerup, Hvidbjerg Parish.) In the
"deposited" column opposite Christen Christensen's
name appeared the figures 440 - 170 - 270, and
farther over under the "exchange" column appeared
the figures 800 - 19 = 819. In the 'foreign coin"
column was listed "paid 410.00". This has been
interpreted to mean that Christen Christensen
deposited 270 rigsdaler, plus the 170 previously
paid, or a total of 440 rigsdaler, for his and his
family's passage and railway tickets to "Wyoming"
(listed under the "remarks" column). 80 rigsdaler
were deposited in Else's name. Christen also
must have exchanged 819 Danish dollars for $410
in American money, and we are led to believe this
money was in gold coins. It was perhaps while
Christen was in Aalborg then that he was approached
on the subject of contributing to the "Church Immigration 
Fund". This was a fund which had previously 
been set up by the brethren in Salt Lake
City, from which needy Saints could borrow for
their emigration passage to Zion. Members with
extra means, both in Utah and in the Missions,
were asked to contribute to this fund. We have
been told that our Christen Christensen was one
of the generous ones in the Aalborg Conference,
where the emigration of the Saints was concerned.

In the meantime, in Kobber&oslash;, Laurs had
made up his mind about something, but he was
having some difficulty in knowing just how to go
about it. Since his older brother Christen had
now taken off on his own and his father was gone
for a time, he himself, being the only man of the
family about, had much to do, inside and out. He
<span id="page-158"></span>
had a mind to spend some time with the governess,
Else, but it seemed impossible to find her alone.
She had wonderful energy and was so enthusiastic
and helpful that she was in constant demand by
someone or other in the Christensen household. 
His mother, the gentle Karen, leaned on this girl
more and more, as it became apparent that she was
was going to have another little one. How could he
compete with his own mother and four sisters for
the attention of one they all depended on so much?
What chance had a lone man in a household of
women, especially where any private courting
was concerned?

Christen senior returned from Aalborg and
he too had a job for Else. He would trust it with
no one else but her, since his dear wife was then
too ill to help him. Would Else make him a special
lining for his waistcoat? This she would gladly do,
she said, and she gave no thought to the big task it
might be for it sounded simple enough in the asking.
This must be kept a secret thing, her employer
said, done after most others of the household had
gone off to bed. 'Twas the strangest hand sewing
Else had ever done. Into each small section of the
newly made vest lining was to be placed a gold coin
and sewn all around; which turned out to be a tremendous
job, When Laurs offered to help - hand 
her the coins or just anything - his father, sensing
something or other in the wind, withdrew in his
son's favor. And so at last Else and Laurs sat
there alone together, late into each night that it
took to complete the job; he, like old Midas of the
story, fingering the yellow gold and she sewing
round and round each piece as she put it in the
lining of Christen's vest. He spieled off jokes,
often one after the other, in great style, with no trouble
at all; but when he tried to talk of the things nearest
to his heart then, his tongue was tied. Else laughed
but all the time she was drawn to this handsome
young fellow with curly hair like like his father, and so
good and kind and unassuming, like his gentle
mother; yet somehow so very much like her
brother Mads withal.

Else hadn't been able to bring herself to
<span id="page-159"></span>
write her family of her anticipated emigration.
Actually she planned somehow to go home and tell
them of it - and say goodbye. As the time drew
nearer, however, she fled from the thought of it
more and more. How did one say goodbye forever?
Yet, when all was said and done, did her activities
really matter very much anymore to those in
N&oslash;rhaa? Occasionally the girl indulged herself in
moments of self-pity, but then she brushed these
aside by lifting up her voice in the songs of Zion,
or by quoting from Psalms, such as:-- "This is a
day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be
glad in it". Then she was comforted and went
bravely ahead, losing herself in the happiness
and plans of others, and in their service.

Soon after the first part of March Else had.
a letter from Mads, in which he told of Christen's
death in N&oslash;rhaa, 29 February that year (1866).
he had suffered much, wrote her surviving brother,
and he also included these statements:-- "Christen,
in his last days, was stirred to look inward into
his sinful heart and consider the Lord's goodness
to repentant sinners and whatever else there is to
believe in. Immediately afterwards, we other
brother and sisters came in touch with the same
way of life through a revival initiated by Grundtvig."
So,thought Else, they too were searching - for
the truth perhaps. But they would never find
it with Grundtvig! Then thinking again of Christen,
she couldn't help but recall the old verse:

>"When the devil is ill, a monk he would be,<br>
But when he is well, the devil is he."

Then at once she was ashamed and saddened and
went outside by herself and wept. Laurs followed
to give comfort and then they walked and talked
until they had made their way together to where
the land overlooked the water. There, in the
distance where the winter's ice had given way,
the flying shapes of ships appeared. They themselves 
would soon be sailing!

We are left to our own imaginings as to just
where and when the important words were said
between these two. This being a leap-year, she
might have helped the young man out a bit and
<span id="page-160"></span>
popped the question herself, had she known of the
custom. That Laurs M. C. and Else K. fell in
love we can be certain, and that they planned to
be wed in Aalborg in the month of April is also
true.

In anticipation of her marriage, Else now
wished for the lovely things in her brides-chest,
and even the chest itself. But the amount of
luggage allowed her on the voyage could scarcely
accommodate all the necessary things, let alone
these. Then she wrote home to her parents to tell
of her future plans -- her marriage to come and
her expected emigration to America, both to take
place within a month or so. She told them she
lacked for nothing there in Kobber&oslash; since the
family of her betrothed had taken her to their
hearts like a favored daughter of their own. She
asked that her sisters be given the things in her
brides-chest and all else of hers, between them;
she would have no room for any of these on the
ship. She offered condolence for poor Christen,
who had died a bachelor just short of twenty-seven.
She made no promise of a visit to N&oslash;rhaa to bid
them goodbye but she left the door open in hopes
her parents would invite her, should the chance
arise.

* * * * *

Christen Christensen sold his farm and
homestead in Kobber&oslash; for half its value, with the
stipulation that he and his household could remain
there until mid April, or the time of planting. He
sold the remainder of his crops and livestock as
well, with the exception of his choicest team of
horses, which he hoped to take along to Aalborg,
together with his fine carriage, and dispose of
them just before taking the ship. The rest of the
family effects they couldn't take with them they
arranged to sell or give away to relatives and
friends. Packing had been going on for some
time, in valises, bundles and boxes; and two large
trunks, for which they would have to pay an extra
shipping fee, were filled with all the family's best
wearing apparel, together with the few heirlooms
with which they were loathe to part. It was
necessary too for all adults of the family, as well
<span id="page-161"></span>
as Else, to visit the civil authorities there and
secure permission to leave Kobber&oslash; and have
the official stamp placed in each individual identification 
book. It was lucky for Laurs that his
request to leave came in peacetime, otherwise
he would have surely been denied it and put right
away in the king's army. Another few months
might have seen him in anyway, unless he had
been lucky enough to "draw a pass".

The forepart of April the Christensens spent
much time visiting their relatives and friends to
say goodbye. There were Karen's sisters, Maren
Thomsen and Ann Jensen and their families, and
Christen's brother, Jens C. Christensen, and his
three sisters, Karen, Marie and Anne, and their
families. Yes, there were a host of their relatives
all around the area, and friends galore. Many of
them expressed sorrow for them - that such a
promising family was being deceived by those
"wicked Mormons". They hoped that when they
found out their mistake they would return to "dear
old Denmark". However, some expressed fear
that the Mormons would kill them should they
attempt to get away, or that the Indians would
kill them if they stayed in this so-called "Zion".
They had heard that the redmen were on the warpath 
there now and killing the settlers right and
left. As to their near relatives, none of them
seemed inclined to listen to their testimonies of
the Restored Gospel, although they bore them at
every opportunity, but rather looked upon them as
fools because they had joined so unpopular a sect
as the "Mormons". Some of their better-off
friends and relatives rejected the gospel because
they had too much of this world's goods, others
were not religiously inclined, and still others
loved the ways of the world too much to repent
of their sins and lead better lives.

One of the last places Christen and Karen
visited was the Parish churchyard at Gettrup,
where their four babies lay buried, as well as
Karen's parents and numerous relatives. She
was especially nervous for fear the Lutheran
priest would come out and revile them or at
least forbid them to enter there; so they stayed
<span id="page-162"></span>
only briefly by the small graves and luckily saw
naught of him. They were filled with sorrow and
regret at having to leave friends and relatives, of
course, but more so at having to leave their little
ones there. Then there was their first born,
Christen. It would be hardest of all to leave him
in Denmark. They were grieved that they had been
unable to bring him into the new Church and that
they might never see him again or know his children, 
should he marry. It seemed almost like
cutting off an arm or something, to be forced to
leave part of their very own flesh and blood behind.
It was not that they were worried about him getting
on. In Denmark fourteen was considered the age
when a peasant boy could take care of himself and
only depend on his parents for good counsel and
encouragement, and Christen Jr. would be twenty
in a matter of days. He would be well taken care
of where money was concerned, for a while at least;
his father had seen to that. In this their son was
most fortunate, for some fathers gave their sons
only their names, though others may have included
a lot of advice in the bargain. But Christen had
been well taken care of all his days and had been
given all the love and consideration that caring
parents could bestow on a child. The young man
had come home for their leaving and to pick up
some things he wanted from there. He would not
consent to going with them to Aalborg for a last
parting, although his mother clung on him and wept
when she begged it. In fact, he planned to leave
Kobber&oslash; the day before they did. Bitterness
against the gospel had hardened him, even towards
his own people.

In order to leave the family free for their
visiting, Else had taken over a good part of the
responsibility at the farmhouse -- besides, she
had much to do for herself yet. Thanks to this
generous family she would be properly outfitted
for her marriage and the long journey afterwards.
Her soon-to-be father-in-law had insisted on furnishing
her with the money she needed and more;
the gentle Karen had given her linens and bedding,
including some lovely down pillows; Maren had
helped her sew things and added some of her own,
and the little girls had presented her with small
<span id="page-163"></span>
gifts and tokens. In fact, the entire family, except
the son Christen, had so showered her with proofs
of their affection that she would lack none of the
material things to take. Laurs was often hovering
about, indulging her whims and tending to her needs,
as a true lover -- it was wonderful to be a real part
of it all. But there was something none of them
could do for her; she had to make her own goodbyes.

Else was still hoping for a brief visit to her
home in N&oslash;rhaa to have a look at them all there
once again and to bid farewell; also she wished to
introduce them to her betrothed. Laurs had promised 
he would take her there, on the way to
Aalborg, should she wish it. They could leave
Kobber&oslash; a day ahead of the rest and join them the
following day along the road somewhere. Christen
and Karen in fact had urged it, saying that by all
means Else should go to see her own family before
leaving for America. Eight thousand miles or
more was a long ways away! But no word had
come from anyone in N&oslash;rhaa in answer to her
letter telling them all about her future plans, and
time was short. Three days before their scheduled
departure there was yet no word from her people
and the disappointed young lady could still make
no definite plans in regards to her home-going.
But the very next day some mail arrived. There
was a package from her sister Karen - some dainty
underthings the sweet girl had made for her. There
was only this brief word enclosed, however, -- "For
your marriage festival with love - from Karen".
There was quite a fat letter from Mads though,
and Else's fingers trembled as she tried to unfold
it, she was so eager. Mads had written that the
word of her forthcoming emigration had been a
shock to their whole family, especially coming so
close on the heels of Christen's passing. The
announcement of her planned marriage had upset
them also, especially since it was to be to a
"Mormon". Their mother, Mette, was prone on
her bed again, weeping. 'Twas enough to have
Else join the Mormons, she had said, without
having her marry one and then, on top of it all,
sail away with them across the ocean to their
strange kingdom! They at home would never
live this all down as long as they lived, or so said
<span id="page-164"></span>
their mother. Even their father seemed somewhat
stunned with it all and kept repeating over and
over, "No other Mormons shall ever set foot
inside this cottage for they have robbed me of
my daughter!" This was as Mads put it. Of
course he himself could understand, he said, that
love never asked the religion of its victims before
attacking. But why was she so set on risking her
life, as it were, on the sea, or on the great
prairies where wild animals roamed in herds, or
in the Rocky Mountains where wild Indians, with
tomahawks and arrows, were bent on killing all
intruders there? He closed by saying that her
sisters sent their love, along with his; then added,
"the older ones themselves would be most grateful
for any husbands of their own, no matter what the
variety". So Mads could still joke, thought Else,
although he should have known how terribly his
letter would disappoint and wound her.

Prayers are not always answered in the way
petitioners desire them to be, but Else's prayers
had found an answer in Mads' letter, for now she
knew she could never go home again and take Laurs
with her. Her goodbyes would have to be written.
So she started with her sister Karen, thanking her
for the pretty things she had sent and telling her of
her love and admiration for her. Then she wished
her well and bid her goodbye - "perhaps until we
meet again in another life". Then she wrote them
each in turn, saying farewell, and to Stine she
added something about Laurs, her betrothed, and
what a kind, good and patient man he was. Though
he was younger than she herself and no taller, being
about her height, yet he was curly-haired, very
manly and so handsome, besides being full of wit
and humor. To the usual love and farewell she
sent to Marie she also added the recipe for the
Christensen family's favorite dish, as well as
other cooking suggestions. Then she invited her
younger sister to come and visit her sometime
when she and Laurs became settled in the Rocky
Mountains. To Mads she wrote many things about
the gospel, bearing her testimony to him and
challenging him to seek after truth. "Each mind
has to choose between the search for truth and
repose" she told him; "one can never have both."
<span id="page-165"></span>
She herself had chosen the harder-right over the
easier-wrong and time would bring the reward.
"Come sea, come prairies, come Indians", she
wrote; "the Lord will surely protect us!" It was
most difficult writing to her parents, for her tears
kept blotting out the letters and she had to start
over again and again with - "Dear Far and Mor" - and
then she poured her heart out to them in words
of deepest affection and appreciation. She begged
their forgiveness for any disappointment or unhappiness 
she had caused them; hoping that sometime
they would understand. She asked the Lord's
choicest blessings upon their heads and promised
to pray for them, in their declining years. Then
she bid them a fond goodbye, as her tears streamed
down unwiped. "Someday", she wrote in closing,
"we shall all meet together again in a brighter
land, where love and trust prevail - were it not
so, and did I not fervently believe it, my heart
would break!" And then, as she sealed the letter
to them, it suddenly came to her in a flood of
yearning that no matter how long or far away she
should roam, her childhood home would always
call and reach out to her in voices unstilled by
time and space.

## AALBORG ... April-May 1866

Bright and early the morning of Wednesday
April 18th 1866, a farm wagon, driven by a good
natured old farmer, drew up at the Christensen
place where Christen's two-seated carriage stood
ready and waiting. The big trunks and large
baggage were soon hoisted into the wagon and
then Maren, Else and Laurs took their places
there, sitting on various rolls of bedding. They
would pick up Lars Myrup on the way. Karen,
Christen and the three young girls occupied the
carriage, together with lunch sacks, boxes, packages 
and bags. Christen, driving his sleek black
team of mares, led out into the country road and
the wagon followed. Of course they were headed
for Aalborg, the point of rendezvous for all Mormon 
Saints leaving on the next church-sponsored
voyage to America's Zion, which was between 80
<span id="page-166"></span>
and 90 American miles from Kobber&oslash;. Happiness
was reflected on every face, even the gentle
Karen's; for she was feeling much better than for
several months past. Christen was wearing his
coin lined vest under his coat, but few knew it. He
was taking no chance with the pickpockets. Sena
was still nibbling on her breakfast biscuit. The
young people in the wagon joshed along with the
old farmer who had been hired to drive them to
their destination. Pouline and Trina were all eyes,
and full of questions about everything new they saw
and far too excited to settle down. Soon Karen was
weary of them and begged Christen to stop and let
them get out and go ride in the wagon with Laurs
and Else, while Maren came into the carriage with
them, to look out for Sena. And so the two vehicles
traveled along, one following the other, past
Gettrup and the white church, on through Gundtoft,
which was close to Flarup, and then on to Ydby,
where they turned sharply into the main traveled
highway through Thy. Then they took a north-easterly 
direction paralleling the shores of the
lovely Limfjord and its bays, until they passed
near Stagstrup and on to Sundby. It was here that
Else pointed out the road that turned off west
towards her home town of N&oslash;rhaa, which was only 
about 10 kilometers (six miles) away. How simple
it would have been to turn off there and make their
way to her parents' home to rest. She turned and
gazed back, as the wagon drove on past the turn,
straining her eyes in looking as long as she could
see in the direction of N&oslash;rhaa. Laurs reached out
and patted her arm - but said nothing then.

Some six or so miles later they were in
Thisted City, which was by far the largest place
in Jutland. It was then well into the afternoon and,
although they hoped to reach Myrupgaard, in Lild
Parish, before nightfall, they stopped for a time
to rest mainly because of the weary Karen. While
she rested and Christen and the old farmer watered
and fed the horses, Laurs and Else took the three
little girls for a brief stroll through beautiful
Thisted. Maren had other things than sightseeing
to think of since at Myrupgaard, now only some
fifteen miles away, she would again greet her
sweetheart, Lars Myrup. He had arranged for
<span id="page-167"></span>
them to spend the night there with his people, it
being midway between Aalborg and Kobber&oslash;.
Afterwards they all sat together on a green bank
overlooking blue Thisted Bay in the Limfjord and
ate a lunch, watching the ships come and go in the
harbor there. There were birds flying in all
directions; none of them had ever seen so many
flying birds all at once before. Perhaps they
hadn't remembered that they were approaching
the area of Vejlerne, a fjord bay partly filled up
by sand, one of Europe's major breeding places
for wild birds. It was the mating season for
birds now too!

The area around Thisted City was more
hilly, as it was farther north, and they soon
moved into more trees as they left there for
Myrupgaard, It was fun discovering northernmost
Jutland, for one never knew what lay hidden behind
the next bend in the road or beyond the nearest
crest of hills. There was a striking and charming 
contrast between the gentle estuaries of its
east coast and the rougher scenery of its west
coast, where the Christensens had come from.
Towns and villages were spread in pockets, large
and small, some tucked away in valleys, others,
with twisted narrow streets, obstinately climbing
hillsides. In between the extremes of east and
west coasts were stretches of meadowland and
winding streams. Green routes crossed lush
undulating hills, which could give way unexpectedly
to flat, brown moorland with distant views of then,
again, to a chain of lakes. Not far to the east of
the route the Christensens were taking to Myrupgaard 
was Vikingegrave, a historic graveyard
from the Viking period of a thousand years before.
Yes, in Denmark's Thy, past, present and future
went hand in hand. This was the area that had
been their home and that they would soon be
leaving, perhaps forever.

They spent the night at Myrupgaard with
Elder Myrup's people, where Lars himself had
greeted them with joy and thanksgiving. The
following morning early the group took off towards 
Aalborg, the two happy couples, anticipating
their marriages within a few days, riding in the
<span id="page-168"></span>
wagon driven by the old farmer, while Christen,
Karen and the younger girls again occupied the
carriage. Going north a few more miles they 
soon swung almost east around Lund Fjord. Lars
Myrup pointed out that directly north a mile or so
from there was Bulbjerg, a white chalk cliff 
towering out over the Skagerrak Sea some 165 feet,
and farther out into the water another cliff,
Skarreklit. The company continued to travel on
east through hills, forest areas and many towns 
and villages, skirting lakes and streams for a good
part of the day, turning north again they crossed a
great expanse of flatland which had originally been
a great bog. Then they turned directly south
towards the Limfjord, where its waters had
narrowed to not more than the width of a large
river. Here on the north side of the lovely fjord
lay one of the largest Viking burial grounds in 
Denmark, Lindholm H&oslash;je, where the grave mounds
as usual were outlined by rocks, in the shape of
ships. Nearby was the large town of N&oslash;rresundby,
through which they drove and which was linked to
the city of Aalborg by a bridge going across the
Limfjord, south.

Crossing over the water on this pontoon 
bridge, the Christensens and their friends were
soon in Aalborg. It was the first time any of 
them, except Christen and Lars Myrup, had been
there and the largest place they had ever seen.
So here it was - the city of which they had heard
so much! Known for its numerous waterways, as
well as its antiquity, Aalborg had been a commercial
center for centuries.  Large merchants'
houses and warehouses, the house of Jens Bang
(1624) and Aalborg Castle (1539) dominated the
town center. Its industries (akvavit, cement,
tobacco) had more recently carried its name far
and wide. Rightly called a gay and friendly town,
its large parks, with many sculptures, relieved
the pattern of houses, and restaurants, theaters,
and the pleasure gardens (Tivoli-Karolinelund)
provided healthy entertainment. Other places of
interest there included the St. Budolfi (Botolph) 
Church; the Monastery of the Holy Ghost (1432);
Aalborg Museum of History and Art; the Aalborg
Hall (the biggest congress hall in Scandinavia), the

setting for the Danish Food Fair; the Zoo, with
over 1,500 animals, and the 300-foot Aalborg
Tower, for a fine view.

* * * * *

The Aalborg Branch of the LDS Church,
established there fifteen years and some months
before, 25 Nov. 1850, was now one of the best and
most active branches of the LDS Church in all of
Scandinavia. Elder Hans Jensen (Hals) of Manti,
Utah, U.S, A., was then president of the Aalborg
Branch or Conference and Elder Morten Lund of
Fountain Green, Utah, president of the adjoining
Vendsyssel Conference. These two brethren were
then in Aalborg to assist the incoming members
with their preparations and oversee the job of
emigrating the Saints from their areas. Brother
Lund himself was also preparing to return to his
home in America with the group. There would be
the sick to administer to, marriages to look after,
additional funds to secure for the more needy,
encouragement to give, besides meetings, arrangements, 
advice, and all the other numerous details
attendant to such an undertaking.

Since the Christen Christensen party from
Kobber&oslash; was among the very first to arrive in
Aalborg, the port of departure, that April of 1866,
they were immediately housed in the Saints' meeting 
hall there. As additional emigrants continued
to arrive from both Conferences the Saints' hall
proved to be far too small to accommodate them
all, so an additional larger hall was hired on
Bispensgade street where most of those from the
Vendsyssel area took up quarters, while all made
final preparation for the long journey ahead. Emigrants 
continued to arrive until there were nearly
two hundred of them. Many meetings were held in
which the necessary instructions were imparted by
the brethren who had experience in emigration
matters.

One of the first things the Christensens had
to take care of after getting temporarily settled
in Aalborg was the marriage of their son and
daughter. So three days after their arrival in
that city, it being Sunday 22 April 1866, a double
<span id="page-170"></span>
wedding ceremony was held, undoubtedly at the
Saints Meeting Hall, and Maren Christensen became 
the bride of Elder Lars C. N. Myrup, while
Laurs M. C. Christensen was wed to Else Kathrine 
Andersen. It is most likely that the president 
of the Aalborg Branch, Elder Hans Jensen, officiated
in the presence of the family, friends and members.
Else felt somewhat alone since none of her own
people were present at the wedding. In fact, none
of her relatives had ever met her intended husband,
although they might easily have, had they been
willing to extend an invitation. Else's past had
to be forced aside now - 'twas but the prologue
to a new and more exacting life ahead.  Recollections
of the bitter and sweet of it, however, would
linger with her as long as memory remained.

There were numerous other things requiring
the Christensens' attention during those four weeks
they were in Aalborg, Having their likenesses taken
by a professional photographer was an important
item on their agenda. So, attired in their best,
they went and had a daguerreotype made of their
family group, desiring to record themselves as
they were just before leaving Old Denmark. (Little
did they know then how reproductions of this photo
on tin would be treasured by their posterities more
than a hundred years hence.)  So we see them as
they posed for that family portrait in April 1866,
more than a century ago. There is Christen himself
and his son Laurs in the Sunday suits, each
with curly hair, white shirt, hand-bowed tie, and
waistcoat with an impressive watchchain marching
across it.  The gentle Karen is seated there on the
right of Christen, wearing her large fringed shawl
and bonnet tied under her chin, with a dainty white
handmade lace collar at her throat and yards and
yards of long, full skirt billowing out around her
in the latest fashion, doubtless held so by several
stiffly starched underskirts. Maren stands back
of her mother, with amber ear-drops and her hair
in a snood, looking rather solemn for a newly-wedded
bride of seventeen, hardly doing justice 
to her real charm and beauty.  Pouline and Petrine,
standing on either side of Karen, look very pretty
in their bright plaid dresses with long, ballooned
sleeves, cinchened-in waists, full long skirts and 
<span id="page-171"></span>
belts with fancy buckles, each wearing a white lace
collar like their mother's and amber ear-drops and
beads. Little Sena, in her long full-skirted, full-sleeved
costume with tight belt and round buckle,
also wears a lovely white collar, though a sort of
fichu-type one; standing between her father's knees,
where he is seated, she looks very preoccupied,
likely with the fellow who is taking the picture.
All the females, both young and old, must have
been well shod in the popular high-buttoned shoes,
even Sena, for these folks were well-to-do Jutlandic
peasants. Later the newlyweds, the four
of them together, had their pictures taken at the
same establishment; Lars Myrup and Laurs
Christensen seated and their wives, Maren and
Else, in shawls and bonnets, standing up proudly
behind them.

Extra shopping for the daily necessities and
special essentials had to be done but Christen and
the married couples took care of this and as many
of the other daily tasks as they could manage,
leaving the frail Karen free to relax and rest as
best she could under the circumstances, for she
so much needed to conserve her strength for the
more difficult days to come. Almost the complete
care of the children was assumed by them also in
order to lighten that burden for the pregnant
mother. Yes, those were busy people, those
Christensens, and Christen Christensen was a
very busy man. It is likely that the presiding
brethren in Aalborg became well acquainted with
him and his family. It is also most likely that
they counseled with him often and depended on
him for extra money to help out the great cause;
for we have been told that he not only helped pay
off the debts of the Aalborg Branch but that he
also financed the emigration of at least thirty of
the Saints at that time, besides the nine members
of his own party. And among other things, Christen
had to attend to the selling of his fine team and
carriage but likely left that until the very last in
order to have convenient transportation in and
about the city for his family.

It must have been a strange honeymoon for
the two couples, having to share quarters in the
<span id="page-172"></span>
Saints meeting hall with nearly a hundred other
people of all ages. That they were joshed and
jollied by many is easy to imagine - but that Laurs
M. C. Christensen always had a ready and witty
answer for each friendly offender is still easier to
believe. Did the four of them ever take the opportunity 
to steal away together and explore Aalborg?
Did they borrow father Christen's team and carriage
for rides through the city streets or along the shore
of the beautiful Limfjord? Or did their tastes run
to theatres, pleasure gardens, parks, museums
and the zoo? It is not likely that these honeymooners
indulged in many of the frivolities in
Aalborg. Elder Myrup must have been kept pretty
busy seeing to the problems of the emigrating converts 
he had made, besides other branch responsibilities. 
The other three must have been well
occupied with the many daily tasks pertaining to the
ordinary everyday living in the Christensen 
family - meals, washing of dishes and clothes, mending,
minding the children, etc. And there were always
long black stockings to be knit - no woman could
hardly keep ahead of that. Yes, all these things
had to go forward, along with the general preparations 
for the voyage, whether or no. These emigrant 
honeymooners from Thy were likely treated
much as ordinary people - but it must have been
fun being married and planning a new home in a
new land anyway!

* * * * *

Elder Carl Widerborg was President of the
Scandinavian Mission at that time, Since the transportation 
of Scandinavian emigrants directly from
Hamburg, Germany to New York had proved so
successful the year before, it was decided that
the same route should be taken by the emigrants
in 1866, bypassing Liverpool and other ports
enroute. So President Brigham Young Jr. and
Elder John W. Young, from the European Mission
headquarters in Liverpool, personally went to
Hamburg in late April to assist President Widerborg 
in making the necessary arrangements to
that end. By the middle of May all was in order
for the departure of the year's first company of
emigrating Saints from Scandinavia.

<span id="page-173"></span>

Wednesday, May 16, 1866, had been set for
the day of their departure from Aalborg. What a
hurry-scurry, hustle and bustle everyone was in!
How many families there were - children swarmed
all over! The ship "Dania" was riding at anchor in
the harbor awaiting their boarding, and by midday
most of them were making their way toward the
point of embarkment, marching along in groups,
singing the songs of Zion lustily, in their native
tongue. Friends and relatives of the departing
gathered to say goodbye and tearful embraces were
witnessed on all sides. Curious onlookers grouped
themselves along the shore - watching the "Mormons"; 
some probably thinking to themselves or
saying it outright, -- "Good riddance!" Bedding
rolls, bundles, bags and baggage were piled about,
ready to be loaded, and on some of them people
stretched to rest momentarily. Government
inspectors were going over everything and doctors
looked at everyone as their tickets were checked.
It took hours it seemed. Karen, pale and weak
from her ever-increasing burden, yet as gentle,
courageous and full of faith as always, was helped
along by her devoted husband, Christen, while the
newlywedded couples, with the little girls in tow,
came next in line. Someone began blowing on a
mouth organ, as they moved along, the tune to
"Come, Come Ye Saints", and a number took up
the refrain including some of the Christensens,
-- "And should we die before our journey's through,
happy day, all is well. We then are free from toil
and sorrow too, with the just we shall dwell. And
if --" everyone was hurried along and the song
ceased.

It was a great job getting everyone on board,
especially with so many children. By 4:00 o'clock
in the afternoon, nevertheless, all the emigrants
there were on the ship waiting to leave the city of
Aalborg. Some stood near the railing of the upper
deck, shouting and waving hands and handkerchiefs
shoreward in goodbyes. Else too paused there a
moment, and turned to peer anxiously and longingly
among the crowd left on shore for one familiar face
of her youth - but she recognized no one. She
wiped her eyes, and Laurs stole an arm around
her shoulder and smiled sideways at her, as her
<span id="page-174"></span>
father had been wont to do. Then he said softly,
"Is it then so bad Else?" When she made no
answer he continued, trying to cheer her, 
-- "Someday, when we have become rich and important
in Zion, they will welcome you back to Thy with
flags a-flying!" Dear, kind Laurs, thought Else
sadly; even he could not fully understand. Ja, only
those who had packed their bags and gone away
from their very own forever could know the heartbreak 
of it. So she said her own goodbyes within
herself and then, like "Ruth of Old", she looked
back no more but turned and followed her husband's
mother.

With the first shudder of the ship excitement
on board exploded and many hastened to wave goodbye 
again. It was about 5:00 o'clock late afternoon
of 16 May 1866, when the "Dania", with its happy
cargo, was finally lifted upon the breast of the
Limfjord and set sail eastward toward the Kattegat
Sea, headed for Copenhagen.

# THEIR PROMISED LAND
<span id="page-175"></span>

> They stood shoulder to shoulder in the
wilderness, far from all help, surrounded by an
overwhelming number of foes. Each day's work
was fraught with danger as they warred with the
wild forces from which they wrung their living.
Around them on every side lowered the clouds
of the impending death struggle with the savage
lords of the neighboring lands.

## WEARYING MILES WESTWARD

Among the many other Saints who had joined the Christensens and Myrups for this journey to Zion was a young Dane of some fifteen years named Andrew Jenson. He and his parents and brother came from the little city of Saeby in the Vendsyssel Conference. Andrew, fortunately, kept a day-by-day account of the trip, and to him we are indebted for a substantial part of the information included in this chapter. Brother Jenson later became Assistant Historian of the LDS Church and traveled widely in Scandinavia and elsewhere, collecting historical information for the Church. He wrote several volumes and it is from two of these, "History of the Scandinavian Mission" and "Autobiography of Andrew Jenson" that we have gleaned much about the journey of this company of Saints to Zion.

The day was fine and the sea calm and they enjoyed sailing over the broad face of the Cattegate, but as the vessel heaved, some of the emigrants experienced seasickness. At daybreak, May 17th, they passed the town of Helsinger (Elsinore) and at 6:00 o'clock a.m. arrived <span id="page-176"></span>safely in the city of Copenhagen, the Capitol of Denmark. One of the Elders led the way from the landing stage to a hall which had been rented for the purpose, and there most of the emigrants spent several hours. Some, however, were too deeply interested in the grandeur of the city to remain quietly in one place and walked all around, promenading on the ramparts, visiting the principal squares and churches and enjoying themselves immensely. This was the largest city most of the emigrants from Jutland had ever seen, Copenhagen at that time had about 180,000 inhabitants. (Now with its Suburbs, it has over a million and is considered one of the finest and best governed cities in the world.)

Here the emigrants from the Aalborg and Vendsyssel Conferences were united with emigrating Saints from the other Danish Conferences, and at 1:00 o'clock p.m. they sailed from Copenhagen on board the steamship "Aurora", which was to take them to Keil in Holstein. The voyage along the coasts of Zealand and "M&oslash;ens Klint" a hill of chalk formation which rose abruptly from the sea 450 feet. The weather was pleasant and the sea undisturbed. Joy and happiness reigned supreme on board; most of the Saints seemed delighted with the prospects before them.

Sailing along on the blue Baltic Sea the Danish emigrants soon saw the last of their "Lovely Land" with her green, green islands, for day and night drew together and dark covered all, and when the light of the morning of May 18th came they had reached "Kieler Fjord" off the coast of Holstein, Germany. Sailing up the Fjord they soon reached the city of Keil where they landed and tarried several hours in the fine waiting room at the railroad station. Here again the more venturesome took off to stretch their legs and visit different parts of this city with its beautiful parks and gardens. Keil (now an important seaport of Germany) was then an attractive city of about 30,000 inhabitants. It was situated in a fertile district of the country on a fjord, which was one of the safest harbors on the Baltic.<span id="page-177"></span>

At 12:00 o'clock noon they were all seated in railway cars and left for Altona, about seventy miles distance, where they arrived after three hours pleasant journey through the green and beautiful Holstein. This was the first railroad ride for the majority of the emigrants, railroad building having been commenced in parts of Denmark only a few years previous to 1866. From Altona they all marched down the hill to the banks of the river Elbe, where the women and children boarded a little steamer and went by water, while the men walked a mile or so through a part of Altona into the city of Hamburg where they were all lodged in an emigration house to enjoy a comfortable nights rest. Again the spark of restless Viking blood in their veins took a number on another exploration jaunt and they walked miles through the great city of Hamburg before retiring. All spoke German here, which few of the emigrants understood.

Getting everyone on and off conveyances so many times took real good managing, and it was with thanksgiving that they now faced the last of it, for a time at least. On Saturday, May 19, 1866, they went on board the double-decked packet ship "Kenilworth" (a sailing vessel with Capt. Brown in charge). This ship lay at anchor a short distance from the dock in the river Elbe. This was an old English sailing vessel which had been chartered by the Church on easy terms. It was ordinarily used for hauling coal, etc. and was not intended for passenger traffic. But it had been fitted up on this occasion with bunks and other conveniences on both decks for the comfort of the passengers. At the time steamships were in common use for ocean travel but the cost to emigrants for such luxury was prohibitive, so this sailing vessel had been engaged.

The next day, which was Whitsunday (May 20th) was spent in locating the emigrants in different parts of the ship and showing each family its bunk. From their anchorage in the Elbe they had a fine view of the surroundings, the cities of Hamburg and Altona on the north and the low and flat country (Hannover) on the south. On the 21st <span id="page-178"></span>a meeting was held on the middle deck of the ship where the Elders in charge gave instructions in regards to cleanliness, order and decorum. On Tuesday, May 22, more emigrants, together with Elders Carl Winderborg, Niels  Wilhelmsen, Geo. M. Brown and Christian Christiansen, arrived in Hamburg and were taken on board. This increased the number of emigrants on the Kenilworth to 684 souls, besides the ship's crew; of these 583 were from Denmark, 23 from Norway, 73 from Sweden and 5 from Germany.

The next day (May 23rd) the Kenilworth left her moorings and was towed by two small tugs a short distance below Altona (where other supplies were taken on, including barrels of fresh water). On the 24th President Carl Winderborg and Elders Wilhelmsen and Christiansen came on board and organized the company for traveling, appointing Samuel L. Sprague as president or leader with Morten Lund as his assistant. Fred R.E. Berthelsen was appointed secretary and Ole H. Berg captain of the guard. The emigrants were divided into 42 messes or districts containing from twelve to seventeen persons apiece, with a president over each whose duty it was to receive provisions and distribute them to the various families and individuals in his district; also to preside over prayers night and morning for his respective group as well as watch over each of those under his jurisdiction and see that all rules of cleanliness and order, etc., were strictly obeyed. (We can easily imagine that it was Elder Lars Myrup who would have been placed in charge of the group which included the Christensens from Kobberod.) On the same occassion the ship was dedicated by President Carl Winderborg and the prediction made that it should carry its precious cargo of souls safe and well to the "Land of Promise". Timely and valuable instructions were imparted by the bretheren and the emigrants were enjoined to yield strict obedience to the brethern who had been appointed to preside.

On Friday, May 25, 1866, a little after noon, the ships anchor was lifted and the Kenilworth was towed down the river Elbe and at 9:00 P.M. sailed past cuxhaven at it's mouth and was soon far out<span id="page-179"></span> on the broad face of the North Sea. The weather was pleasant, the sea quiet, and the commencement of the voyage promising. Most of the Saintson board were in high spirits. (Two other companies of Saints from the Scandinavian countries sailed from Hamburg a few days later, in the ships "Humbolt" and "Cavour", making the total number of emigrants from the Scandinavian Mission 1,213 in 1866.)

Saturday, 26 May, the wind was favorable and the old ship sped on her way swiftly. Some passengers engaged in dancing on the upper deck. The route was to be north around Scotland for although this was a longer way than the usual route through the English Channel which most emigrant ships leaving continental Europe chose yet it made it possible to avoid any excessive heat. On Monday 28 May heavy winds arose on the North Sea and drove them off their course far to the eastward and so close to the west coast of Norway that its rocky cliffs could be plainly seen, They encountered several showers of hail in this area. Due to the tossing and rocking of the vessel in the strong winds most of the passengers suffered more or less from seasickness. In the afternoon of June lst, having gotten back on her course, the ship passed the Shetland and Orkney Islands lying north of Scotland and before night were on the somewhat turbulent waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The winds had turned favorable again, however, and there was comparatively smooth sailing for about two weeks.

By this time most of the emigrants had gotten used to life on the ocean waves. They were well organized and willingly submitted to the discipline and regulations which had been agreed upon. Thus at 6:00 o'clock each morning they arose at the signal of the bugle, attended to absolutions and then engaged in prayer in the different districts at 8:00 o'clock. Then they ate breakfast, which consisted of tea and rye bread in the beginning but after all the bread had been consumed they feasted on sea biscuits which were made of rye, wheat and oatmeal. Their food was prepared and cooked in a large kitchen from which it was<span id="page-180"></span> brought and distributed by the various group presidents in charge. At 11:30 A.M. they had dinner, which generally consisted of good, solid food. After that they frequently amused themselves in dancing or engaged in diverse games on the upper deck in order to keep up good cheer and counteract the tediousness of the long voyage. Thus the days for most passed quickly and pleasantly. At 6:00 P.M. they had supper and at 9:00 o'clock they were supposed to retire for the night after having had prayers at 8:00 o'clock. Cleanliness and order were strictly observed and all who were able to do so were required to spend a good part of their time on the upper deck to enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Meetings were usually held on Sundays and other occasions, at which powerful testimonies were borne and timely instructions given as circumstances demanded. A number of marriages were solemnized on which occasions they generally indulged in pleasantries, dancing and speechmaking. Even a manuscript paper was issued almost daily, which introduced humorous and spicy articles suitable for the life they led.

Guard was kept up all night and all the brethren who were of proper age and able took turns. The captain and the crew were gentlemanly in their deportment towards the passengers and treated them in a kind and respectful manner, allowing them all the privileges that could reasonably be expected, and the sick received very good attention. However, although the food and provisions were satisfactory enough, the passengers had difficulty with the cook, a hot-headed and disagreeable person who quarrelled with several of the brethren, especially on one occasion when a fight was barely averted.

Likely much of the conversation those days on board was about the "Restored Church" and the "Land of Zion" for these sincere people must have felt it a wonderful blessing that the true Church of Christ, which had been lost because of the wickedness of men, had been brought back to the earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith in their day. And here they were, many of them after years of yearning, planning and scrimping, going to Zion and the<span id="page-181"></span>Rocky Mountains which, the good Lord willing, they would all see before that year's ending. Could we have listened in and interpreted the Scandinavian tongue we might have heard something like this:--"Those plates of gold, dug up from a hillside in America, told of old times there just like the old stories written on runic stones in Denmark."--"Ja, ja, I saw such a stone once, a peasant ran into it after a rain when he was plowing a field."--"America seems very new to us but it is as old as the world."--"Ja, the Book of Mormon itself tells the story of the red Indians who lived there long before Columbus sailed the seas, and about their religion and their ways, just as we have learned about Denmark and the Vikings in old times."--"There are still Indians in Zion now and on the warpath they say. 'Tis a sure thing we'll see some before we're through!"--"Joseph Smith, the Prophet himself, shot in a prison, tumbling through a window to die bravely lying at the base of it in a pool of his own blood."--"Nej, the Prophet Joseph is not really dead, any more than Christ is; though he was murdered, his spirit seemed to come alive again in the carpenter and Prophet Brigham Young whom, if we are lucky, we shall all see in Zion."--"Ja, Brigham Young was the one who led the Saints far from the persecutions of their enemies across deserts and mountains, the same way we will go to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake where the Saints are building a great city of their own."--"Ja, ja, and not only one valley but many,why all of Denmark could beset down in the middle of that place they have there and not be even noticed!" And so the talk must have gone for, once they were caught up in the spirit and wonder of the Gospel, they could go on and on just like the Restored Church had gone on even after its Prophet had been murdered. And surely none of those faithful Saints doubted but that in America, whose deserts were to blossom as the rose, they themselves would find their "Promised Land"!

<span id="page-182"></span>
Meanwhile, the Christensen family was in real trouble, the gentle Karen being very sick. Frail and ailing at the beginning of the voyage, and carrying her eleventh child, the heavy lurching and pitching of the ship, as each new storm was encountered, upset her more and more until she was forced to take to her bed and stay there. It was no ordinary seasickness that she had, although a calmer sea seemed to soothe her somewhat. Day after day she lay in her bunk unable to retain any of the little nourishment she could bear to swallow, until she grew so pale and weak all who saw her were alarmed. The ship's doctor was summoned, as fear of cholera and other contagion was always present, but he found nothing of that sort to be alarmed at, only the rebellion of the general processes of her weakened body. He did what he could to ease and comfort her. The Captain and the crew were as helpful as they could be, for the Christensens were much respected on board. Even the quarrelsome cook sent up morsels to tempt Karen's appetite - but to no avail. It was felt that if she could just hold out until they reached port, where she could rest from the sea's motion and get plenty of fresh air and fresh milk again, she would have a fair chance of recovery.

It became necessary for someone to be by Karen most of the time. In order to free Christen and his older children, as well as Else for this responsibility, a kindly emigrant sister, Anne Jensen, was hired to look after the three young girls a great deal of the time. Anne was a twenty-eight year old spinster from Vaar, Hjorring Amt, in the Vendsyssel Conference and had been baptised into the Church in Feb, 1861. Like Else, she was emigrating without her own family members and gladly took over the care of Pouline, now eleven, Petrine, age seven, and little Sena (Nielsine) who had her fourth birthday enroute, 15 June, which must have passed by mostly unnoticed because of the deep concern of all for her mother's welfare.

It was about this time, the middie of June, that the weather changed abruptly and became cold and stormy so that the Kenilworth was forced to slow down and made poor progress. Then all<span id="page-182a"></span>

<span id="page-183"></span>became enveloped in a dense fog and Captain Brown turned to a more southerly course in order to steer clear of the danger from icebergs. The weather grew worse and continued bad. The heavy fog was accompanied by continuous headwinds and the sea became angry and often sent the ship careening back and forth in a frightening manner.

As the weather worsened, Karen grew worse also as well as weaker. Laurs Myrup and the other Elders administered to the prostrate woman time and time again; but though they blessed her, they made no promise of her recovery. Christen sat by his wife's bedside in misery at her suffering and Laurs, Maren and others hovered near, but it was the capable Else who cared for the courageous and patient woman's needs, and it was Christen and Else she clung to in her most fearful moments. Karen seemed aware at times that she was slipping away, and begged to live - to reach the "Land of Zion" - to raise her young daughters - to see her son Christen again. Occasionally she called for her little girls to be near her, but when allowed, they went away frightened and tearful at the sight of her woeful face. Sometimes, in her delirium, she became as wild as the storm-tossed sea and called upon heaven to save them all from a watery grave.

In Andrew Jenson's personal manuscript history appeared this brief account of Karen's death:--"Saturday 23 June 1866 - A regular windstorm prevailed from the west. The wife of Christen Christensen died and was buried at sea with much solemnity. (Mrs. Christensen had been in delicate health for some months and the long voyage was too strenuous for her.)" In his published autobiography we find this entry (page 14):--"The death of Sister Christensen called forth much sympathy, as she and her husband had been most liberal with their means in assisting their poor co-religionists to emigrate." From writings of a granddaughter of Karen, Elsie C. Bartholomew, we find a little about her burial, quote: "Her burial at sea, the same day as her death, was performed as was the custom of such in those days. Her corpse was sewed into a canvas sack<span id="page-184"></span>into which were also placed scissors and other things thought needful for use in the delivery of her expected child. All was fastened to a large plank, with heavy weights at one end, and then pushed overboard into the troubled sea. So the faithful, loving mother, the gentle Karen, or "Carrie" as she had been affectionately called by her now bereaved husband, never reached the "Land of Zion" with her beloved family; but who can doubt but that she went to a far better place, Heaven, the dearest land of all. Her grieving family must have been comforted somewhat by the many marks of affection, sympathy and respect shown them by their friends and fellow voyagers. Not the least of those to mourn was the daughter-in-law, Else K. The gentle Karen had become so dear to her that to be thus parted from her was like losing a second mother.

There were, continuous headwinds and fogginess for five weeks in all, which made the voyage both long and dreary. Many storms were encountered and little progress made during that period. On June 26th they encountered a terrific thunder
and rain storm, on which occasion all the sails of the ship were taken down in double quick time and the good old ship reeled like a drunken man, causing much alarm among the passengers. It was not until the 5th of July that the fog lifted and then it was found that instead of being near the American shore, as had been expected, they were still far out in the Atlantic Ocean. A number of other deaths took place on the voyage, half of them during that time of wind and fog. We quote again from Andrew Jenson:--"The sad part of our voyage centered around a number of deaths which occurred. The following is a list of those of our company who found a watery grave: On May 24th a child; on May 29th Hulda Rosengren, 9 &frac12 years old and Wilhelmina Berthelsen, 37 years old; on June 2nd a child from the Aarhus Conference; on June 15th Oliver B. Rosengren, an infant; on June 19th Ole Christensen's child from Vendsyssel Conference; on June 23rd the wife of Chr. Christensen of the Aalborg Conference; on June 25th a young man from the Vendsyssel Conference; on June 27th another child; on July 3rd Christian Beck's child<span id="page-185"></span>from the Aalborg Conference; on July 6th Inger S. Petersen, 6 years old; on July 12th Sarah Larsen, an infant; on July 13th Dorthea Beck, a child from the Copenhagen Conference; and on July 15th a young man who committed suicide by jumping overboard."

"During the voyage two children were born, the first on May 26th and the second on May 29th when Niels Hansen's wife, from the Vendsyssel Conference, gave birth to a child which was named Kenilworth Brown in honor of the vessel and its
captain. Records of seven marriages which took place on board were also made."

On Sunday, July 15th, which was a beautiful sunny day, a number of coast vessels were seen in all directions and joy and animation prevailed among the emigrants. A meeting was held at 8 a.m, at which timely instructions were given
the emigrants as to their conduct upon landing in New York. About noon some of the officers looking through their spy glasses said that land was visible to the northwest, but it was not until 6 p.m, that one of the brethren, looking through his glasses, called out with a loud voice, "Land, land", and soon the green and beautiful coast of Long Island could be seen on the right by everybody. Perhaps only those who for weeks and months have been tossed about on the stormy face of the ocean can appreciate the pleasure of seeing terra firma again. The emigrants, who for about two months had been confined to the decks and berths of Old Kenilworth, appreciated to the fullest extent the change of vision that they enjoyed on that memorable day. The drooping spirits of all were revived and the desire to live in hopes of a happy future was manifested universally among the emigrants. They thanked God for bringing them safely to the shores of America. Some wept with joy. The men shaved, cut their hair, and cleaned up on general principles, while the women began to look for their best dresses in which to attire themselves when the happy privilege of landing should be enjoyed. To the Latter-day Saints the first sight of America had more than usual significance as this was the "land of <span id="page-186"></span>promise", the land of Joseph, about which they had spoken, dreamed and sung for many years before beholding it.

About the time they began to see land one of the passengers, a young and foolish man, willfully jumped overboard and was drowned. The ship was hurridly turned around, a boat lowered, and a number of sailors manning it endeavored to save him but did not succeed; he sank in the billows to rise no more until the resurrection. It was stated by his friends that he had been induced to emigrate contrary to his wishes and had repeatedly declared that he would never see America, and so it was. While the rest were eagerly looking for land, he resolutely committed suicide by jumping overboard. The "Kenilworth" passed Sandy Hook after dark and about midnight cast anchor off Staten Island at the entrance of the harbor of New York.

The next morning (July 16th) most of the passengers arose early to look at the country. "How beautiful", nearly all exclaimed when they emerged from their quarters on the lower decks and saw the green hills of Staten Island and the tall
steeples and magnificent buildings of the cities of New York and Brooklyn in the distance, The pleasant morning breeze wafted the pleasing odor of vegetation and flowers out to them. About 11 a.m, a doctor came on board to ascertain if there were any contagious diseases among the emigrants or any other disorder or sickness which might prevent them from landing, but there were none. Consequently, the anchor was lifted and they sailed into the harbor and anchored a short distance off the City of New York, almost opposite Castle Gardens, (Castle Gardens was a high building similar to a theatre, built by the American government for the use and protection of emigrants from the city sharkers, It was a beautiful place.) As the sun rose higher the day became very hot and some of the passengers were taken sick with the heat. From their point of anchorage they had a fine view of New York, Brooklyn, Jersey City, and the string of villages and towns lining the shores of New York Bay. They remained on board all day suffering from the heat, Elders Thomas Taylor<span id="page-187"></span>and William Folsom (emigration agents for the Church) came on board to arrange for their landing next day.

Shortly before noon on July 17th they took leave of the "Kenilworth" and boarded a small steamer which took them to Castle Gardens. While taking this short trip the heat was very oppressive and one of their number died. Others were so overcome by the heat that they were carried on shore more dead than alive; but, being placed in cool, airy rooms at Castle Gardens and receiving some medical treatment, they all recovered. They had spent 58 days on board the Kenilworth; 52 days since they sailed from Hamborg and 46 days since they first reached the Atlantic Ocean. Other than the few deaths, no serious accidents had happened to them during their long voyage and they realized that the predictions made by President Winderborg, to the effect that they should pass safely over the great deep, had been fulfilled. At Castle Gardens they passed through the usual examinations and scrutiny, including the enrollment of names, ages, nationality, etc.; after which they enjoyed a few hours rest in the large, airy rooms of the Gardens.*****

Elder Thomas Taylor, emigration agent for the Church in 1866, had experienced much trouble in making the necessary arrangements for transporting the emigrants from New York to the point where they were to meet the church teams at
Wyoming, Nebraska. The railroad companies whose lines went out from New York had apparently planned to speculate at the expense of the "Mormons", and had arbitrarily broken the contract previously made by the Church agent, by adding
to the price agreed upon for taking the emigrants westward. The price was unusually high and Elder Taylor knew that the emigrants were not able to pay that extra fare. At length, after having made a special trip to Boston, Mass., he succeeded in closing a satisfactory contract for their conveyance with a railroad company whose terminal was New Haven, Conn. This was an entirely new route and several hundred miles longer than that taken by<span id="page-188"></span>earlier emigrants west, but turned out to be much cheaper than the regular route had been. Thus at 9 p.m, the company left Castle Gardens and marched through a part of New York City to a point on the East River, where they went on board
a large steamship which had been chartered to take them to the proposed railroad terminal in NewH aven, Conn. The night was spent sailing up East River and Long Island Sound when, after a comparatively short but unpleasant voyage of 80 miles, they arrived at New Haven at 5 a.m, July 18th. From the landing place they walked a short distance to the railroad station where they waited about twohou rs for their train to arrive. Here it was discovered that in the turmoil of changing routes and baggage, the Christensen's two large trunks, containing most of their good clothes, best linens, keepsakes and treasures, had been lost - or stolen. There was nothing they could do about it.

When the train rolled in about 8 a.m, they boarded the cars and left New Haven, starting northward on their first railroad ride in America. Their route led through the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, and they enjoyed the beautiful scenery very much. To those Danes who had come from a low, flat country, where the highest elevation was less than 600 feet above sea level, the green mountains of Vermont and other elevated points along their route appeared grand and majestic. They traveled in 2nd class cars with comfortable seats, all night and part of the next day. Crossing the St. Lawrence River on the great Victorian Bridge they arrived in Montreal, Canada, early in the afternoon of July 19th. Montreal in 1866 had about 50,000 inhabitants. (At present it is well over a million.) Here they changed cars. The new train placed at their disposal here consisted of a few second-class passenger cars and a number of baggage cars - even some cattle cars were among them, which upon examination were found to be dirty and abominable. Their leaders were informed that they would either have to occupy these cars or wait at least two days for better accommodations, and so they concluded to submit to the inevitable. The dirty cars were swept and cleaned out as much as possible so that they could<span id="page-189"></span>be occupied, after a fashion. Seated on their bedding or trunks and boxes, they rolled out of Montreal about 7 p.m., traveling westward along the St. Lawrence River.

It took them two days to travel through Canada this way as they met with an accident on the shores of Lake Ontario where, owing to the poor condition of the railroad bed, some of the cars jumped the track and several nearly toppled
over. This accident happened during the night, and in the morning when they beheld their situation they truly felt thankful for having been saved from a terrible disaster. Their train was broken into three sections on the bank of the lake. Had any of the cars tipped over they would probably have rolled down the steep embankment into the water. As it was the track was torn up for several rods. In the afternoon, the railroad men having repaired the damage, they continued their journey and at 7 p.m. arrived in Toronto.

The next day in the afternoon of July 22nd (which happened to be the nineteenth birthday of the emigrant Laurs M. C. Christensen), they arrived at the railroad terminus on the St. Clair River, which separated Canada from the United States and its State of Michigan. A steam ferry boat took them over the river to Fort Huron in Michigan, where they spent the following night in a large freight building at the railroad station. The following day (Monday July 23rd) at 1 p.m., seated in good comfortable cars which they surely appreciated after their experiences in the Canadian baggage cars, they left Fort Huron and traveled westward through the State of Michigan, arriving in Chicago, Ill., that evening late and remained in the cars until morning.

Tuesday 24 July, at 10 a.m., another train was placed at their disposal on which they traveled through the state of Illinois, traveling the remainder of that day and the next and arriving at Quincy on the Mississippi River the morning of July 26th. There a ferry boat took them over the river to the state of Missouri, where they waited in the forest on the bank of the river until 3 p.m. The weather being very warm, a number of them took <span id="page-190"></span>advantage of the opportunity to bathe in the river, which they thoroughly enjoyed; but a young man of their company who, being a good swimmer, ventured too far out in the swift river and was carried away by the current and drowned. At 4 p.m. they continued their journey through the state of Missouri, the land where the Saints in the early days of the church suffered so much persecution. In several of the larger towns through which they passed the people acted very hostile
towards them and made several demonstrations in the shape of insults and threats. The telegraph had of course, previous to their arrival, brought the news of a company of "Mormons" coming, and thus the rough element had time to gather at the different railroad stations to give them their attention when they arrived, and "show their respects". At various stations the "welcoming committees" were dressed as Indians in war paint and feathers who, brandishing hatchets and knives, shouted oaths at them and gestured meanacingly. Although the majority of the emigrants could not understand a fragment of the language of these ruffians, yet they had little difficulty in interpreting their fierce gesticulations and grimaces as they, being urged on by the hilarious approval of the ribald crowds, outdid themselves in giving all too realistic and nerve-wracking performances. Some of the worst men in the crowds conveyed the idea, by their appearance and actions, that they would like to have treated them as they did their Prophet and co-religionist years before. The engineer of their train also appeared to be a bitter enemy. In stopping and starting the train and in quickening and lessening the speed he treated them to such jerks and violent shocks as ordinarily are experienced only on freight trains. Fortunately none of them were seriously hurt by those unpleasant and unnecessary experiences, but some of their more delicate women were threatened with nervous breakdowns.

The dawn of Friday, July 27th, found them traveling through the western part of Missouri, after having traveled by jerks and shakings all night during which the engine broke down and they<span id="page-191"></span>were delayed several hours. The supposition was that the wicked engineer, in his endeavor to make it as unpleasant as possible for them, had over-taxed his engine and broken it before he could use up its passengers. Nevertheless they arrived at St. Joseph, on the banks of the Missouri River, early in the afternoon, safe and well; and thus terminated their railroad travel, which had lasted ten days and covered a distance of about 1,700 miles. The round-about way they took through Canada cost $5.00 less for each adult passenger than any other route. On their arrival at St. Joseph they were given only one hour in which to procure provisions for a two-day trip up the Missouri River to Wyoming, Nebraska. They boarded the steamboat "Denver" and left St. Joseph at 5 p.m. The following night was a sleepless one for most of them. In the first place the weather was too sultry for anybody to rest, no place could be found for anyone to make their beds, and in addition, officers and crew of the boat seemed to be regular demons who endeavored to annoy and vex them in every possible way. The next day, July 28th, the steamboat pulled slowly up the muddy Missouri River. The day being extremely hot they were not able to venture out from the coverings of the boat for fear of being sunstruck.

On Sunday, July 29th, they arrived safe and well af the landing below Wyoming, Nebraska, which village was the outfitting place for the Saints crossing the plains that year. Here at this village they could breathe the air of freedom more freely than upon any previous occasion since they commenced their long journey. Both on shipboard and in the railway cars they had been confined to narrow quarters, but here on the grassy hill near Wyoming they could spread out and inhale the fresh air and drink the pure spring water as it gushed from the hillside. (This was the forty-ninth birthday of the recently bereft widower Christen Christensen, lately of Kobberod in Jutland.) Later some of their company were taken sick with fever, a few very seriously. Some of this sickness came upon the sufferers through disobeying the counsel of the brethren in charge, who had advised the <span id="page-192"></span>emigrants not to drink too freely of the ice cold water issuing from the springs but rather use the river water after it had been filtered. At least five of their company died the first week there, three from the Vendsyssel, one from the Aalborg and an old lady from the Copenhagen conference.

On Monday, July 30th, their baggage arrived at the Wyoming landing and was partly carried by hand and partly by teams to the campground on the top of the hill, where they were permitted to pitch their tents on any of the unoccupied land lying adjacent to the village. Those of the emigrants who had no tents made themselves temporary shelters of brush and branches cut from trees in the neighboring woods. While enjoying these conveniences they spent several days busily engaged in washing clothes and otherwise preparing for their journey across the plains. On receiving their baggage at Wyoming they found that many of the boxes had been opened and robbed of their contents, and thus some of the emigrants lost all their clothes and traveling outfits. While there they could draw provisions from the church storehouse which had been erected on the campground.

Several of the Church trains sent from the "Valley" that year after the poor were encamped near Wyoming when this company of emigrantsarrived, and had waited for them several days. Between four and five hundred wagons, with three or four yoke of oxen to each wagon, were sent that year by the Church to the Missouri River after emigrants, most of whom came expecting to cross the plains with church teams. While the emigrants were encamped near Wyoming, that little village assumed an air of importance augmented by the camps of tents and family boweries occupied by those Scandinavian pilgrims. This was not the first company of Scandinavian Saints that had camped there that year, but several companies of British emigrants had preceeded them and were already well out on the plains when they arrived. In fact, the total number of emigrating Saints from Europe in 1866 was 3,327, of whom 1,213 were from the Scandinavian countries. All these <span id="page-193"></span>companies came by way of Wyoming and most of them crossed the plains with church teams.

On Wednesday, August 1st, another company of Scandinavian emigrants, consisting of about 300 souls, arrived in Wyoming. These were the ones who had sailed on the ship "Humboldt" from Hamburg, Germany on June 2nd. The following day,
August 2nd, some of the "Kenilworth emigrants" commenced their journey across the plains from Wyoming in Capt. Joseph S. Rawlin's train. Aug. 4th another group headed westward with Peter Nebeker's church train. On Aug. 5th another group, who were going with Capt. Andrew H. Scott's train, moved their things to where the church teams were camped near the church store and were assigned their wagons. George M. Brown, who had been in charge of the Saints on the "Humboldt", was appointed spiritual leader of this large group of British, Norwegian and Danish emigrants who were to travel in 46 wagons, young Andrew Jenson and his family being among them. It was the intention that this company
should roll out of Wyoming on Aug. 7th, but a terrible rain storm, accompanied by thunder and lightning such as none of those from Scandinavia had ever experienced, visited the area. The rain poured down in torrents nearly all that day and the following night until the ground was thoroughly soaked with the downpour. While the storm was at its worst the whole village seemed to be a perfect lake. (Such storms occurred frequently in this locality in July and August each year.) The day after this deluge, Aug. 8th 1866, Capt. Scott's ox train left Wyoming to cross the plains.

With the departure of this company the village of Wyoming was almost reduced to its usual limited number of inhabitants, with the exception of a few Scandinavian emigrants and Elders who were waiting for the seasons last company of
emigrating Saints to arrive from the east. Capt. Abner Lowry's church train of ox teams had been, kept back to bring this company and the remaining Saints across the plains. This ox train was known as the Sanpete train, as most of the men and teams in it were from Sanpete Valley in central Utah.

<span id="page-194"></span>Among the waiting Saints were a number from Jutland, Denmark, including Christen Christensen and his family and some others to whom he had given financial assistance; Elder Lars Myrup (Maren's husband); Sister Anne Jensen, who had
helped with the Christensen children since their mother's illness and death on the ocean; Christian Peter Lund, his wife and young family from Sonderhaa; a few returning Elders to whom brother Christensen had loaned funds, and Elder Morten Lund, former president of the Vendsyssel Conference who was returning to his home in Fountain Green, Sanpete Co., Utah. Christen Christensen and his party, having lost their large trunks of clothing enroute, were obliged to purchase more of the necessities at Wyoming. Here, among other things, Christen bought three cooking-stoves, one for himself and one each for his two married children. Little by little his reserve was being exhausted and it must
have now been necessary for him to fall back on the gold pieces in the lining of his vest. He had come to depend on the spinster Anne Jensen to a great extent by now, in the absence of his dear wife Karen, until she had grown to seem like a regular member of his family. Anne herself had become very fond of Christen and the little girls and they of her. All, however, were very weary and anxious to be on their way. It was just short of four months since the Christensens had left their home in Thy.

The Norwegian ship "Cavour", for whose company they were waiting there had been long delayed on account of headwinds, calm and fog, notwithstanding the vessel had taken the shorter route by way of the English Channel. It was July 31st before the ship arrived at New York. The "Cavour" emigrants were at once conveyed over the same route as the one previously taken by the "Kenilworth" company. The dreaded disease cholera, having already broken out on shipboard in brother L. Larsen's family (most of whom died later on the trip), raged fiercely among the group as they traveled by railroad towards the west, claiming its victims one by one. The rough treatment these <span id="page-195"></span>emigrants received was in part responsible for the heavy death rate. Just before their train arrived in St. Joseph, Missouri, one of the passenger cars took fire and it was with great exertion that the sick were removed from it to escape being burned to death. At St. Joseph a number of the sick and dying had to be left in the hands of wicked people. Their friends obtained no further knowledge as to their fate, and never learned whether they were buried alive or killed by force, for the people with whom they were left were so hateful that they seemingly thirsted for the blood of the Saints. On the voyage by steamer up the Missouri River, nine of the remaining emigrants died, four of them being buried in the river one night and five the next. This poor reduced "Cavour" company finally arrived at the landing near Wyoming on Aug. 11th 1866.

When these emigrants were taken into camp at Wyoming, sick and weary, there was little time for them to rest. Capt. Abner Lowry's train of Church teams had already waited long for their arrival and it was now so late in the season that the start across the plains could be postponed no longer if they hoped to get across the mountains that year. Consequently, this cholera-infested company had to get ready in the greatest haste for the long and tedious journey. Two days after their arrival at Wyoming, on Aug, 13th, these emigrants left there, together with the Christensens and others who had been waiting for them. Thus one of the most pitiable treks of any of the Mormon Pioneer companies began. This was the tenth and last Pioneer company to cross the plains that year.

As had been the case with the other Church trains, the emigrants had been assigned to their wagons, ten or twelve persons to each wagon, and moved their effects thereon. There were about sixty ox-teams in all in charge of Capt. Abner
Lowry. (This was the last year that emigrants traveled all the way from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City with ox-teams, as the Union Pacific Railroad was being built from Omaha westward and the following year (1867) was opened for <span id="page-196"></span>several hundred miles west of that river.) It was a sight for those who weren't used to it to see the teamsters driving long strings of three or four yoke of oxen to each heavily loaded wagon, without reins or harnesses, using only long whips and the three words, "Gee" "Haw" and "Whoa" (which the oxen, through serious lessons had learned to understand).

## TRAGEDY ON THE PLAINS

The teams pulled out slowly, traveling a few miles out on the prairie, and encamped the first night on the brow of a hill. A meeting was held at which they were more fully organized for traveling and the necessary officers of tens and fifties appointed, as well as interpreters for the Scandinavians.  Next day they traveled westward until nearly noon and then stopped for several hours while provisions were distributed to the passengers for the first time. The rations allowed consisted of 14 pounds of flour and one pound of bacon each day for each adult, besides sugar, molasses, dried fruit and other eatables, all of which they were to prepare and cook themselves to suit their respective tastes. Having never done the like before, some of the emigrants found the baking of bread and cooking of meals in the open air a difficult task; but after a few days practice, most of them learned and life on the plains soon became rather natural, especially for those who were young and hearty. To the older members of the company, and those who had large families of children, the case was usually quite different however. The task of walking as much as possible was enjoined upon every young and able-bodied person, in order to lighten the burden of the animals. Only the old, weak and sickly were privileged to ride to any great extent, and there were plenty of those in this ill-fated company. At
noon and night, when camping, was their busiest time. First, they pitched their tents, gathered fuel and fetched water, then they made fires, baked bread, cooked other food, and finally ate their meals around the campfires, sitting on the grass or rocks. Wood was sometimes very scarce along the way and <span id="page-197"></span>in such cases they resorted to the use of dry manure, or "buffalo chips" as this was called. Frequently they had to tramp long distances to 
get water and sometimes they had to make "dry camp" where there was no water. Often they had to cook their meals while the rain poured down in torrents and drenched them to the skin and put out their fires. At other times the wind blew so hard, lifting up the loose soil and enveloping all in a cloud of dust, that their tents fell and their food was spiced with sand. For these Scandinavians from the land of short distances, this was indeed a new life and at times their energies and patience were taxed to the utmost. They had to learn that there were unavoidable difficulties in crossing the plains; besides, many of them had much more serious things to grieve them for there were many sick and dying among them.

In making their camp the usual "Mormon" method of forming two half-circles with the wagons was observed, so that a corral was made into which the oxen would be driven to be caught and yoked up anew each morning. Their tents were pitched outside the enclosure, each tent opposite the wagon to which it belonged. The oxen and such loose stock as they had were herded during the night by special herdsmen who had been brought along for that purpose, but the regular night watch in the camp was taken in turn by the emigrating brethren. Public prayer was offered in camp every night, in which everybody was supposed to participate. After the prayer, the Captain or some other leader generally made remarks of an encouraging and instructive nature, the essence of which was translated into Danish for the benefit of those who didn't yet understand English.

Thus the Abner Lowry Pioneer Company traveled from Wyoming, across the prairies of Nebraska, in a northwesterly direction to the Platte River, following the so-called Oregon Trail by way of Fort Kearney to a point near Fort McPherson. From thence they crossed the highland from the South Platte to the North Platte, reaching the latter stream at the mouth of Ash Hollow. From here they went along the North <span id="page-198"></span>Platte by way of Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff until they reached Fort Laramie. Leaving that Fort they crossed hills and streams until they came to the mouth of Deer Creek, a tributary of the Platte, traveling westward from there to the upper crossing of the Platte, where the Mormon Pioneers of 1847 had built a ferry near the site of the present city of Casper, Wyoming. They crossed the river on a bridge which stood near the old ferry and continued on in a northwesterly direction past Independence Rock and Devils Gate, then followed the Sweetwater River about seventy miles to the Continental Divide. Near this point they left the Oregon Trail and took the Mormon Pioneer trail, until they came to what was known as the "Three Crossings of the Sweetwater".

At several points on the journey they had come in contact with Indians, most of them friendly contrary to what the emigrants had expected. They saw only a few buffalos, for many of these noble animals had been wantonly destroyed by white hunters, thus wasting the food of the Indians, which had made the red men very angry. But while the Sioux Indians and other tribes showed hostilities to travelers generally, they usually distinguished between "Mormon" caravans and others; and while they would steal from most travelers they often left the "Mormon Pioneer Trains" alone. During the early part of their trek the Lowry Company had plenty of food and to spare, but on reaching the mountain country the appetites of all but the sick increased, and yet those in charge were forced to cut down the rations owing to the fact that some of the provisions that had been cached at different points along the way to Wyoming to be used by the
company on their return, had been stolen by Indians or renegade whites. Thus many of the more hearty of them suffered for lack of sufficient food and sometimes longed for good square meals again. They generally broke camp about 8 o'clock each morning and traveled from 12 to 20 miles a day, stopping about two hours at noon to cook and feed themselves and animals. The day's journey was somewhat monotonous at times and most were <span id="page-199"></span>glad to see the wagons drawn up to form a corral, when they could stop and rest their weary feet for a spell. The young people, however, never seemed to tire and were usually bent on having their dancing and lively sports at the day's end, until the call of the horn summoned all together for song and prayer before retiring. Then dancing and all other music ceased as hundreds of voices were lifted in a hymn of praise. What mattered if they sang in different tongues - the Almighty Father understood all. The hymn finished, utmost quiet would prevail throughout the camp as one of the Elders prepared to offer up a prayer of thanksgiving for the care and guidance given them that day. President Brigham Young had advised his followers to dance, sing and pray, and enjoy themselves together as they crossed the plains. He was wise in wanting them to forget their cares and sorrows as they could. And though these Pioneers rejoiced as each new day brought them nearer to their journey's end, it is unlikely that many in this company were ever very gay at any time, since the hand of death traveled with them all the way.

Shortly after the middle of September winter caught up with them as they reached the higher elevations. A terrific wind and snowstorm came down upon them and covered everything. It was difficult to find fuel for their fires or feed for
their oxen, some of which became badly frozen, a few almost to the point of disability. Some mornings it was only with much difficulty that the teamsters succeeded in getting the hungry and half frozen animals hitched up and on their way. Capt. Lowry and his associates knew that many more storms like this in the Rockies would prove treacherous, if not disasterous to the weary animals as well as the sick and elderly of the company, if not to all. So the captain sent a telegram to the authorities in Salt Lake City asking that relief be sent them if possible.

The identity of most of the emigrants of the Abner Lowry company was lost in the dust of covered wagons as they became just "Mormon Pioneers". Sometimes a name crops up here and <span id="page-200"></span>there, or an incident is recalled of some who came in that ill-fated wagon-caravan in 1866: Dorthy Madsen of Manti tells of her great grandmother, Christena Roth Jensen of Holstein, Germany, who came with her husband and children on the ship "Cavour". Her husband, Louis Jensen, a Dane from Copenhagen, died as they followed with the Lowry company along the Sweetwater River in Wyoming Territory, 11 Sep. 1866, and was buried there the next day. Feeling very alone then and hardly knowing what to do, she knelt down and prayed to her Heavenly Father for guidance as to whether to eventually go back to her people in the Old Country or to settle in Zion. At this moment, as she looked up into Heaven, she beheld a bright star in the western sky. This immediately struck her as being an answer to her prayers and she knew then that she must settle in the west. So this brave thirty-five year old mother took her small fatherless children, from five years to nine months old, including twins, and settled in Sanpete Valley at Manti. Utah's last original pioneer, Hilde Anderson Erickson, who passed away January 1968 at one hundred and eight years of age, came with the Abner Lowry Company across the plains and
settled first in Sanpete. Perhaps one of the most pathetic stories of members of the Abner Lowry Company that has yet come to light is the one told by a Swedish Saint who came on the ship "Cavour". This is how sixteen year old Charles Peter Warnick told it:-- "I, together with my parents, Anders Peter and Anna Helena Anderson Warnick, my two brothers, John August and Anders Gustave, my sister Anne Christine, two sisters-in-law and three children, left our native land in the latter part of April 1866. We were thankful that we had thus been blessed of the Lord that we were able to go to Zion where we might live and worship with those of our faith, without fear of mobs or ridicule, But alas! How short sighted are we human beings! We boarded the sailing vessel "Cavour" at Hamburg, June 1st 1866, for our trip across the great Atlantic. The supply of water was very limited for such a long journey, which lasted nine weeks. We were allowed one quart of water per family per day. The water itself was terribly bad. Other rations were<span id="page-201"></span>likewise limited and of poor quality. Sickness broke out among the passengers. I was so sick my mother worried as to whether I would be allowed to land. But that part went all right and we were glad once more to set foot on Mother Earth and to enjoy the luxury of good cold water, as the weather was warm.

"When we landed at New York we went directly to Castle Garden and from there to Montreal, Canada. When we saw the string of cars into which we were being herded, our hearts almost failed us. But what could we do about it? We were on the road and must follow it through even though we were treated like cattle, for that was the kind of cars the train was made up of. But those awful hard and dirty cars proved to be a blessing in disguise, for we had not been long on the train when cholera broke out in a very serious form among the people. The poor stricken souls couldn't have sat up, so with room to spread their bedding down it was better for them. But oh how they suffered with the jarring and bumping of the cars.  When we had traveled three days my dear mother passed away, on the fifth of August, she being one of the first to go. Her body was left on the station platform at Marcella.  Conditions continued to get worse and when we reached St. Joseph a few days later, my father and sister Christine were left dying on the platform. When I look back and think of that awful scene I wonder how we could do it, and I can only think that we saw so much suffering and death that our sense of feeling and sympathy must have been paralyzed. We thought that we were all doomed and nothing mattered - the sooner the better.

"We met ox teams at Wyoming, Nebraska and started for Salt Lake City on August 13th. The company we traveled with was made up of teams and men from Sanpete County. Our Captain's name was Abner Lowry and he was from Manti. But the
angel of death had not finished his work; many of our companions were left in shallow graves by the roadside. One noon, as we were camping, all the men that were able were busy digging one large grave in which seven bodies were buried. We had <span id="page-202"></span>not been out many days when my brother Anders Gustave said to me, 'Let us pray for we don't know how soon our turn will come.' How true he spoke, for it was only two days later when he passed away and it was only a few days after that when his betrothed, Charlotte Bengsten, died; also one of my brother August's children and a little girl of my dead sister Christine. Before we reached our journey's end another of August's children died, making eight of our number who passed away on this terrible journey. I remember especially one whole family that died and in many instances there were just one or two left of large families. This was the darkest chapter in my life, but yet in this great suffering and bereavement we knew they died in the faith and in hopes of reaching a better land. Our family was now just John, August and his wife, Mary Bengsten Warnick, their little girl Caroline, and myself. Their baby, born on the plains, was numbered among the dead. I was then sixteen years old."

Of course it was not unusual for pioneers to die on their way to the Valleys of the Mountains - but whole families, how sad that was! In the three companies of mostly Scandinavians that preceded Capt. Abner Lowry's, numbers failed to reach their destinations; ten persons having died in Capt. Rawling's company, close to thirty in Capt. Nebeker's and about the same in Capt, Scott's. But the toll was much greater in this last of the Church trains of 1866. The death rate, mostly from cholera, was extremely high, the rough estimate is at least fifty, but no one really knows just how many among this ill-fated company battled for their lives with that terrible malady - and lost.

Autumn's heat upon dry desert plains - parched lips - chapped and bleeding hands; sharp rocks and prickly thistles - torn, burning, blistered feet; tugging, sweating ox and grinding wheels of overloaded wagons - sting of dust in eyes and nostrils; fevered brows - dysentery from which so many suffered - swarming flies and gnats - these were but a few of the "little things" that vexed and annoyed them - these emigrant pioneers. These could in no way compare with their greater burdens - the never <span id="page-203"></span>ending, poignant yearning for home, salt spray or sound of sea, or the far deeper pain of grief and longing for loved ones who would never return. And so at nights on the plains, under the impersonal, remote stars, many from the lands of sea-washed kingdoms could not sleep, but lay and moaned for things that would not-leave them, quite alone.

What part the Christensens from Thy played in this tragic drama in the wilderness is little known since few details of their trek have filtered down to their posterity. We know that at least the adults of the group walked most of the way. They were not city-bred, like some, but country folk from the harshest part of Jutland, strong and vigorous people in the main. Thus the wearisome journey must have perhaps proved less exacting for them physically than for numbers of others in the same company. It has been said that this long hard journey brought about, by natural processes, a selection of the strong in body, mind or spirit; for, as has further been stated, -- "The cowards never started and the weak died on the way." Who can say? We fully believe, however, that our Christensens were among those who helped the less fortunate along the way. At least this was the case with one particular emigrant family of which we have been told. Christen Christensen had paid the fare of Hans Jensen and his wife and three children from Jutland. He thought so much of this young family and was most sorrowful when both the father and the mother died of cholera on the plains, He arranged to take care of the orphan children the remainder of the journey. Did his fatherly and generous nature, and the sympathetic and understanding character of the other members of his party, send them to the aid of others of the
distressed in whatever capacities they could serve? We think so. Surely all of them must have gathered at many gravesides on the plains, to offer help and comfort to the bereaved during the bleak, anguished burials of their dead. The Christensens and Myrups knew the value of sympathy, for they themselves were well acquainted with the sorrow of a dear one's passing.

Andrew Jenson wrote: this of the Abner Lowry <span id="page-204"></span>Company:-- "If the details of this company's journey across the plains were written, it would probably present one of the most pitiable and heartrending chapters in the history of the Church; but it is perhaps better to close the episode and not revive the memory of something so touching and sorrowful. At some future date, undoubtedly, more details will be published about the experience of that ill-fated company; and in the great hereafter those who laid down their lives on the way will have an opportunity to give an accurate and truthful account of their sufferings."

*****

Sept. 27th, the Abner Lowry company was met at the Three Crossings of the Sweetwater by Capt. Arza Hinkley's relief train which had been sent out from Salt Lake City some 450 miles to help these belated emigrants continue on. Taking the sick and aged aboard, this mule train headed west again and arrived in Salt Lake on Sun. Oct. 7th, two weeks before the main Lowry company. According to historian Jenson, this relief train was the last of the Church trains sent out to bring the poor to Zion that year of 1866. In all, these were made up of some 10 captains, 456 teamsters, 49 mounted guards, 89 horses, 195 mules, 3,092 oxen and 459 wagons, the largest part of which traveled all the way to Wyoming, Nebraska and back. A church that cared this much for the lives of these poor emigrants would not be inclined to abandon them when they joined the body of the Saints in their "Promised Land". 

Much heartened and their loads lightened, the remaining emigrants continued their travels along the Mormon Trail. Since they encountered more severe snowstorms during some of the rest of the journey, the mortality among them would likely have been much higher had they not received this aid from Captain Hinkley's relief train. At South Pass this telegram was sent to the authorities in Salt Lake City: "South Pass, Oct. 3. We camped here last night - all well - Ab Lowry". From there the company crossed Little Sandy, Big Sandy, Green River, Hams Fork, and Black Fork to Fort Bridger, where the captain sent another telegram to the <span id="page-205"></span>brethren; -- "Bridger, Wyo. Oct, 11 We camp
tonight on the Muddy - Ab Lowry". A well beaten road led them from the Muddy River by way of Bear River, Yellow Creek, etc., to the mouth of Echo Canyon, thence up along the Weber River ten miles via the present sites of Coalville, Hoytsville and Wanship, buffeting storms and cold most of the way. Next their route led them through Silver Creek Canyon, Parleys Park, and then over the mountain and through Parleys Canyon, at the mouth of which they entered Great Salt Lake Valley. Here the mountains no longer came together to close the view and by climbing up to a bluff, a short distance above where the old Utah penitentiary later stood, they could see Salt Lake City in the distance, northwest, "How beautiful - how grand!" was shouted back by those who ascended to behold with rapture the "City of the Saints!" -- the place they had all dreamed of, and prayed and hoped so long to see. Ja, Ja; here it was at last - their Zion - their Promised Land!

With mounting excitement the company continued down the mountain pass and on over the area now called Sugar House; then crossing the State road, they entered the Church farm where they camped for the night. The next morning, which was Mon, Oct, 22, 1866, all were eager to fix themselves up before taking to the road again, so it was approaching noon before they had driven the additional four miles northward and entered the Church Tithing Office yard in the heart of Great Salt Lake City. Here they were expected, for word had gone ahead, and there was quite a crowd of welcomers to greet them. Some of the Scandinavians who had preceded them in the three earlier companies were there, and some seeking to claim the many orphans. Saints who were lucky enough to have friends or kinfolk already living in the vicinity were met by these, and the vanguard of their company, the sick, most of them recovered, and the elderly - were there also. There was an abundance of joy and thanksgiving manifested on all sides - but undertones of sorrow too, for those who were expected and never came.

<span id="page-206"></span>There must have been a number to welcome the Christensens from Jutland - newly made friends of the "Kenilworth" - old friends who had come before. Can we imagine the thrill of it, as long lost friends embraced and passed on the news and
greetings from the Old Country in their harsh Jutlandic Danish brogue? A great spirit of brotherhood had grown up among these Latter-day Saints; bonds of friendship had been forged which were to last to the end of living - and who was there to say they would not last for aye? Time moves so quickly. It had been more than six months since these friendly folks had left their home in Kobberod, near the beautiful Limfjord; yet here they were in Zion with snow-capped mountains surrounded - all but the gentle Karen. Soon the bitter heartbreak of the past would vanish like a dream and they would begin to build new homes and sink their roots in the valleys of the mountains.

Those of us living today who might have driven up Emigration Canyon to the summit of the present highway, then turned right and followed a side road briefly to the top of Little Mountain, just as a giant moon came looming over the Wasatch peaks to the east, and turned to look down on Parleys Canyon road, would have seen a queue of lights from swiftly moving autos, twinkling like a tiny chain of crystal stars. And then, if we had turned around and gazed over the canyon's mountain tops towards Salt Lake Valley, we would have seen the night-glow of the great city which the Saints planted there. None of us can imagine the work and energy that went into the building of Salt Lake City and its suburbs - or any other city, town or village in Utah for that matter - without a sense of awe and wonder. From the very first settlers wearily trooping onto the hot, dry desert floor, and the thousands following and building, the cost
in effort and sacrifice is immeasurable. There was no easy road for our pioneer progenitors. No one with values can think on these things from high on top a mountain, where air and reason are clear and cool, without sensing that people with outstanding faith and great courage toiled to leave us this marvelous legacy. These noble predecessors of ours built a mighty empire because they themselves<span id="page-207"></span>were mighty - in brain and brawn - in courage, valour and honesty! They cared little for what lesser souls thought and said of them. We enjoy the fruits of their building today and we ought to be glad and thankful for it. President Heber J. Grant once said, -- "Dream, young man - dream
nobly and manfully - and your dreams will be your prophets". We have been given a heritage bought by noble dreams.

## WAR WHOOPS AND DRUMS

After having made the decision to move to a land uninhabited except by the American Indians, the Mormon leaders admonished their people to deal justly with them following a policy of friendship and the "open hand". Though this proved somewhat successful in the colonization of the area the sensitivity and emotional makeup of the Indian was such that a slight or often imagined grievance was enough to start a war. Such seems to have been the case in the "Walker War" that had bled the new territory in 1853-54, although frequent small irritations, and some not so small, had been leading up to this explosion for some
years. As early as 1850 proud, haughty Chief Walker (Walkara) had planned to massacre the people of Fort Utah (Provo) because Brigham Young refused to send some of his settlers to aid Walker in a battle against the Shoshones. Fortunately, Chief Sowiette, the pioneers' friend, interceded and calmed the fiery tempered Chief.

The Mormon leaders were soon made aware that something more than food and friendship would have to be used to cope with the Indians. Their policy had been a noble one, but the frequent infringements by the red brethren - their child-like inability to refrain from petty thievery, as well as other irresponsible behavior - placed a great burden on the struggling settlers. As one incident after another occurred, President Brigham Young realized the need for some form of military organization and thus determined to reorganize the Nauvoo Legion, which had been an integral part of the Church in Illinois. This <span id="page-208"></span>was done at a meeting held in Salt Lake City April 12, 1852, where appointment of officers was made and Daniel H. Wells chosen as Lieutenant General. The defense of the people of Utah and the protection of their property became the major concern of this organization. Much vigilance and tact was called
for by the Legion members.

In spite of the subduing of Walker and his warriors, who had vowed their war would last until all the whites were exterminated, and in spite of the peace treaty they had signed with Brigham Young in May 1854, the stealing and killings went on, causing much destruction of livestock and some loss of human life. Indian attacks on travelers and settlements usually came when least expected; for example: June 4, 1858 - Jens Jorgensen and wife, Jens Terkelsen and Christian E. Kjerulf were massacred in Salt Creek Canyon while traveling unarmed to Sanpete Valley; Oct. 15 - the remains of Josiah Call and Samuel Brown of Fillmore were found near Chicken Creek bridge in Juab County - the mutilation of their bodies proved it was the work of redmen; Mar. 22, 1860 - the Overland
mailcoach was attacked by Indians near Eight Mile Station, Tooele County, with Henry Harper, the driver, being killed and a passenger wounded; May 28, in the same county, Indians attacked the mail station at Deep Creek, shot a man and stole several horses; July 22, Smithfield, Cache County was attacked by Indians and a fight ensued during which John Reed and Ira Merrill and two Indians were killed and several on both sides wounded; Apr. 12, 1863 - a band of about fifty Indians, led by Chief Little Soldier, attacked a group of soldiers from Fort Douglas who were camped at Pleasant Grove, Utah County, who frightened them away with a small cannon but lost their horses, blankets and supplies in the fray; June 10 - Wood Reynolds and another unarmed man were killed when a stagecoach was attacked by mounted Indians between Fort Chittenden and the Jordan in Utah County. The attacking Indians sometimes wore little clothing - a breech clout and moccasins being their uniforms. Some painted their faces black on occassions, but they always had guns, pistols or bows
and quivers of arrows, besides their knives or<span id="page-209"></span>tomahawks. These were but a few of the many incidents leading up to the Black Hawk Indian War which engulfed the settlers in this territory from 1866 to 1869, particularly those of Sanpete, Sevier and other southern counties, becoming Utah's bloodiest conflict of the last century.

The Black Hawk War is said to have officially begun at Manti in Sanpete Valley Apr. 9, 1865. Research seems to warrant the account presented by Carlton Culmsee as probably the most logical record of the event: -- "Black Hawk sat in sacrament meeting one peaceful Sunday in Manti. He stared at the speakers as if absorbed in their words. Perhaps he was. Perhaps, however, the tall chief was thinking of a tribe of Utes not far away, who were full of superstitious anger at these white men. Those Utes were like dead leaves of rabbit brush, like good timber. If a spark fell among them --- ! But whatever reveries Black Hawk had, he listened keenly to one part of the meeting. Plans were announced for rounding up the livestock in the district of the Indian farm at Twelve Mile Creek. This was to be the customary general spring roundup. Meeting ended. Black Hawk went to the house of James Tooth, where he customarily ate after the services.

"Meanwhile, an historic event was occurring at Jerome Kempton's place in the same town. Some leading Utes had met with prominent settlers to discuss the recent outbreak of cattle stealing. John Lowry and Archibald Buchanan acted as interpreters. In the circle of onlookers were Kempton, David Shand Sr., J.C. Madsen, Jens Madsen, Arthur Vorhees, Louis Kjar and Peter Munk. Matters appeared to be approaching an amicable settlement in the hands of these frontier
diplomats, the interpreters. All that interfered was an irreconcilable among the Indians - Jake Arropeen. He was a young sub-chief whose father had died of the smallpox which had attacked the band the preceding winter. Jake believed the whites had enlisted the aid of evil spirits and murdered his father by supernatural means, so he refused to be soothed. He rode about shouting that he would "kill Mormons and eat Mormon beef".<span id="page-210"></span>John Lowry at length became exasperated. He commanded the chief to be quiet. Suddenly someone cried 'Lowry, look out! He's going to shoot!' Before the Indian could draw his bow, Lowry sprang at him. He seized him by the shirt collar and jerked him off his horse. He talked to him sharply and then released him, Some accountshav e it that Lowry was drunk, that he insulted the chief, infuriating the tribesmen. Thus the guilt for starting the war is frequently laid upon Lowry's shoulders. But Peter Munk, one of the eyewitnesses, swears that version is false. He declares Lowry, in all sobriety, simply acted swiftly when warned of danger."

Most of the settlers of this small community of Manti were in meeting on this apparently peaceful Sunday morning. A few of the men had stayed in front of the little store, talking. They had watched unconcernedly as Jake Arropeen rode into the fort. They were entirely unprepared for the swiftness with which the mood changed from one of peace to blatant danger as John Lowry and Chief Arropeen clashed in anger. Meanwhile, Chief Black Hawk, sensing further trouble, abruptly left the Manti fort and returned to the Indian camp where he hurried the squaws, children and old men, together with camp equipment, off to the mountains, leaving the braves in support of Arropeen, who subsequently also rode angrily away.

That afternoon the settlers called a meeting to see how best to handle this unexpected crisis. Realizing that their cattle which were roaming the entire valley would be most vulnerable, they asked for volunteers to start the next morning to round them up. Thus, on the morning of April 10th, a small party of unarmed men from Manti started for the Indian farm at Twelve Mile Creek to gather the stock. On the way they were attacked by Indians, who killed young Peter Ludvigsen and put the others to flight. They returned to the fort with word about Ludvigsen and soon a party of armed men on horseback, together with a team and wagon, set out to recover the body, which they found face down in a prickly-pear bush. According to Peter Munk, all clothing except the sox had been<span id="page-211"></span>removed and the Indians had cut a strip of flesh from the back. This they had roasted and each taken a bite - a sure sign of war with the Indians. The mutilated body was laid carefully: in the wagon and brought back to Manti for burial. Tat same evening Elijah B. Ward and James Andersen were killed and scalped by Indians in Salina Canyon, who also drove away a number of cattle belonging to the settlers there."

So a war was on and Black Hawk and his minions worked havoc. Raiding, stealing, torturing, plundering and killing became the Indians' pastime. Their war-whoops could be heard, curdling the air as they swooped down unsuspectedly on the often helpless settlers. They seemed to specialize in the art of surprise and ambuscade. This became a time of terror as the savages came shooting their arrows and guns, killing and pilfering that which the Saints had built. It was a time when farmers could not work in their fields or go to the canyons for wood without the aid of armed men. Herds of stock needed guarding day and night. Even in the settlements themselves no one was safe. As a result, entire counties were abandoned by the frightened settlers and left to the redmen. The larger communities that had no forts were advised to build them, and here the homeless ones gathered for protection. None felt safe.

It was fortunate for the people of Utah that with customary foresight President Brigham Young had ordered the re-activation of the Nauvoo Legion. The machinery having therefore already been set up to protect the people, it remained only to alert every male resident of the territory as to his duty in the common struggle; for although this war was initially contained in the two counties of Sanpete and Sevier, it soon spread until nearly every area of the State was more or less affected. Brigham Young issued the following instructions in Aug. 1865:

"It is required by the laws of the Territory of Utah of every male citizen from eighteen to forty-five to be armed and equipped and ready for any duty he may be called upon to perform as one of the militia of the county; and if any refuse<span id="page-212"></span>to obey the laws of the land, I would try them before their bishops for that as readily as I would if they were to refuse to pay a just debt; and if they would not repent I would sever them from the Church and give them over to the laws of the land. I do not know that there is one person in the Territory who would refuse to perform military duty, there are strangers in our midst, but I very much doubt if one could be found who would refuse to do military duty."

The history of the Black Hawk War is filled with incidents of the killing of men, women and children without warning or a chance to defend themselves. During the first year alone it was estimated that the Indians drove off as plunder
2,000 head of cattle and horses and killed between 30 and 40 whites. Manti became the center of activities against the redmen, although they were pursued and attacked in many different locations. General Warren Stone Snow was given full command of the Sanpete military district in 1865 and played a conspicuous part in the war. Nauvoo Legion cavalry companies from Davis, Salt Lake, Utah and other northern counties made Manti their headquarters on many occasions to assist him and his men in their efforts to save the lives and property of their fellow sufferers.

Oct. 17th of that year, Martin Pedersen Kuhre and wife, Elizabeth Petersen, William Thorpe, Soren N. Jespersen, Benj. J. Black and William T. Hite were killed by Indians led by Chief Black Hawk. This happened near the settlement of Ephraim, Sanpete Co., six miles north of Manti. This was the last raid of the year in that area, as the Indians there, well supplied with "Mormon beef" for the winter, withdrew to their hideouts in the mountains. But the Indian War continued in the warmer parts of southern Utah and a number of the smaller settlements there were abandoned by the settlers. The campaigns of these cunning natives could not safely be minimized, let alone be regarded with disdain or
contempt. Otherwise inefficient, these redmen were dangerously proficient in their specialized skill, the art of war. Their guerrilla tactics kept<span id="page-213"></span> the frontier settlements in hot water, to say the least, and the militia on the jump.

The spring of 1866 had scarcely broken when the redskins swooped down from their winter retreats to carry on their devilish sport of plundering and killing again. Horror once more rode bareback through the valleys! The sound of big bass
drums boomed out over hamlet and village; men grabbed their guns and headed for their horses and women snatched up their little ones and ran to shelter for their lives. All settlements south and east of Salt Lake City were placed in a state of defense and Nauvoo Legion troops were ordered to the scenes of hostilities. Apr. 2 Joseph and Robert Berry and the latter's wife were killed by Indians near a ranch on Short Creek in Kane county. Apr. 20 - The Indians attacked Salina, Sevier county, drove off about two hundred head of stock and killed two men who were guarding them. Soon afterwards the settlers vacated Salina and removed to Gunnison, Sanpete Co. No one knew when or where the bloodthirsty redskins would strike or who would be the next victim.

May 1st - President Brigham Young sent out a proclamation instructing the people in Sanpete, Piute and Sevier counties to collect themselves together in bodies of not less than 150 men, arm themselves well and protect their people and stock from the Indians. Guns were scarce and many a white brother traded a good steer for a poor rifle during those treacherous times. The able-bodied men of the communities were gathered together into fighting groups and often spread out over the country chasing the foe, sometimes leaving only the women, children and elderly men in the thinly settled areas. On such occasions the people realized their helpless condition, especially when the beat of the big drums warned them Indians were coming, and they gathered in fright into the small public squares with pitchforks and shotguns, while whooping Indians could be seen driving their herds away and shooting down their brothers and sisters before their very eyes. Armed militia were once again sent from the counties to the north to help those in Sanpete and Sevier, while <span id="page-214"></span>the few remaining residents of Piute county moved together into Circleville.

While the hostile redmen craftily avoided the military on most occasions, yet they continued their atrocities upon the settlers, as well as the raids on their livestock. Striking sometimes north, sometimes south, they drove the white
men's herds off into the mountains, killing anyone who got in their way. By the late autumn of that second year of this bloody war it was estimated that, like the year before, over 2,000 head of cattle and horses had been stolen, as well as about fifty Indians and more than twenty whites killed. It was further estimated that at least 2,500 men were under arms during that year of 1866. What a sacrifice in lives, time and means for a poor, struggling territory to be forced to endure!

*****

In Salt Lake City that latter part of October, the Abner Lowry company of Scandinavian emigrants and their escorts loaded up once again, in preparation for the remainder of their journey, and headed south towards Sanpete Valley. Capt.
Lowry and his associates were anxious to get to their homes and families in the various settlements there. The newly arrived Saints must surely have been initiated into the threat of the Black Hawk Indian war through numerous, frightening tales of raids and killings in the area where they were going. The guards and teamsters were well armed, as was usual on such trips, and although the fear of Indians was not as great or attacks as likely when approaching winter spread its mantle, yet it was always advisable now to be prepared and on the lookout for dusky intruders; not knowing when uninvited guests might come with arrows and tomahawks!

As the wagon train moved out of Salt Lake Valley the Christensens from Thy were aboard. Most everyone was allowed to ride on this trip, since the loads had been considerably lightened. Christen Christensen himself was very much disturbed about something. During the excitement and confusion of their arrival and welcome in Salt <span id="page-215"></span>Lake City - greetings from friends - passing on the news and such from Old Denmark and all that Hans Jensen's orphans had disappeared! Someone had come to Tithing Office Square and taken them away unbeknown to the Christensens, who had subsequently been unable to find out who it was or anything at all about their whereabouts. All questions and searching had failed to turn up one thing on the matter. So, as they rode along south, Christen fretted about this, perhaps more than he did about Indians. He had fully intended to make arrangements for the future care and keeping of
those children himself.

The ox-drawn wagons stopped at each settlement of any consequence enroute to let off a few passengers and their baggage, but the majority were going to Sanpete. They could scarcely make more than twenty miles in an average day, since
it was necessary for the animals and teamsters to rest at intervals, particularly at nights. Also, night driving could prove extremely dangerous with Indians on the warpath. Naturally the teamsters made great effort to reach a settlement for each evenings camping, since this was far less risky and a heap more pleasant and comfortable with friends from these places around them. Sometimes merriment and entertainment were provided specially. Pleasant Grove was selected for the first nights rest, and here they bid farewell to young Andrew Jenson, his brother and parents who had joined them at Salt Lake, having left the Scott company there earlier, as well as what was left of the Warnick family. Capt. Scott's train had gone directly to Utah County where its wagons had mostly come from, so the Lowry group were able to renew pleasantries with some of their former "Kenilworth" friends in that place, as well as in other Utah County settlements at which they stopped to rest.

As the emigrants from Little Denmark viewed the patchwork of farms and stretches of sage along their line of travel, they must have been impressed with the vast amount of good, fertile land yet to be tilled in Utah. It was not so in the Old Country where they came from. Stopping at Nephi in Juab County about their fourth night out, they undoubtedly <span id="page-216"></span>viewed that village with interest, since they had heard of some of the Indian troubles that had taken
place in early spring of that very year, when many Indians had been taken prisoners and jailed there, including several Indian Chiefs, who were later taken by General Snow and his men to Manti, where they eventually broke jail. The travelers could have heard here of a recent outrageous attack (Oct. 23) on a family near Beaver, Utah, when Indians surrounded their ranch house at daybreak, set fire to the roof and tried with guns and pitch forks to exterminate the occupants and would have, save for the heroic flight for help of a young boy. Such stories sent chills down most spines; and if any of the Lowry company had put Indians out of their minds at that point they must have been jerked up to a state of renewed vigilance at hearing of those details.

Just east of Nephi lay Salt Creek Canyon through which they had to pass. It had proved to be a dangerous route for whites during any Indian trouble. A number had been ambushed there that very year. The road was narrow, rough, muddy
and snow patched then, winding through hills often pressing close on both sides obstructing the view. It was easy here for savages to swoop down on unsuspecting travelers and be off again up a well hidden canyon as fast as they came. As the Lowry ox train picked its way through, we can be sure that most of its passengers were on the lookout and filled with apprehension, if not outright fear. The end of this canyon marked the boundary line between Juab and Sanpete counties, and beyond that south six miles was Fountain Green, a small settlement with a newly built rock fort. Located on Uinta Creek, it was first called Uinta Springs but later changed to Fountain Green because of the water running from a spring in the mountains and spreading over the beautiful green grass meadow where the small village lay. This had become a favorite camping place for settlers going to and from Salt Lake to south Sanpete. Early that past spring the people of Fountain Green had been ordered to move to the Moroni Fort about seven miles south, as a protection against Chief Black <span id="page-217"></span>Hawk's warriors, as their settlement had been subject to several Indian raids. While living in Moroni that summer of 1866, the Fountain Green settlers had built a fort of their own and had just moved back to the settlement to occupy it.

It had been decided beforehand that Christen Christensen and his younger daughters, Pauline, Petrine and Nielsene, as well as Anne Jensen, would stop off at Fountain Green and spend the winter with friends there and in Moroni. The family things therefore had been sorted and repacked in preparation for it, since Laurs and Else, Maren and Lars Myrup were continuing south to Manti. It had also been pretty well decided that Christen and Anne would be wed soon after they reached their destination, He desperately needed a mother for his children and Anne seemed just the one for the job. She had proved to be well qualified for it and the little girls loved her; besides she and Christen had become very fond of each other. Elder Morten Lund, who had come all the way from Aalborg in their company, also dropped off at Fountain Green for this was his home and here his wife and children awaited him. It is quite possible that it was Elder Lund who, nearly three weeks later (Nov. 17, 1866), performed the marriage ceremony that made Christen and Anne husband and wife.

The rock fort there had been constructed much like other forts in the territory. Its inner walls backed each dwelling and all doors opened into it. On each corner was a bastion where guards were on the lookout at all times. One
large gate provided the only outside entrance to the fort, and all public gatherings were held in its center. Drums were beaten to warn its inhabitants of any approaching enemy. Into this fort Christen, Anne and the girls moved, as well as any other incoming emigrants of the Lowry company who had chosen to stay at Fountain Green. Likely Christen had long since disposed of the last of his vest lining gold pieces, for it has been said that he spent his last change here to buy milk for his young daughters. No matter, the settlers there must have just moved-over-a-bit and taken <span id="page-218"></span>them all in, for that's the way folks were in early Utah Zion.

*****

It was some twenty-eight miles south from Fountain Green to the town of Manti, largest and oldest permanent settlement in Sanpete Valley. It was the first of November before the remainder of the company reached there. Many had been dropped along the way. Here the teams and passengers disbanded - it was the end of the line. It had now been six-and-a-half months since the Christensens left their home in Thy, but in the interim they had crossed a mighty ocean and a vast continent - from lowland seas to highest mountains - left all they had to start other homes. It is hard for us of this jet generation to comprehend the magnitude of it from their point of view. Far more difficult than the physical hardships, the partings, the tedium of sailing ship and plodding ox team travel and all that, was the putting behind them of old thinking, language, habits, beliefs and old securities - to face the unknown. As Laurs and Else Christensen and Maren and Lars Myrup alighted in Manti, with little ought but their meager baggage and each other, they might have said to themselves in their mixed up broken English, -- "Ja, Ve are here but vot now?"

Manti then was a seventeen year old settlement, having been first occupied by Mormon pioneers in November 1849. Many were the tales told of those first struggling years of rattlesnakes, grasshoppers, drought, hunger, Indians, massacres,
death - but then again of courage, steadfastness, brotherhood, building, romance, miracles and thanksgiving. The inhabitants had built a fort around them during the Walker War (1854) as a greater protection against destructive redmen. Called the Big Fort, it consisted of a continuous rock wall twelve feet high, three feet wide at the bottom and two feet wide at the top, surrounding an area of some nine square blocks or more, beginning at the corner of First North and First East streets and running south and west from there. Bastions were built on its southeast and northwest corners. Manti Creek ran diagonally through its northeast <span id="page-219"></span>part, supplying plenty of water. Thus fortified,
the town itself had grown up mostly within this wall, with dwellings of adobe, log, rock or even dugout, as well as a few stores and businesses situated here and there at intervals along its streets. A square block in the central part of the area was set aside as a public square and known as the "Tabernacle Block". On this block were housed the two main points of community interest, the "Bowery" and the "Council House".

Every early Mormon settlement had its "Bowery" and Manti was no exception. A huge shed supported by logs and roofed with thick layers of boughs and willows was erected where the Manti High School was later located. This open-air affair sheltered Conference goers and worshipers in summers and inclement weather. It accommodated the whole of the townspeople on Fourth and Twenty-fourth of July celebrations and such. Even after new quarters were built for worship and celebrations, it became a playground for school children in bad weather until it collapsed one rainy day, suddenly and without warning, catching a group of boys under its sodden mass. Luckily none were killed, though some were dazed or injured - but the whole town was wild with excitement while it lasted.

The "Council House", a large two-story rock building, had been erected in 1855-56 just east of the Bowery on the site where the Manti Library now stands. It served the people of the town well for fifty years. Everyone went to church there, but it was the place of many other activities as well, since educational, social, civic and recreational functions of all kinds were held there too. It is surprising the variety and extent of such things the people of Manti found time for in those early days, with so much hard work to be done. Concerts, dramas, musicals, rallies, dances and celebrations of all kinds were held in the Council House, for it seemed that the buoyant spirit encouraged by the pioneer leaders, as a balance against trials and hardships, waxed strong in the bosoms of those early "Sanpeters".

The upper story of the Council House was <span id="page-220"></span>approached by a narrow wood stairway climbing an outside wall of the building. In the late '60s it became necessary to strengthen the upper floor by adding supports underneath. A stage and dressing rooms were added to that second story at the same time (1867) so that the home dramatic companies who held forth there on various occasions could put on better productions. Dances were also held on
the top floor and this was by far the most popular of all forms of entertainment with most of these early settlers. Dancing parties on this rough, knotty-pine floor to the music of "Fiddler Hansen", as he taught new jigs and steps, were the constant delight of anyone in Manti old enough or bold enough to "trip the light fantastic". Whatever one called for - quadrilie, Mazurka, Schottische, Waltz-quadrill, Heal-and-Toe Polka, French Four, etc. he had it!

It must in no way be assumed that entertainment and jollity took precedence over worship in early Manti, for indeed such was not the case. Here nearly everyone went to church, for that is what had brought them all west across wilderness
and oceans in the first place -- to be able to worship how, when and where they chose, and in peace and safety. It so happened that the first settlers of Manti were mostly Yankees, in whose veins flowed the blood of Pilgrims and Puritans. Theirs was a heritage of worship, Scandinavian emigrants, much humbled by persecution, sacrifice and privation, had later come in numbers and been added to the fold. They were even more reverent in spirit, if this were possible, having been well taught by humble missionaries and having felt the hand of the Almighty all the way in their travels to the "Promised Land".

That very year of 1866, as an added protection during the Black Hawk War, another rock wall had been built within the Big Fort, enclosing the Tabernacle Block. A fence was built through the center of this "Little Fort", dividing the enclosure so that one part could be used in case of Indian attack for corralling the town's stock. If the big bass drums sounded a warning, in from the surrounding farms and fields the cattle and horses would be driven on <span id="page-221"></span>the run, while into the other side of the divided area the women and children would flock for safety.

The only means of communication with the outside world in the Utah Territory, outside of the Great Salt Lake area, was by walking, or trips made on horseback, or by horse, mule or ox-drawn conveyances. This must have been a lonely and even frightening situation to contemplate, especially in times of trouble. (In our age, when one can witness and hear events all over the world with a flick of a button, we can in no way imagine what this would be like.) There must have been rejoicing in the various areas involved then, when on Sat. Dec. 1st, 1866, the Deseret telegraph line was opened between Salt Lake City and Ogden; on Dec. 8th opened between there and Logan; and on Dec. 28th opened between Salt Lake City and Manti. (It is difficult to evaluate the importance played by the Deseret telegraph operators in Sanpete Valley during the remaining years of the Black Hawk War, as they took turns nights, sleeping on the floor of the office in case word should come from neighboring towns that the Indians were on the warpath. If an attack were coming the people would then be warned of the approaching danger by the rapid beating of drums.)

Having been taken into the homes of Danish friends for the time being, the two young emigrant couples must have made themselves as comfortable and useful as they could. The two brethren, Laurs M. C. and Lars C. N. must of course, have been taken into the militia right away and given their assigned work there as guards, minute men, armed cattle herders, or whatever. Since it was now considered too late in the season for any large scale Indian operation, they probably went into the mountains with others to get out logs and rock for contemplated dwellings of their own or the community, as well as wood for ever-hungry fires. That they toiled though we may be certain, for most everything there then was on a cooperative basis and all shared and shared alike.

Else and Maren as well must have had their share of work, learning the new "American" ways of keeping house and concocting victuals "a-la-mode"; <span id="page-222"></span> knitting, weaving, spinning, seaming, mixing, baking, churning, candle making, soap making, soup making - there was never any end to it. Undoubtedly they were able to teach the Yankee settlers some things too; there must have been quite a transplantation of Scandinavian culture to Sanpete Valley. Trying to learn the new language was a chore in itself; yet with so many Danes around, it could scarcely have been considered a pressing necessity to learn English. But Else at least was determined in this and somehow she seemed more apt at it than the others.

Being so friendly, healthy and young, they must have found time for dancing in the Council House and other entertainment and cultural events also. If there were any sports in order, like wrestling, horseshoes, handsprings and the like,
one was bound to find the two young Danish brethren, Christensen and Myrup, there. Quilting and rug bees doubtless attracted the girls; and if spelling bees were ever held in the Danish language, one would surely have found Else K, present, for she took eagerly to things of that nature. She knew her Danish! (But as long as she lived she never quite got her English V's and W's straightened out.)

*****

January 23, 1867 the Deseret News carried a speech by President Brigham Young, from which we quote excerpts: -- "All our past experience with the subtle Indians teaches us the force of the principle 'Eternal vigilance is the price of safety'. There is no season of the year when those who are exposed to the aggressions of the savages should relax their guard. We know that brethren in those regions have had much difficulty and hope they will keep their stock well guarded and lives and property preserved. Solitary individuals being or moving about, where Indians are liable to pounce upon them and kill them, manifest a degree of carelessness which is highly culpable. We earnestly hope that the brethren south will adopt every means in their power to guard against such dangers."

Early in 1867 it became plain to the settlers in Sanpete and Sevier counties that they were in for <span id="page-223"></span>another year of trouble. Many rumors were heard of depredations that were to be committed in the spring, such as; "When the snow is gone the Indians are going to get mad, east, west, north and south!" Thus, having tormented the settlers in the far south of the territory off and on all winter, the redmen began moving north in early spring. In large numbers they came from south and east, filled with new vigor and determination to massacre and mutilate the white settlers, or so it seemed. "Tue. Mar. 19th 1867, an attack was made upon Glenwood and the pioneer blacksmith, Merrit Staley, was killed and many of their livestock were taken. While some believed that the audacious Black Hawk was leading the raiders here, most historians know it was the daring Chief White Horse." -- "Mar. 21st, Early in the morning Jens Peter Peterson and his wife, Charlotte Amelia, with Mary Smith, a neighbor girl, left Richfield with ox team to go to Glenwood about five miles east to do some trading, having left their 18-months old baby girl with Mary's mother. Stores were few and Glenwood had one of the largest. In order to obtain some needed supplies, these people had ventured out, thinking that by starting early there would be no danger; though it was contrary to counsel for anyone to travel between settlements without armed escort. Because it was muddy they could not travel as fast as they had expected. When they came to the so-called "Black Ridge", east of the Sevier River, Indians were gathering stock along the river bottom. The redmen immediately attacked and killed Peterson and his wife. Mary Smith, shot through the arm, jumped from the wagon and ran down the hill; but as she got to the bottom an Indian shot her through the back. The savages scalped the man and woman, mutilating their bodies terribly, then leaped down the dugway to finish off the girl. Finding she had curly hair they left her scalp, as they were very superstitious of curly hair. They filled her wounds with rabbit brush. These atrocities were soon discovered and the citizens of Glenwood took after the Indians and gave battle. The Indians, however, were victorious and also succeeded in getting away with <span id="224"></span> about one hundred more head of stock. Such reports shocked all who heard them and Brigham Young, much concerned, counseled the bedeviled settlers to move north into older and stronger towns for safety.

Thus nearly all settlements on the upper Sevier and all in Kane and Piute counties were deserted by their inhabitants. Teams were sent from Manti, with a company of minutemen, to assist in moving all the residents of Glenwood and Richfield into Sanpete county. A policy was inaugurated placing all the livestock of the occupied settlements in Sanpete under strong guard both night and day, for these animals meant life to the communities in more ways than one, Companies of militia were sent in from the north to assist in the struggle, making their headquarters in Manti as they had the year before. General Snow was released as head of the Sanpete military district, which comprised all of southeast Utah, and General W. B. Page took his place. A "get tough" attitude was taken against the warring Indians, for the settlers were determined to have peace and safety or the extermination of every Indian throughout the land. The militia were authorized to kill every Indian buck who came on their trail and to spare only the squaws and papooses.

But if vigilance was relaxed in any degree, neither the cattle guards nor the military were any more safe than others, as was evidenced by the following: -- "At Fountain Green it was customary for a guard of at least ten men to be with the cowherd. On the morning of June 1st 1867, however, only five men were with it, the others having been detained in the settlement. As feed was plentiful the herd was taken only a short distance from town to graze. Two of the herders were stationed nearby on a knoll below which their horses were feeding. The other three were on the other side of the herd in a hollow by a ditch, cleaning some rabbits they had just killed. Those on the knoll saw ten persons riding fast from the east hills towards the herd, but thinking they were the additional herders, paid no more attention until the oncoming riders began shooting in their direction. The Indian group divided <span id="page-225"></span>as they drew near the outnumbered herders, six of them riding toward the two on the knoll who, having no time to warn their companions, rode quickly away for help. The other six Indians came upon the unsuspecting three in the hollow, shot young Lewis Lund in the center of the forehead at close range, wounded Jasper Robertson in the thigh but missed the third man. Then they took off with the herd. The body of Lund was later found, his powder-burned face down in Water Hollow ditch." The very next day, June 2nd, between Gunnison and Manti, at Twelve Mile Creek, another melancholy incident occurred. "Major John W. Vance, together with Capt. Miles, Sergt. Heber Houtz and Pvt. Nathan Tanner Jr., were just returning to Gunnison from a military drill in Manti. At dusk, while halting at the creek to water their horses, they were fired upon by ambushed Indians at close range. At the first fire Maj. Vance and his horse fell dead and Sergt. Houtz, with a groan, also fell from his horse as the animal wheeled suddenly out of the creek, Miles and Tanner, believing their companions to be dead, headed back to Manti for help in recovering the bodies. Later, Vance was found where he fell, pierced with two bullets, but Houtz had evidently recovered himself momentarily, after the first fire; for his body, shot with two bullets and seven arrows, was about five hundred yards from the scene of ambush." The savages always gave good measure when it came to shooting. If these tales seem remote to us, like something out of Cooper's novels, we should remember that these Danish progenitors of ours were very near to these things and perhaps more deeply involved in them than we can imagine. It was only with great fortitude that these people were able to save their lives and homes from these savage intruders.

Winter being a good time to work at building, it is likely that young Christensen and Myrup went about building shelters of some sort for themselves and their wives, on plots that had been alloted them within the confines of the Big Fort. Whether these were of rocks, logs, or merely dugout ones, is not known by us. One-roomed log cabins with possibly a lean-to each seems logical. They doubtless had <span id="page-226"></span>help from others of the established settlers and by spring of 1867 were able to move into their own quarters - their first real homes in the Valleys. That spring as well, Christen, Anne and the three girls came down from Moroni, where they had spent most of the winter; traveling in a company escorted by armed guards, as advised by the Prophet Brigham Young. Quarters for them were needed too. Perhaps they moved in temporarily with the two couples, or it may have been with Danish friends, while a house for them was erected.

Manti became a beehive of military activities again that spring and summer, with the Legion companies from the north marching and maneuvering to the sound of fifes and drums, and sometimes dashing off here and there on their mounts to the aid of stricken settlers or quickly forming into battle lines if the big talking-drums warned of approaching danger to the Big Fort itself. And not to be outdone, the local brethren, who were organized into various companies called the "Silver Grays", gathered each morning on the Tabernacle Block for early drill, summoned forth by the call of bugles. Individual assignments for each day followed as some were detailed as picket-guards for the town, others as members of scouting groups to search hills and cedars for signs of skulking 'Injuns".

Still others were charged to guard those who worked in the fields, or in the hills at logging, while others acted as minutemen, whose duty it was to be off and fighting at a moments notice should the bass drums call. Then there were always those sent to guard the town herd. At a given time each morning during the growing season, all the town cows would be brought by their owners to the stock enclosure on Tabernacle Block where well-armed guards would take them to pasture for the day's feeding.

Laurs Christensen and Lars Myrup both served with the Sanpete militia, first under General Warren Stone Snow and later under General Page. Christen Christensen himself also served in the Black Hawk Indian War, even though he was well past forty-five when men could be released from that military duty. (Nearly twenty years after his death his wife Anne received a pension <span id="page-227"></span>settlement for his service in that war.) Knowing the caliber of these Danes we can be pretty certain they never shirked any duty as sagebrush-soldiers. As they filled their various assignments each day, little could they have known that years and years later one of the sons of Laurs would wed a granddaughter of this same General Snow.

Laurs was a private in Captain John H. Tuttle's co., Utah Militia Infantry. One day he was one of a number of guards detailed to take the town herd to graze near Warm Springs, south of Manti, for here the grass grew lush and green from early spring to late fall. On this particular day the horse Laurs was riding became frightened, jumped sideways and reared up, throwing him off, while one of his feet still remained caught fast in the stirrup. The horse then started out on a run and it looked as if he were to be dragged to death, when suddenly his shoe gave way and he was released, bruised and scratched to be sure - but safe! On another occasion Laurs was sent to drive a team of horses and covered wagon carrying some supplies from Manti to the settlement of Ephraim, some six or more miles north. As far as we know he was alone on this trip. When he came within a mile or so of his destination his attention was drawn to the foothills on his right where he could see some horsemen approaching in a cloud of dust. It wasn't a moment until the wild whooping of the riders struck him with stark fright - "Injuns!" -- there was no mistake. Quickly he tied the lines to the wagon box or seat somehow and slipped down onto the wagon tongue between the then thoroughly frightened horses, trying to calm them and yet urging them on faster and faster in almost one and the same breath. Soon the Indians came within range, pulled their bows and let fly in his direction, piercing the wagon box cover and drivers seat over and over in a rhythmic tattoo of arrows. From his hidden, awkward position Laurs could also hear the arrows whizzing over the backs of the animals above his head. A merciful heaven must have been on guard that day for he and the team reached the outskirts of Ephraim and safety, unscathed by the redmen's darts. Although Laurs was cramped, lame and in <span id="page-228"></span>a state of shock, he recovered and was soon returned to his home and family again, safe and sound in the main. If Else fussed and worried over him and his narrow escapes he probably passed it off in such a manner, -_ "There's no need to be afraid my dear! Haven't I told you time and again that no Injun buck will ever wear my curly-haired scalp?"

* * * * *

There were sometimes things more to be dreaded than Indians. In July of that year, just when the new crops began looking most promising, grasshoppers came in clouds so thick as to darken the air. They ate everything green and growing in
their paths. They were particularly bad in Sanpete Valley for a period of two or three weeks. Men, women and children were called out every day en masse to fight with shovels, brooms, switches, aprons - anything they could wield to try and kill them or drive them away. When the 'hoppers were finally gone there was little left of the crops. A food shortage was bound to follow. But pigweeds grew profusely near Temple Hill and dandelions too - both made tasty nourishing greens. Young milkweed stalks seemed as good creamed as asparagus. Dainty Sego Lillies, called "Lanterns of the Fairies" by the pioneers, grew quite abundantly on the foothills near Manti. Their bulbs could be dug up and eaten raw, cooked, or ground into meal for bread making. All these helped out many a dire food situation in those early days

If Else was worried, fretful, and not quite her sweet, courageous self that summer and fall of 1867, she had some reason to be for she was expecting a little one. Anne was expecting also and both were hoping for sons, as were their respective husbands. Christen especially wanted a son, which was quite understandable with so many girls in his household already. The two women spun and sewed and made little quilts and garments together and talked of their coming confinements; neither knowing which would be first. Anne, though older, was as unaccustomed to childbirth as Else; to both of them it was a mystery <span id="page-229"></span> fathomed only by the experienced. As their times drew nearer a midwife was approached and spoken for. In the meantime the fathers-to-be doubtless fashioned small wooden cradles and dreamed betimes of their unborn sons. Maren had consented to do the cooking and extras for the two households besides looking after her three young sisters, while Anne was lying-in, although she and Lars Myrup had hoped to go north with the Conference goers that October to see the magnificent new Tabernacle in which the meetings were to be held for the first time. It was to be a glorious occasion. Everyone said the new structure, 250 feet long, 150 feet wide and 68 feet from floor to ceiling, with its immense roof arched without a pillar, and its great pipe organ, was one of the wonders of the world.

Sat. 28 Sept. 1867, Christen and Anne's child was born, a healthy baby girl whom they decided to name Caroline. This was Christen's eleventh child and seventh daughter but only Anne's first. Six days later, 4th of Oct., in another one-roomed log cabin within the confines of the Big Fort in Manti, Else presented Laurs with a curly-haired son. Why Laurs got the son and his father another daughter 'tis hard to tell. Perhaps he remembered to sleep with an ax under his bed while Christen forgot. It should be comparatively easy to remember the date of the little boy's birth, since it was just two days before the October General Conference convened in Salt Lake City, at which time the new Tabernacle was dedicated, 6 Oct. 1867. Laurs and Else decided to name their boy Christian. Baby Christian was undoubtedly given his name and blessing on Fast Sunday in November at a meeting in the Council House on the Tabernacle Block. Petrine Christensen was likely confirmed there also following her baptism, since she turned eight in Manti that year of 1867.

At General Conference in Salt Lake City that October, other business besides the dedication of the new Tabernacle was taken care of: 163 missionaries were called to strengthen the settlements in southern Utah, and all the Saints in Zion were called upon to assist liberally the following <span id="page-230"></span>year towards emigrating all the poor Saints from Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries. No church teams had been sent to the Missouri River for the poor that year, because of the Indian trouble, in consequence of which the immigration of members to Zion was comparatively small. Anne was anxious to send money to her sister in Denmark so that she might come, and Christen promised to get around to it as soon as he got his feet on his own ground. Lars Myrup too was eager to have his father and step-mother and their children come; but it turned out to be many years before this was accomplished. Else's thoughts must also have turned to her people in Jutland. But it was useless to think of them in connection with the church, or any other way now for that matter. Not until she could tell of something besides poverty and hardships would she even bother to write them, for she was proud and they would be slow to understand such things. Yet the call of home reached out to her in voices unstilled by time and space.

It was known that Chief Black Hawk, who had gained for himself the title of the "Red Marauder", had been gravely wounded at the battle of Gravelly Ford in June 1866 but it was rumored that more recently he had contracted tuberculosis and in his weakened condition was loath to continue the hard life he had been pursuing. In the fall of 1867 he indicated he wanted to make peace. At a meeting with Colonel Head, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the Uintah Indian reservation, he unbosomed himself, again expressed a desire for peace and asked Superintendent Head to cut his hair for him in token of his abandonment of the warpath, and promised to induce as many as possible of his adherents to join him in peace. Preliminaries having been accomplished, the proud Chieftain seemed anxious to make amends to the people of Utah before death overtook him.

Thus, on April 5, 1868, believing Indian hostilities were over and that it was safe to return to their deserted homes, a company of 22 men, 4 boys and 15 wagons started on their way to re-open the settlement of Monroe in Sevier County. They had been cautioned against possible Indian attacks <span id="page-231"></span>however. Early in the afternoon they found they were being followed by Indians, so immediately corraled their animals to prevent a stampede and prepared for the worst. The Indians dismounted and took to the cedars which formed a kind of horseshoe bend around the place. From this point they fired upon the company, killing Lars A. Justesen, a Danish emigrant. After two hours of fighting the Indians returned to the hillside. Riders were sent out to Gunnison and Richfield for help but the Indians pursued them and succeeded in severely wounding Adolph Thomson. When word reached Gunnison a party of twenty-nine men went immediately to their assistance. They also came upon the body of Charles Wilson, who had been murdered by the Indians near the scene of the other attack.

So in spite of Black Hawk the war continued, although the renegade Indians who kept at it in Sanpete and Sevier did not make as many attacks as the previous years. The energy and vigilance of the militia had their effects upon these wily foe and they saw their prospects of raids in safety and success fading. But accustomed as they were by now to feasting on the cattle of the settlers, many grew fretful at having to stay within the safe limits of their strongholds subsisting on crickets, grasshoppers and an occasional game animal. So some continued their raids - safe or not. Especially the young chiefs and sub-chieftains were rebellious and defiant and boasted not a little of their prowess and deeds of blood. These young warriors were loath to "bury the tomahawk" or eat humble pie by creeping back into the good graces of Uncle Sam and the settlers as Chief Black Hawk had done. Also, in the south, north and east, the Shiberetch, Capotah and Elk Mountain Indian bands, as well as the turbulent, Navajos, were still on the warpath and troops were kept on scouting expeditions against them. All in all the Indians continued to make things sufficiently distressing for the settlers most of the year 1868.

It was a strange paradox that while the settlers continued their war against the redmen on the one hand, they were earnestly laboring to <span id="page-232"></span>make peace with them on the other. Treaties were signed with various Indian leaders here and there, even though they continued to be broken by the redmen and perhaps some whites. Yet progress towards peace in the valleys was being made notwithstanding. One of the most important treaty meetings for the people of Sanpete, save the one with Chief Black Hawk the year before, was held in Strawberry Valley, Uinta Co. in August 1868. Here Superintendent F. H. Head again met with Black Hawk, but this time the Chief had a number of his sub-chiefs with him. They had a "heap big talk" which lasted nearly all one day. The talk ended in the signing of a peace treaty by the whites and Chiefs Augavorum (the White Horse Chief) Tamarita and Sowahpoint and a few others, urged on by Black Hawk.

In Sanpete at Ephraim a few days later, negotiations were continued and details of the peace worked out. In attendance in the town's bowery were the above named chieftains as well as Black Hawk, numerous young Indian braves and quite a group of white settlers. The fact that some of the redmen came with their faces painted black, war clubs slung on their wrists and pistols hidden under their blankets lent a rather eerie effect to the scene. Apostle Orson Hyde, an emmissary of peace for the Church, presided and the boastful, insolent White Horse Chief acted as spokesman for his red brethren. In eloquent defiance and with much disdain he made his accusations and demands, often with contemptuous gestures, but the whites refused to be ruffled. At length their cool diplomacy, together with Black Hawk's encouragement, overcame the resistance of the assembled Indians. At last the party moved to a nearby lawn where the Indians seated themselves in a circle and passed around the pipe of peace. Hundreds of dollars worth of blankets, gay calico, tobacco, trinkets and other articles were distributed to the eager Utes as the price of peace. Thus the treaty was concluded and comparative quiet settled upon the valley.

<span id="page-233"></span>The Christensens had been looking forward to October General Conference that year. It was to be quite an occasion for Christen and Anne as they planned to have their endowments and be sealed to one another for time and eternity in the Salt Lake Endowment House while in the city. Maren and Lars Myrup had been thinking about it also, but again they were deprived of going because they had a tiny daughter of their own and were loath to leave her in another's care. The little girl had been born five weeks following her mother's nineteenth birthday, 22 Mar. 1868, in the Myrup's log cabin in the Big Fort. They had taken her to Fast Meeting in the Council House for her blessing and given her the name of Mary, the American name for Maren. It is doubtful if Laurs and Else went along that year either, with young Christen just a year old and crawling into everything. They must have cared for little Caroline also, to leave Anne and Christen free, and probably helped with the girls too, since Maren must have had her hands full with little Mary.

Christen and Anne went to Salt Lake by covered wagon, along with a company of other Conference-goers. You may be sure they had an armed escort along, as skirmishes, stock thefts and even killings continued, even after the treaties were signed. Though there was supposed to be peace, no wise settlers ever traveled about unprotected; it didn't pay to take the chance. The company left Manti early since it still took almost a week to get from there to Salt Lake City. On Sat. Oct. 5th, in the Endowment House, Christen and Anne were given their endowments and sealed to each other. The gentle Karen, Christen's first wife, was also sealed to him for eternity, although her endowments had to be postponed until a temple was erected in Zion in which to do work for the dead. General Conference convened next day, Oct. 6th, in the new Tabernacle and lasted three days. It was the first time a full quorum of Apostles was ever present at a Conference in Utah. Apostles Franklin D. Richards and Charles W. Penrose having just arrived in Salt Lake from their foreign missions. It is likely that Brother <span id="page-234"></span>Penrose's hymn "O Ye Mountains High" was featured at this Conference.

If April Conference the following year, 1869, was considered by Laurs and Else, the idea came to nothing since Else was expecting again and too near the time to take a chance on so long a journey. On June 6 that year she gave birth to another fine son. He too was born in their log cabin home in the Big Fort at Manti; for though some people were now moving out of the fort and building homes on their own adjoining farms, yet a number of the Scandinavians planned to move on farther south as soon as Indian troubles became a bit more settled, and among these were the Christensens. So they remained on in the Big Fort for awhile longer. This baby must also have been christened in the Council House at Manti. He was given the name of Andrew, American for Anders, after Else's father. Can't we just see Else cuddling the wee one, as twenty-months-old Christian clung to her skirts, vying for attention?

Andrew was born just twenty-one days following the laying of the last rail and driving of the last spike (gold) that joined the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, completing the Great Pacific Railroad into Utah. This long hoped for event took place at Promontory Point near Ogden, 10 May 1869. No more were church wagon trains sent east to the big rivers to bring in the immigrating Saints since they could now come all-the-way-to-Zion-in-comfort (or so 'twas advertised). Right away ground was broken for the start of the Utah Central Railway, a branch road to be built from Ogden to Salt Lake City. Later on other railway systems, including the Utah Southern Railroad, Denver and Rio Grande, etc., were built to other parts of the Territory. Numbers of the settlers were given employment on these projects as time went on, helping them to supplement their incomes and giving them other means with which to barter and trade, besides their livestock and farm produce. Thus the coming of the railroad to Utah brought prosperity along with it, and "business began to boom".

Yet things were anything but "booming" for <span id="page-235"></span>the Christensens, Myrups and some others of the Scandinavian immigrants then living in Manti, for they had not yet become firmly settled in Zion. These were still waiting for the cessation of Indian troubles, or at least for the time when they themselves could feel safe in moving farther south and taking up land. Skirmishes, stock thefts, and even killings had gone on. Even as late as 26 Sept. 1872, when Daniel Miller was killed and his son Dan Jr, wounded near Bernard Snow's mill not far from Spring City, Sanpete County, where the two had gone for lumber, were the Indians still to be feared. Though this incident was considered by some to be the finale of the Black Hawk Indian War, it was well nigh impossible to tell just when this war really ended.

It had been a costly one for the young Territory. It was estimated that, counting the loss of livestock, expense of military supplies and services, as well as the breaking up and re-establishing of numerous settlements, the cost had run to more than one-and-a-half million dollars during the four years 1865-1869. Looking back on it, some concluded that a bale of blankets and a few sacks of flour here and there, distributed to the redmen in the proper season, might have accomplished more than their weight in gold expended in military operations. Would the people then never learn about the ways of peace and war? However, these early settlers learned teamwork and cooperation through it all. There were many fine examples of sacrificial giving which helped to unite these people in a bond of brotherhood and common ideals. 

The last incidents of this destructive war were carried out by renegade Indians and in no way involved Chief Black Hawk. When he signed the peace treaty and persuaded his sub-chiefs and braves to do likewise, he was determined to have no more to do with war and the killing of whites, and he stuck to it. To prove this he decided to visit every town and settlement where his warriors had caused trouble or raided, in an effort to "make peace with the people". So he obtained permission from the proper authorities to do this. <span id="page-236"></span>Thus, sometime before his death, with a few of his warriors and a military escort, the notorious Black Hawk visited every town and village from Cedar City on the south to Payson on the north, in an attempt to make peace with the whites and win their forgiveness. A revealing account has been given of his visit to Fillmore, in Millard County, the latter part of April 1870, when he appeared at a Sunday meeting before a highly expectant audience"

"With head erect and dignified steps, as unperturbed as a white General, Black Hawk, preceeded by the Bishop, marched to the platform and was seated. After preliminary exercises he was introduced and the object of his presence stated. Personified dignity in every movement and gesture, the Pah-Ute Chief deliberately arose and avoiding the pulpit, stood on the side of the platform near his interpreter and spoke exclusively in Pah-Ute, although he could speak English quite well. The slowly dying chieftain rapidly rehearsed the story of his early grievances: -- how the white invaders had taken possession of the hunting and fishing grounds of his ancestors; of the insolence of some of the white men and of the whipping and occasional killing of some of his warriors. The speaker seemed to have few regrets for his raids in Sanpete and Sevier. He denied complicity in some of the murders of which he had been accused and expressed sorrow over others, saying that the raids were forced by the starvation of his people and that, had he been so inclined, every white man, woman and child could have been massacred. He concluded his speech with a not too repentant plea
for forgiveness.

"The Bishop then moved a vote of forgiveness of their late enemy, who was preparing to meet the 'Great Spirit', and requested that the audience express their views. On the stand was the father-in-law of Samuel Brown who, together with Bishop Josiah Call, had been murdered in the late '50's by Indians. He broke the suspense by speaking briefly against the motion. Then suddenly, turning on the redman, he shouted, 'You black murderer, you killed Bishop Call, the best friend the Indians <span id="page-237"></span>ever had, and you murdered Sam Brown for the money he was carrying - you black devil! I will NOT forgive you.' But to this the once dreaded Chieftain never 'batted an eye'. A voice vote was then taken - one grim 'NO' and the Chieftain once known as 'The Red Marauder' was absolved from mortal responsibility for his active belief in the ancient law 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'".

It has been said that at his best Black Hawk was a fine looking Chief, his appearance being different from that of the other chiefs. He was tall and wore long feathers. His nose was long and he wore a small moustache and looked as if he had Jewish blood in him. He also had three nice looking squaws. But Black Hawk was not at his best physically during the last years of his life. It must be remembered that he had been wounded in battle in 1866 and that tuberculosis had set in sometime after and was taking its toll. He knew that it wouldn't be too long before he would be going home to die, and before the end came he desired to be at peace with the pale faces. The proud Black Hawk's repentance may have been brought about by his weakening condition, but on the other hand it may have been forced by mental anguish. As he began losing his health and strength, the once powerful Indian must have recalled again and again a long-gone meeting with the "Great White Chief" Brigham Young, to which he had been summoned in an attempt to get him to walk the ways of peace. In surly contempt he had paid the Mormon leader no heed, even after he had leveled his finger at him and uttered these prophetic words;-- "If you continue to shed the blood of Mormons you shall wither and die!"

No one can tell the exact date that Black Hawk went home to his wigwam and gave up his life to join his fathers and the Great Spirit in a better land. Nor can anyone now living tell just when he was buried in his Spring Lake Villa south of Payson in Utah County. But before he died he became a living skeleton, having wasted away to almost nothing. He knew it was because he had killed the white men. That he was a red man of <span id="page-238"></span>some courage cannot be denied, and begging forgiveness of the whites, or "eating humble pie" as the Indians called it, undoubtedly took as much courage as all the battles he had ever fought put together. Lightly flint-tipped arrows, heavily feathered for long range shooting, heavily-tipped, lightly feathered ones for short range, and sometimes poisoned arrows tipped with venom from the fangs of the rattlesnake, were among Chief Black Hawk's earthly weapons; but in the land of the "Happy Hunting Ground" -- who knows...?

* * * * *

As the year 1869 drew to a close in Manti the big drums seldom beat out warnings anymore and the Indian warwhoops had mostly ceased; but the sensations connected with those beating drums and blood-curdling yells must have lived with the settlers the remainder of their lives. For the majority of the Utah pioneers the 1,100 mile trek from the Missouri River had not been too unpleasant, with some exceptions such as the Abner Lowry Company. Solving the problems of settlement and establishing home in an unconquered wilderness was the really great challenge - the supreme test of their ability and integrity. To stop in the middle of settling and fight an Indian war had been demanding. Three thousand young men had been on call for military duty and served without pay. Those who stayed at home had furnished food, weapons, ammunition, horses, saddles and other equipment. Muster rolls and other expenditures had been compiled, for it was expected that the national government would reimburse the settlers for the time and money spent, but it did not. The one-and-a-half million dollar cost of the war was largely met by individual sacrifice. Even the smaller settlements were allotted their share of the expense plus what they suffered in loss of cattle and horses. Thus for some time many were in an impoverished condition. The need for sharing worldly goods was not over until well after the war.

The Christensens and Myrups, intent upon moving to a less crowded area, had their hearts set on Gunnison, approximately fifteen miles southwest of Manti. Some of their Danish friends <span id="page-239"></span>were already settled there and prospects for them taking up land in that settlement were said to be very good. It was virtually believed that Indian raiding and killing were over, at least while the winter snow barricaded the canyons, keeping the redmen out of the valleys. Preparations were gotten underway in their various households but there was one thing more that they were awaiting before they left Manti. This event took place on the eve of Christmas, 24 Dec. 1869, when Anne presented Christen with a long-awaited son. It was quite natural that they should choose the name of Christen for this new child, in honor of his father but perhaps also in memory of the other son Christen who had stayed behind in Old Denmark.

## SINKING ROOTS IN GUNNISON VALLEY

Whether it was the forepart of January 1870, as soon as Anne and the new baby were able, or later on that year, when the three families hoisted their belongings into their white-topped wagons and headed south we cannot be quite certain. Early Gunnison Ward records give the following: "Lars (Laurs) M. C. Christensen, son of Christen Christensen and Karen Lauritzen, born 22 July 1847 in Kobberod, Tyland (Thyland) Denmark; bapt. 8 May 1865 by Lars N. Myrup; confirmed same day by same; received Gunnison 1st month 1870." But Laurs and Else, with their two sons, are recorded as still living in Manti at the taking of the U. S. Census there 25 June 1870. It is possible that Christen and Lars Myrup and their families went along in the early part of the year and Laurs and his family came later on in 1870.
Whenever they went that year, however, it was likely with a cow tied to each ox-drawn wagon, and penned up inside somehow some chickens and perhaps a pig, with a few sheep being driven alongside. Picture our Danish kinsfolk as they traveled along thus, varying in ages from 52-year-old Christen and 31-year-old Anne, to two-year-old Caroline and a few-weeks-old Christen. Lars Myrup was pressing 25 and Maren, expecting again soon, was almost 21, while small Mary <span id="page-240"></span> was a year and ten months. Laurs 22 &frac12; and Else, just short of 23, had two-year-old Christian and seven-month-old Anders to keep contented. Then there were the three girls who were growing up indeed, for Pauline was a young lady of nearly 15, Petrine almost 11 and Nielsine (Sena) 7 &frac12;.

From Manti around the Red Point and past Warm Springs to Six Mile, then on to Nine Mile, from thence they continued south, turning west before reaching the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek where it joined the Sanpitch River. Then they wended their way across the meadow road following the course of the Sanpitch as it ran to meet the Sevier River west of Gunnison. Long chains of high hills watched in the distance, craggy crimson peaks jutting sharply at intervals. To the east, towering above the nearby White Hills, were the majestic Wasatch Mountains. Far to the west, lofty blue mountains made a backdrop for grey hills while nearby, a little to the south, stood Chalk Hill with its varying shades of beige, buff and yellow. On all sides were expanses of sage and rabbit brush, denoting the fertility of the soil. So, the Christensens and Myrups came to the little town of Gunnison prepared to sink their roots in the valley and make the most of their inheritance in their "Promised Land".

Gunnison, first settled in 1859, was named in memory of a wonderful friend of the Mormons, Captain John William Gunnison, U. S. topographical engineer, who was killed by Indians near the Sevier Lake in 1853. Captain Gunnison once wrote his observations of the Great Basin and its inhabitants in expressions such as the following: "In these contiguous vales are the gardens of the mountains, located in that remarkable depression styled the Great Basin - out of which no water flows ... The atmosphere is light, and breathing is a real luxury. From the canyons the breezes at night are ever fresh and strong. . . The cheerful, happy faces and the strains of music pouring forth from merry hearts give an impression of a happy society. . . The ascending sun salutes, and descending bids a short farewell each day, kissing the snow-capt brow of the lofty peeks that look so <span id="page-240a"></span>

serenely down upon these vales filled with happy homes of peaceful industry. . . The dignity of labor is held sacred by the Saints, they teach by example what they preach on the Sabbath. . ."

The very first group of settlers coming into Gunnison Valley had settled south of the Sanpitch River where it curved abruptly to the west around Chalk Hill point. The second group who came some months later saw the luxuriant, grassy bottoms between the Sanpitch and the Sevier and so, north and west of the other group, they began a new settlement below a long curve in the Sanpitch and south of little white hill ledge. They called this "Kearns Camp", "Sevier City Rocky Point" and "Hogwallow" in turn. Their fields were laid out in eighty-acre blocks with roads four rods wide between them. These blocks were then divided into ten acre lots and each settler was allotted his share according to the size of his family. The first temporary shelters were dugouts, usually 12 by 16 feet, made deep in warm mother earth and covered with willows and sagebrush plastered with mud. A fireplace with a chimney sticking tall above the ground was built in one end of each and in the other end a ramp or steps led down to the door or entrance. Nearly all the cooking was done from pots suspended from fireplaces fed by fat pine wood, whose light was a fine substitute for candles. Furniture was made of slabs, poles, split logs or broken wagon boxes. Clothing was sometimes made from tents, sacks or bed ticks, and making over from large to smaller was a common task. Rawhide or buckskin, secured from the Indians, was used for making harnesses, shoes, bed cords and even fences. For mending, leather was used for almost everything including broken wagons and machinery. The work to be done was accomplished cooperatively, making ditches, planting and harvesting crops, making roads and building bridges, cutting, and hauling wood and logs for houses were some of the major jobs to begin with. Soon log cabins were built and then the dugouts became milk cellars and storage pits. The children worked at picking berries, digging sego roots, or gathering succulent weeds to cook as greens. The women sometimes <span id="page-242"></span> sheared the sheep and carded, spun and wove the wool or knitted stockings from it. They made nearly all the family clothing from cloth of their own making. "Do it yourself" projects were the only kind in those days in early Gunnison.

In the spring of 1861, Elder Orson Hyde, who was presiding over that area, advised the two groups of settlers to move together. Those from Chalk Hill agreed to move to the lower site. During the winter of 1861-1862 a great amount of snow fell in the mountains and when it melted in the spring the streams and rivers were swollen by it and overflowed their banks in many places. The settlers "turned out en masse and built a dam" to divert the water away from their homes and keep it from swallowing up the colony. Nevertheless, the ground became soaked and soggy, cellars filled with water, chimneys fell down, and the whole place became nothing much but a "hog-wallow". When President Brigham Young and his company came through there by ox-train that September, he was shocked by the condition of the land and advised the Saints to move east onto the bench and there build a permanent city to be called "Gunnison."

Without delay the new townsite was laid out in eight-acre oblong blocks, with wide roads between - 24 regular blocks and 54 fractions. Main Street (now Center Street) ran east to above town and west to Second West, then North. Before winter set in some families had already moved to the new location and by the summer of 1863 all fifty families of which the place boasted had taken up their new residences. All public buildings from "the hollow" were moved onto the bench, including the meeting and school house which had been dedicated on Christmas Day 1861. Built of logs which had been sawed through at Lewis Bunce's mill, and whitewashed on the inside with clay from Chalk Hill, this 20 by 40 ft. room, with a door between two windows on one side, spacious rock chimneys at each end, a floor of boards, together with benches of slabs and a pine wood table, not only served for church and school in its new location, but dancing and festivals as well.
<span id="page-243"></span>
In May or June 1866 word was sent from Brigham Young for the Gunnison settlers to move their cabins in line for outside walls of a fort. No sooner said than begun. Four blocks, numbers 13, 14, 20 and 21 (with the middle intersection at today's 2nd West on Center Street) were enclosed. Walls between the cabins were rocked up to a height of seven feet with peepholes near the top. At each corner circular structures with many peepholes served as lookouts for the watchmen. There was a substantial gate on each side in line with the cross streets. A standing guard was maintained night and day. West, on Rocky Point, a great pile of straw was heaped up ready for firing as a warning should any red men be sighted. Boys too young to stand guard ran errands and carried food and water to the men on duty. 

In the spring of 1867, when the Indians renewed their shocking brutality, all of the settlements on the Sevier River south of Gunnison had been evacuated and many of the evacuees were welcomed to Fort Gunnison, though some chose other settlements farther north. The people from the area of Fayette to the north moved their log cabin homes into Gunnison Fort also. At this time President Brigham Young advised the building of a more substantial fortification at Gunnison. Militiamen at once commenced work on what was designed to be a splendid structure, surrounding the fort and enclosing twelve city blocks. The two-story northeast tower of rock, circular in form, reached a height of about thirteen feet, the tapering walls of which, four feet thick at the base, had small openings to shoot through. This fortification was never finished, for the need for it subsided before it could be fully accomplished. 

Settlers came from both north and south to Fort Gunnison and as they came, they were welcomed and room provided for them, even houses built. Many of the military from the north were stationed there from time to time. A few stories that have come down to us from life in Gunnison Fort would not be amiss here. "After a few weeks living within its walls, a letter was sent to President Wells (head of the Mormon Battalion in Utah) <span id="page-244"></span> asking permission to have the 'Kraals', Pig Stys and sheep pens outside the fort to keep it from becoming disagreeably unsanitary", which was granted we suppose. Albert Tollestrup's diary contains these excerpts: "We children would go through the big gate down to Sanpitch River just one block away. With pin hooks and thread lines we fished for minnows. We brought some home to fry but we also ate some raw Injun fashion. 'Sunflower Hole' and 'Big Roundy' were swimming holes close by and a mile west of Rocky Point was 'Izen Glass Hole' where we caught water snakes and blue racers. In a puddle nearby there was good clay out of which we made horsemen and Indians and put them on the rocks to dry. It was fun to climb to the top of 'picket guard' on Rocky Point. We could see the Sevier River, the White Hills, and all over town and away to Fayette, Willow Creek and Salina." "When Hans C. Hansen was a small child, he was playing alone outside the fort walls one day. An Indian picked him up and took him to his lodge. Hans' mother saw the Indian take him and followed anxiously after them. When she reached the wickiup the Indian was giving Hans a pair of moccasins. Luckily the Indian was a friendly one and she was able to take the boy and hurry home. Hans liked the moccasins and was allowed to keep them." Sometimes people were not so fortunate. White children were occasionally stolen and never found; at other times they were kidnapped by the Indians and redeemed after a lapse of time in payment for food, blankets and anything the minds of the red men could think up.

In the early spring of 1869, the Gunnison people moved their cabins out of the fort and onto their own city lots, set out fruit trees, planted gardens and started many improvements in an effort to beautify their abodes. In April they decided to start a co-op store in the settlement. ZCMI in Salt Lake City had merchandise available for such projects, so Bishop Horne went north to get a load of goods. When he returned there was much excitement in the town, but the little house or store wasn't ready for the wares, so they were sold from the wagon. In two days, the store building was ready, but the goods had all <span id="page-245"></span> been sold, so the Bishop went to Salt Lake for another load. Other peacetime projects were planned and a committee worked out the following seven point program: "(1) Division of the wire grass bottoms, a lot to each family; (2) A system of irrigation where needed and drainage for flag-grass areas; (3) A schedule of labor to accomplish the work; (4) Burning of old grass; (5) Survey of lots and leveling of ditches; (6) Fencing; (7) Sowing of improved red-top seed."

*****

Upon taking up their residence in Gunnison, Laurs and Else and their two small children were eventually assigned a lot on what is now (1969) about the end of Third West on First South. Soon a small adobe house facing south was erected there and later plastered white on the outside. (It is still standing today.) Laurs must have also been given some grazing land in the "bottoms" for his stock, as well as some farming land somewhere on which to begin planting. Assignments of labor for him in that cooperative society, however, were definitely not relegated to the days ahead but must have been given right away and started as soon as his family had been made reasonably comfortable. It is supposed that the grubbing of brush and clearing of his own acres was not long delayed either. There is indication that Christen Christensen and Lars Myrup were given lots in east Gunnison. Thus, these and other Scandinavian immigrants, who in general had been reckoned to be rather poor pioneers, settled down to become fine grassroot settlers in the valleys of the mountains.

In the summer of 1870 Hans Thunnison, postmaster of Gunnison, sent the following report to the Deseret News in Salt Lake City: -- "We have but a small settlement of 90 families. The grasshoppers preyed heavily upon us the last years. The losses sustained from them and the burdens we have had to endure during the Black Hawk War were equally severe - but we are improving. Our fields at present look barren and desolate except about 250 acres planted mostly with late wheat which looks very promising and will, we hope, suffice to feed the inhabitants of this place for the <span id="page-246"></span> coming year, with the addition of peas, potatoes, corn, etc., all of which appear to be doing well. A new rock schoolhouse, 24 x 24 feet, will soon be finished. With the good road now made up Twelve Mile Canyon we expect a good supply of lumber. The people seem to be well generally, the weather is fine and as soon as the grasshoppers get wings they take their fight to other parts."

Time and events must have passed swiftly for the Christensens and Myrups in Gunnison the next few years, for when people are well and working busily towards desired goals and succeeding to some extent it is hard to keep track of the minutes as they fly. Additions to the three families seemed to have come along as fast as anything. On 1 March 1870 Maren gave birth to her first son. He was a tiny little fellow and they named him Lars Christian Myrup after his father. (Later they changed his name to Louis). A little more than a year later, 7 March 1871, Else presented Laurs with his third son and they named him for the Prophet Joseph. His hair was curly like his father's and grandfather's and also like his brother,
Christian's, though he was lighter complexioned than Christian. March 29, 1872, Maren had another son whom they named Niels Christian Myrup, also for his father whose full name was Lars Christian Nielsen Myrup. Not to be outdone, Anne presented Christen with another son on 26 April 1872. They gave him the name of John Taylor Christensen in honor of the Apostle.

In the late autumn of 1871, Laurs and Else made their first trip back to Salt Lake City. It must have taken at least a week each way, for although Gunnison was only 1491 miles from Salt Lake at the time, travel, with roads like they were, was pretty slow even with a good team of horses. Too, they had to stop along the way to camp at nights, as well as other times to rest, water and feed their animals, carrying that feed along with them, and to prepare their own victuals or "grub", the makings of which they also took along stowed away in grub boxes likely under the seat of the wagon. Did they take along their sons Christian, just turned four, Andrew two years and <span id="page-247"></span> four months, and seven-month-old Joseph? 'Tis most likely that they did and also that they were accompanied by a number of other wagon loads of Saints, since it was still not considered entirely safe to travel alone or in a small group, for fear of Indians.

The main purpose of this trip, as far as Laurs and Else were concerned, was to enjoy the great privilege of going to the Salt Lake Endowment House and being sealed as man and wife for time and all eternity. This sacred event took place 30 October 1871. There in Salt Lake City just prior to this, or on 28 October, Laurs was ordained an Elder in the LDS Church. No sealings of children to parents could be rightly performed until temples were prepared in Utah to take care of those and other holy ordinances. After having been sealed in the Endowment House Else and Laurs, if they remained true to the covenants made at that time, would be considered worthy to partake of other blessings in the House of the Lord, when one
should be provided, such as having their three first born sealed to them for all eternity and also to have the holy ordinances of baptism, endowment and sealing done for their dead relatives.

Else must have been forcefully reminded of this latter obligation when she received word of her mother's death sometime after it occurred. Mette Kirstine Christensdatter (Hvid) died 11 July 1872 in Norhaa, Thisted, Denmark at the age of 61 years, 3 months and 8 days. However, there is some indication that correspondence and communication between her and her loved ones in the old country was not carried on regularly, in fact hardly at all, until many years after her mother's passing. Else's heart must have yearned to see her father and comfort him then, but she was helpless to go. Surely though she wrote her family words of love and consolation - and wept betimes in longing to be near them in their mutual sorrow.

In that year of 1872 another uprising of Indians threatened, particularly in Sanpete. Several Utah Indian Chieftains were taken to Washington, D. C. to meet with United States <span id="page-248"></span> President Ulysses Simpson Grant, where they must have promised that the uprisings would cease, for they did, in Utah at least, from then on. Yet notwithstanding the possible danger from redmen, and doubtless leaving their two small sons with Else or Anne, Lars and Maren Myrup left Gunnison that midsummer and traveled to Salt Lake City by team and wagon. There in the Salt Lake Endowment House, 15 July 1872, they had their endowments and were sealed together for time and eternity. These holy ordinances were so important to the majority of the early Saints that they were willing to sacrifice a great deal to have them accomplished. Lars Myrup was fast becoming a man of some consequence in the community of Gunnison. He had a way with people, especially the Scandinavian brothers and sisters who looked to him for leadership.

On Friday, 13 December 1872, Else Christensen gave birth to her fourth son. He was the first of their children to be born under the covenant and their first and only "winter" baby. He and Joseph were each born in the small adobe house on First South, Third West. They had this fourth son, Albert Christen Christensen, blessed and named by Bishop Joseph S. Horne, 2 January 1873.

Christen's eighteen-year-old daughter, Pauline, was wed to Andrew Andersen of Gunnison, also a native of Denmark, 12 May 1873. Their endowments were had and their marriage consumated in the Salt Lake Endowment House. He was nearly seven-and-a-half years older than she. That same year, railroad building in Utah took a spurt. By 25 November, the Utah Southern Railroad had reached as far south as Provo, where a great celebration was held that day. A railroad in a town ended its semi-isolation and made easy contact with the outside world available--thus there was cause for rejoicing. Railroad building was also a boon to the settlers in other ways, increasing their incomes through contracts getting out lumber for ties, etc., as well as for opportunities to labor on the projects outright.

Else Kathrine always had an intense love for education which is indicated in her son Albert's <span id="page-249"></span> account of her given in his autobiography, from which we quote: "... As soon as arriving in the United States she set about to learn to read English, and while it was difficult to learn the language, she succeeded in being able to read and understand it in a very short time. Needless to say, she was exceedingly energetic in assuming the household responsibilities, but aside from that she always took an independent interest in public matters, and especially in the health of the people in the community and in the education of her children. The two older boys were taught early to read so that when they first attended school, they were able to commence in what was then called 'the third reader'. After her general housework was done she usually engaged in carding and spinning, and each day the children took their turns at the side of the spinning wheel and had their lessons in reading. While she was unable at first to pronounce the words so that in that way she was not only the teacher, but was also taught the pronunciation of English words. This love of education and improvement was one of her outstanding characteristics." The women all helped each other according to their special talents. Cheerful cooperation made the many working bees - sewing, quilting, rug-making, apple drying, squash drying, corn husking, etc., - into social events. Else was an excellent mixer for she was always sympathetic and willing to "go the extra mile".

The Christensen family clothing was mostly fashioned from cloth of her own making or that was exchanged for sick duty and such. Excellent trousers for little boys could be made from seamless sacks and straw hats by picking out the finest straw, soaking it in water until it could be braided and then shaped over a pot or bowl to dry. Most small children were scantily dressed in summers and ran without shoes. Hand-loomed and hand-sewn clothing lasted a long time and could be passed down, or made over, sometimes for generations. Women's shoes were often made from any coarse cloth that they could find. Some were fortunate enough to procure leather moccasins from friendly Indians for a bit of wheat or flour. Brigham Young once told the early settlers that if <span id="page-250"></span> they would wear wooden-soled shoes most would be free from rheumatics, or "rheumatiz".

When Laurs first came to the valley he had gotten down to nothing but white shirts and had been forced to wear them to work in until more practical ones could be made for him. Thus, he gained for himself the title "Chris of the White Shirt". He was a hard worker, steadfast, dependable and so very honest. Though naturally a somewhat quiet man, he possessed a happy disposition and a natural wit and sense of humor that helped to pull his family over many rough places along the way. He was extremely unselfish and gentle and kind - oh so kind! He never struck one of his children in anger and gave them but very little unnecessary advice. He was immaculate in his personal habits. He had a fine mind and was conservative and deliberate in his decisions and very practical, though at times he may have seemed a little slow in making up his mind. Indeed, Laurs was a splendid balance for a wife such as Else who was sometimes impetuous, impractical and determined - yet withal gifted with great vision, faith and dreams by which she oft was guided. 

The year 1874 was full of experiences both good and bad for the families in Gunnison and the church in general. On 16 July Anne gave Christen another son whom they named Andrew, the same as Laurs' and Else's second. 24 August, Maren had her third son and they named him Adolph Marinus Myrup. So now Anne and Maren each had one daughter followed by three sons, while Else had four sons but no daughters. That she longed for a girl child is easy to believe. July was remarkable for much lightning, thunder and rainstorms. Winds of hurricane proportions belted the area causing much damage and some severe fires.

There was increased anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy movements in Zion and an anti- Mormon weekly newspaper, "Utah Scandinav" began publication in the Danish-Norwegian language that October but was forced to discontinue after three years run. There were numerous excommunications from the church. But, on the other hand, many Indians were converted and baptized into the church that <span id="page-251"></span> year - whole tribes in fact. On July 24th a grand "Juvenile Jubilee" in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City where 4,000 young musicians and singers participated to celebrate the pioneers' entrance into the valley some twenty-seven years before. Work on Utah's first temple was pushed forth with vigor in St. George. One of the most far-reaching and important events of the year, however, was the introduction and organization of the "United Order" principle which took place at the 44th Annual Conference of the Church in Salt Lake City in the forepart of April.

## THE UNITED ORDER EXPERIMENT

In Gunnison the United Order was organized
April 3, 1874. Advice, rules and regulations
printed in circular form were sent out by the
church presidency and apostles. The Order was
reorganized in September and incorporated according 
to law. About 300 persons, men, women and
children in Gunnison, mutually agreed to honestly
and diligently labor for the building up of the Kingdom 
of God and for the salvation of mankind.
"Their object was to create a higher standard of
living, lessen women's labor, better educate the
youth, adopt the best methods of farming agreeable
to location and circumstances, produce as economically 
as possible and assist and divide with
each other until all had plenty of this world's
goods." Committees were appointed for farming,
herding, butchering, merchandising, building,
lumbering, salt boiling, wood hauling, railroad
grading, and shoe, boot and harness making.
Provisions were made for education, music and 
singing. There was a special ways-and-means
committee and one for streets and ditches. Winter
work was threshing grain, logging, lime burning,
rock quarrying and freighting, along with other
pursuits of home industry.

Lars Myrup and his family joined the United
Order in Gunnison and were numbered among the
members there who consecrated their property, 
time and means for the benefit of all concerned.
Evidently Christen and Laurs Christensen and
<span id="page-252"></span>
their families were not among this group who
organized there in September 1874. Whether
they were slow in making up their minds or had
some other reason we do not know. However, by
the end of the year, their problems were apparently
resolved in favor of "The Order" and they were
ready to join forces with that noble 
experiment -- but not in Gunnison, for they had decided to move
elsewhere. Thus, after five years of pioneering 
in Gunnison, Laurs and Else with their four small
sons, together with Christen, Anne, their three
daughters and their three sons, pulled up their
roots and moved again.

* * * * *

As we know, the first inhabitants of Utah
were the so-called "Children of Pride", the dark
skinned people belonging to the mighty Ute Indian
or "Eutaw" nation, from which this state received
its name. The Ute nation was divided into numbers
of powerful tribes, each headed by a chief and
assigned a designated territory or hunting ground
over which it presided. Tribes were often divided
into various Indian bands headed by sub-chieftains.
These Utes were athletic, hardy, impudent and
haughty, exhibiting in their makeup some of the
best and some of the worst traits of character
known to man. Their uncanny skill and courage
made them the best warriors in the west and
between tribes there were always conflict and
wars. It was traditional with them to love and
hate with vigor and so when the whites got in
their way they often took revenge.

When the pioneers first came to the valleys,
"Yakarah", anglicized to Walker, was Chief of
the main Ute tribe in the Territory and one of
many brothers, all said to be of noble birth. Two
of these brothers were Chiefs Sanpitch and Arapeen.
Chief Walker's favorite domain in general was the
Sevier River System, which included the extensive
five county region through which that river flowed;
but he traveled far and wide east and west, hunting
buffalo on the Great Plains, stealing horses by the
hundreds from ranches and Spanish Missions in
California and New Mexico, as well as taking
scalps and prisoners and engaging in slave trade
<span id="page-253"></span>
as he went along extending his power and dominion.
His band of followers, numbering from 500 to 700
braves, were considered the aristocrats of the
Ute Nation and known far and wide for their
excellent horsemanship and their dexterity in
handling firearms. The reputation of Walker
himself excited a variety of opinions. It could
not be agreed as to whether he was good or bad,
though all pronounced him clever. A contemporary
of Brigham Young and much influenced by him in
the long run, Walker joined the Mormon Church
in March 1850 and later was made an Elder. He
eventually signed over much of his territory to the
church. Though he and his braves fought and bled
the settlers in 1853-1854 in what was called "The
Walker War", he repented, we might say, "on his
death bed". Plagued with blindness for three days
before he died, Jan. 25, 1855, he pleaded with his
followers to keep peace with the whites.

Walker's brother, Chief Arapeen, had previously 
laid claim to most of Sanpete Valley, from
Thistle on the north to Salina on the south, but
when Walker died, succeeded him as chief over
all his territory. Arapeen (Siegnerouch) had a
special spot in Sanpete Valley that he loved above
all others and here he made his summer camp.
This beautiful, secluded area, surrounded by hills
and mountains, came to be known as Arapeen
Valley. It was an ideal setting for an Indian village 
and here Arapeen and his band came year
after year in summer, just as his ancestors of
many generations had done before him. Indian
folklore and tradition claim this to have been a
place of "ancient fortifications" -- who knows?

Zig-zagging westward through this valley,
headed for its rendezvous with the Sanpitch River,
ran Twelve Mile Creek, which the Indians knew as 
Aw wan ah voo. On the brink of a hill to the south,
overlooking the creek bottom, Arapeen pitched his
wickiup, below which his people cultivated and
made an "Indian Farm". Here, fed by mountain
and canyon streams, the land provided much to
sustain them besides farm products -- fruit, fish
and game. These Indians jerked meat to preserve
it, and tanned skins of animals with a high degree
<span id="page-254"></span>
of excellence, from which they made their wigwams
and clothing. Arapeen was as devoted to his people
as Chief Walker had been to his and had their welfare 
at heart; thus often bitterly resenting the
encroachment of the whites on the streams and
lands of their fathers.

On the other hand, Arapeen was sometimes
very friendly and looked to the whites for help and
welcomed their assistance. We find him in such
a mood soon after he took over Walker's chiefship.
In May, 1855, he appeared at Manti and said he
believed there was room for all people in the area,
both Indians and whites. Feeling that he was the
rightful owner, as Chief of the Utes, of all the
land of the region, he deeded Sanpete County and
its water, timber and other assets, to Brigham
Young as trustee-in-trust for the Mormon Church,
-- "for and in consideration of the good will I
have to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. . ." The original and complete copy of this
deed, signed by Arapeen (Siegnerouch) with an "X",
and witnessed by George Snow (a son of Gen. Snow),
R, William Glen and John Patten, can be found
today at the Manti City courthouse. Notwithstanding,
Arapeen still claimed ownership at times of different
places in Sanpete, such as Warm Spring and the
grassy meadow near the site of Fayette, which he
bartered off to the first Bartholomews and Mellors
who came there to settle. They gave him two fat
oxen for the spring and some calves for the meadow,
or so we are told.

In a warm-hearted effort to cement peace
with the red brethren, Brigham Young, as Superintendent 
of Indian Affairs as well as President in
Utah, set aside various parcels of lands as "Indian
Reservations", where they could hunt and fish and
also cultivate and improve farming land to provide
them a better living. One of the most prosperous
of these reservations was a twelve mile square
area established around and including the well
watered and timbered Arapeen Valley. A number
of young men from Manti, including Moroni Voorhees, 
a brother-in-law of Gen. Snow, were sent
to live with the Indians on Twelve Mile. Here
they learned the Indian language, helped build
<span id="page-255"></span>
fences and bridges and taught Arapeen's people
"white man's ways" with the land. One hundred
and ninety-five acres of land was under cultivation
at the Indian Farm there in 1858, which produced
about twelve hundred bushels of wheat besides
corn and potatoes that year.

Chief Arapeen died of smallpox on the mountains 
between Sevier and Grass Valleys, as he was
returning from a good-will trip to the Navajo country, 
and not long afterwards the Indian Black Hawk
took over as the main Chief of the Utes in his area.
It was only a few years after that the Indians were
at war with the whites again, and as we should
recall, this so-called Black Hawk War was somewhat 
triggered by the bad temper of former Chief
Arapeen's son, Jake Arapeen. After the Black
Hawk War began, in the spring of 1865, the Indians
never came back to live in Arapeen Valley, though
some came back often enough to steal and kill.
During the war the deserted Indian village and
farm on Twelve Mile became a military camp and
a number of different cavalry and scouting companies 
were stationed there off and on for three
summers, under the overall supervision of General
Daniel H. Wells. After hostilities were considered
over, the settlers once again began visiting Arapeen
Valley.

In the month of May 1870 Simon Hansen, Mads
Peter Sorenson and Carl Olsen drove their ox teams
from Gunnison to Twelve Mile canyon to cut timber
for homes and fences. They took the dirt road on
the north side of Sanpitch River going southeast
and crossed over below Chalk Hill, then followed
along the east side of the river to Twelve Mile
crossing (Christenburg) up past the "red hills"
around the lake to Arapeen Valley. Lush Spring-fed 
meadows lay to the north. The canyon stream
cut a well-willowed path through the wide creek 
bottom. As they pulled up onto the south side of
the bench above the bottoms, a magic circle of
earth and sky, bordered by a panorama of hills
and mountains, surrounded them. To the east
was Musinia (Mary's Nipple) and the Wasatch
Plateau, to the south the Glenwood mountain, to
the west, above and beyond the low hills,
<span id="page-256"></span>
Mt. Carharine and the Pahvants, and to the north
the Sanpitch mountains, visible as far as Thistle
Valley. Beneath their feet the fertile brush
covered soil was dotted with spring flowers.
White, yellow-flecked sego lilies, red Indian paintbrush, 
blue flax, pink sweet williams, lavender
sweetpeas, pastel sugarballs, and vivid blossoms
of the prickly pear and many unnamed blooms of
golden hue vied for attention. This indeed looked
like the "land of promise" to these young men in
their prime and they picked out their homestead
sites on the north side of the creek, for the land
had just been opened up for homesteading by the
national government. When they returned enthused
to Gunnison and talked about the land, others were
impressed and planned to join them. When they
mentioned their intentions to move to Bishop Horne
and asked if he had any objections, he said he had
no real ones but hated to see them go for there was
much to be done in Gunnison.

The spring of 1871 the three men and ten
others formed a co-op and began farming at Twelve
Mile. They cut the meadow hay with scythes and
divided it equally. The next year they began
digging a canal and cut a ditch to bring water from
the creek to bring irrigation water to their land on
the north and west. Bounteous crops, hand weeded,
were harvested that fall and before winter had set
in some temporary log cabins were started. But
they had trouble off and on with the Indians, who
managed to steal their horses when they were
turned out to graze unguarded on the hills. Soon
they knew enough to tie them up to their wagons at
nights. A Conference was being held in Gunnison
just before the middle of June 1872, and being eager
to attend, the men left 15-year old Niels Heiselt to
watch their horses. When they returned next day
they found Niels dead, shot by Indians as he sat by
the wagon eating his supper, and their horses gone.
This shooting occurred 14 June.

In the early spring of 1873 the three men,
Hansen, Sorenson and Olsen, brought their wives
and small children to Arapeen to live. They were
soon joined by other families. The ditch was
extended on the north division and more land was
<span id="page-257"></span>
broken up to meet the needs of the growing settlement.
On the bend of the creek the trees, shrubs
and turf were cleared of dead branches and in the
delightful nook a bowery was built. Meetings and
socials were held there and picnics and games
were enjoyed in the shade of the tall cottonwoods.
The "old swimming hole", screened by squaw
berries and birch, provided pleasure on hot summer 
days, and here the family water barrels,
mounted on two-wheeled carts in summer and
bobsleds in winter, were filled as needed from
the creek.

For the next few years, beginning on September 
14, 1874, most of the families living there
on the north side mutually agreed to live by the
rules of the United Order, to reverence Deity,
pray with families and in secret, keep the Word
of Wisdom... treat families with kindness and
affection, set an example worthy of imitation,
observe personal cleanliness, observe moral
cleanliness in speech and action, keep the
Sabbath day holy... to not appropriate for use
that which belonged to others, return all that is
borrowed... cancel indebtedness as soon as
possible, patronize the Order and combine
labor for mutual benefit.

When the U. O. Articles of Association were
recorded at the Sanpete County Courthouse in
Manti that mid-September day, it was necessary
to select a name for the new settlement. Harking
back to the beauty of the place during the month of
May they called it Mayfield. The Articles also 
insured "a twenty-five year contract for mining, 
manufacturing, commercial and other industrial
pursuits -- building wagon roads, irrigation 
ditches, colonizing and improvement of lands,
establishing and maintaining schools, churches,
libraries and any other benevolent, charitable or
scientific associations consistent with the Constitution 
of the United States and the laws of the...
Territory." Officers were to consist of a president, 
vice-president, secretary and treasurer,
appraisers and directors. Each monthly meeting
of the membership was to be conducted by a chairman 
selected from those present.
<span id="page-258"></span>

The United Order in general had been set up
as a reform movement within the Church and
inaugurated by President Brigham Young. He
preached about it at General Conference and at all
the settlements through which he traveled. The
qualification for membership was not the amount
of property possessed by the individual, but his
standing in the Church and general good conduct.
No one was admitted except those who put all they
had into the association. The question of capacity
to render valuable service to the group was not
considered; the Gospel theory and practice of "the
strong aiding the weak" was recognized and carried
out, that the whole community might rise together.
In most places the initiations of the "Order" were
accomplished by a renewal of the covenant of baptism; 
Brigham Young and his counselors setting
the example at Ephraim, Utah July 17, 1875. The
original "Law of Consecration" as introduced in
Missouri by Joseph Smith the Prophet in 1831-34,
was not strictly followed in any instance.

In Sevier Stake, of which Gunnison and Mayfield 
were than a part, the organization of the Order
came nearest to the original and proved the most
successful. First set up there right after April
conference in 1874 under the direction of Brigham
Young's oldest son, Joseph A. Young, who presided
over that Stake, it grew in popularity until eight
settlements in the Stake were involved and two-thirds 
of the membership steadily working in it.
Most kinds of work was done by contract, based
on cash prices, and the surplus credits occurring
from a man's labor, over what he drew for the
sustenance of himself and family, added to his
stock in the organization. When a member wanted
a house built and hadn't quite enough stock or credit
to pay for it, the Order built it for him and when
his credits increased he paid the balance back.
Besides the general stock, the members had
"stewardships" which were separate and which
included their homes, city lots, domestic animals,
etc., which by industry and tact they could put to
good use in procuring extras, the substantials
being furnished from the Order's source of supply.
Thus the system was considered one of the best
mutual associations in existence.

<span id="page-259"></span>
In Else K. Christensen's journal she wrote: 
-- "We were baptized into the United Order in 1875."[^3]
It must have been the very first part of 1875 however, 
that our two Christensen families from
Gunnison moved to the settlement in North Mayfield 
and joined the Order there, for in the minutes
of that Association for January 1875 we 
read -- "Resolved that we employ Elsie (Mrs. Lauritz)
Christensen and Marie C. Erickson to superintend
the milking of the cows in the company herd, and
divide the milk according to the members of each
family . . . etc." The minutes for February 1875
included the following: -- "A township, 640 acres,
is being located on the south side of Twelve Mile
Creek. . . Resolved to ask President Joseph A.
Young to counsel us in regard to moving our
improvements to this location (they did not move)
. . . Considered letters from those asking for
membership in the Order. . . It was decided to 
trade some horses for cattle. . . Resolved to
buy a Wood's Self-rake reaper". These are typical
U. O. minutes, the originals are now in possession
of a Mr. Hansen of North Mayfield, a grandson of
Peter H. Hansen, then secretary of the organization.

In her case, "baptized 25 January 1865 by Lars Hansen, received the laying on of hands the same day by Lasen Jensen in Bested, Thisted, Denmark." Then for both: "Were married 22 April 1866 in Aalborg Denmark.  Traveled to Utah the year 1866.  Received our endowment 28 October 1871.  Were baptized into the United [Forenede] Order 1875."  This is followed by a listing of their children.

Most of those early North Mayfield homes
were built of logs. The Christensens' first homes
there may have been temporary willow-covered
extensions to their wagon boxes until log cabins
could be built for them. But the families must
have been safely settled before long that mid-winter
in acceptable, though modest, quarters, since all
were to share alike in the Order, at least as far
as the essentials were concerned. They had
brought all they owned with them, which must have
been little enough, and consecrated it to the Order,
having disposed of what they could not bring. On
the other hand the spiritual gifts they brought
along must have been great, for they were people
of strong faith and deep humility in the main. 
Their spiritual blessing must have been increased
many-fold there, especially for those of them who
sincerely sought to consecrate their very lives,
as well, in an all-out effort to keep the divine laws.

In the Mayfield Order land was divided into
fifteen acre pieces, considered then to be worth
<span id="page-260"></span>
between 4 and 5 dollars per acre, with water enough
to water it being brought in ditches from Twelve
Mile Creek. Each man labored for himself after
spending so much time for the Order. He was paid
or credited in the organization for all time spent
over and above that which was required. The
amount of wages was decided by the directors,
with most men receiving full time pay and a few
not quite so much. Women were given three full
days pay for every six worked, and children were
also recompensed for their efforts. A fifteen year
old boy received a house and lot in the Order. Sloth
was considered a deadly sin. Oxen were used for
farming purposes, as Brigham Young advised, because 
they were about 50% less expensive to keep
than horses. (It was estimated at the time that it
took 200 bu. of oats per span of horses yearly and
$6.00 to keep them shod.) Oxen were also considered 
better than horses for working in the
timber. The skins on their legs were tougher,
they were less excitable in precarious situations
common to the logging business and they handled
better on long trips up and down the canyon or over
the steep rough terrain of the timber country.

Else's longing for a girl baby was satisfied
two-fold when on Monday 8 Mar. 1875 twin girls
came to bless the Christensens in their small log
cabin home in North Mayfield. The babies were
frail and Laurs called in W. N. Tofte to assist
him in giving them names and blessings right
away. Brother Tofte named the first one, Elsie
Kathrine, for her mother and she lived. Laurs
named the second Mary Karen, in memory of his
mother, but she died that same day. They always
called her "Karrie" when they spoke of her afterwards.
Laurs undoubtedly fashioned a small
casket of wood, which they lined with softest
homespun, and laying the wee corpse gently
inside, buried it in the freshly dug earth behind
their cabin. Anne was probably called to assist
with the other little girl and with Else, while
Laurs looked after the four boys as best he could.
And though they grieved for small Karrie and what
might have been, yet they must have been comforted
in the belief that she had gone to join the gentle
Karen in Paradise.
<span id="page-261"></span>

That spring some twenty-one families moved
from the northern town of Ephraim and settled on
the new townsite south of Twelve Mile Creek.
This place was at first jokingly called "New
London" for one of the English-born women in the
group but was actually South Mayfield. The
families here did not belong to the Order, but
living conditions in the two settlements were
much the same. The homes at first were mostly
small log cabins with rough lumber shanties in
the rear, later used for granaries. In addition
to caring for her family and helping with the hard
work of building new settlements from scratch,
each pioneer mother there waged a constant war
on the lizards, snakes and rodents that would
share her dwelling in spite of all she could do.
South Mayfield grew rapidly and though there was
much competition between the two settlements,
they also cooperated in building mills, roads,
ditches and other mutually helpful improvements,
as well as buying large machinery together for
the benefit of both. It is said those on the south
side called those on the north "the Orderites",
while those on the north called the south folks
"the Skinnykites". When one left to cross over the
Indian Farm and Twelve Mile Creek from one part
of Mayfield to the other he likely would be heard to
say, "I'm going over to the other side".

About the first of July that year the proud
old Dane, Christen Christensen, had endured about
all he could take of "the Order". So he pulled out
and took his family back to Gunnison. He had put
all he owned into that experiment, which had been
little enough - a few horses, cows, pigs, chickens,
a wagon and perhaps some small machinery - not
many who joined had more to give. But he took
much less than that out, the sum total of nothing
except his family's personal belongings - not even
one cow to furnish milk for his children.

Lars Myrup furnished them with an adobe 
dwelling not far from his own in East Gunnison
and most likely with sustenance as well, until
Christen could get to producing again. It was a
blow to the older man's pride to have to depend
entirely on others, even for milk for his family;
<span id="page-262"></span>
he having been so long successful and independent
and one to whom others looked for aid. A story is
told of Christen at that time by his granddaughter,
Florence C, Hougaard:-- "One morning the family
was seated at breakfast when they heard the mooing
of a cow close by. They had no cow - so they went
outside to see. Behold it was one of their own cows
they had been forced to leave behind in "the Order".
Old Bossy had followed them back to Gunnison.
They were overjoyed and Christen locked her up
in their corral right away. Speaking of it later the
old Dane said, "I don't know for sure if I did right
or not - but I felt the hand of the Lord was in it!"

Though some left the "Order" from time to
time, others moved in. If Laurs had been tempted
to pull out at the end of six months, when his father
did, something restrained him. Perhaps it was the
courageous, determined Else. Needless to say,
they stayed on there and continued to labor hard
to provide for their growing family as well as to
contribute their share and more in building the
organization. Homes were plastered on the inside
with sand and lime. Ceilings were made of cheap
factory and were whitewashed along with the walls,
either with lime or with chalk from Chalk Hill.
Men made their furniture or obtained it from the
Order, whose carpenters were always busy.
Tables, benches, chests, shelves, cradles and
beds were made from logs hauled from the mountains 
and milled at the lumber mill. Bedsprings
were made mostly from rope. Mattresses were
straw ticks or feather beds. Home spun blankets
and quilts made from worn clothing kept the family
warm, Pine and cedar from the surrounding mountains 
kept the wood-burning stoves fed. Wool from
the sheep was used for making blankets and clothing.

So life went on, and in the Order much that
went on was mapped out in the various monthly
meetings of the association, from whose minutes
we again quote: July 1875,"Met in the Bowery.
P. C. Christensen appointed to keep order in the
company yards and corrals. . . Resolved to
instruct those who attend the chickens to prepare
the eggs for shipment (by freight wagon). . .
Building committee appointed. . . Resolved to
<span id="page-263"></span>
buy notions and things that might be needed by the
women. . . Petition presented for each family to
keep a pig and chickens. Petition granted."
October 1875: "Agreed to ask some of the families
to vacate the houses belonging to the company as
they will be needed for grain bins." December 1875:
"Resolved that we declare a dividend of 10% per
annum and credit same as Capital Stock. . . New
directors elected viva voce." February 1876:
"Proposition presented to build for Peter H.
Hansen a 14 x 12 ft. house with a kitchen at back,
with both lath and plastering for walls and ceiling
in front room, on condition he is willing to give up
his present house for a meeting-house and his lot
for a jubilee lot -- proposition accepted."
December 1876: "A call has been made for donations 
for the temple to be erected at Manti.
Resolved to donate both labor and available
means. . . It was determined what credit each
stockholder should receive for his work and the
work done by his wife and children (a man received
&frac13;, &frac12;, &frac23;, or full wages, according to the work
accomplished) . . . wives who shear sheep shall
receive one day's pay for 20 head. . . &frac12; regular
pay for girls planting potatoes." January 1877:
"Resolved to put floors in the houses, one room
in each house first. . . Resolved that we subscribe
for two copies of the Deseret News semi-weekly
. . . etc. . . etc. . ." There was so much planning 
to do in the Order that monthly business
meetings sometimes lasted from early evenings
until 3 o'clock in the mornings.

Brigham Young was a great colonizer, an 
inspired leader and an outstanding personality;
in truth he was one of the world's great benefactors
and is so considered by many today. A few of the
untold number of helps instigated by him for the
benefit of his people were the Immigration Fund,
lasting peace with the redmen, railroad building,
the United Order, and University and Temple
building. The Church grew and flourished under
his leadership, as he went from city to city and
settlement to settlement meeting with and instructing 
the Saints. The last few years of his life there
<span id="page-264"></span>
were a number of things took place that particularly
affected the people of central Utah and Sanpete
County. Besides the final settlement of the Black
Hawk War in 1872 and the establishment of the
United Order 1874-75, there was the completion
of the Southern railroad to near the north border
of Sanpete, as far as York, Juab Co, 18 Feb. 1875;
the founding of the Brigham Young Academy at
Provo, Utah Co., 16 Oct. 1876; and the breaking
of ground for the temple at Manti, April 25, 1877.
Numerous Stakes and Wards all over the church
were reorganized and new ones formed in 1877
under his direction. Mayfield was made a Ward
and taken from Sevier Stake into the newly formed
Sanpete Stake, 4 July 1877, both the north and south
sides being included in the new Ward.

The last minutes of the United Order in Mayfield 
to which we have had access are the following:
January 20, 1877. "Special meeting called. . .
the President laid before the stockholders the
following: If they would be in favor of selling our
farms and remove as a company to Arizona. . .
Resolved to let the question rest until we get more
information in regard to it. . . Minutes read and
accepted, Benediction Hans N. Tuft. Adjourned
sine die. Secretary Peter H. Hansen." These
may have been the last minutes kept by that organization 
in North Mayfield, for it wasn't long before
the Order broke up there. Numbers drew out their
stock, gave up their stewardships and moved, some
to New London or South Mayfield and some elsewhere.
Still some continued to live on in "the
Order", as North Mayfield was called, although
the organization was abandoned as such, and some
of the descendants of these still live there today.
The United Order movement generally did not get
a fair start. Several factors contributed to its
early abandonment: first, membership in it was
voluntary and numbers in each area were not
willing or not considered worthy to enter the Order,
thus two classes were created in the Church, which
was undesirable; second, there was lack of uniformity 
in the movement as well as the vigorous
leadership which was withdrawn when the Prophet
Brigham Young's health began failing; third, the
great influx of non-Mormons into the territory and
<span id="page-265"></span>
the increasing complexity of community life,
which produced friction. By the time of Brigham
Young's death, 29 Aug. 1877, the majority of the
Stakes and settlements had given up the United
Order, including North Mayfield, but the Stakes
and Wards of the church continued to grow and
flourish and railroad, college and temple building
went on.

Laurs and Else Christensen and their family
were among those who went over to the other side.
By some means, Laurs procured a lot on the south
side of Mayfield, or in New London as it was then
called. The property was located some east and
south of the public square there. Whether he
homesteaded it, or purchased it from the government, 
we are unable to say. Nevertheless he
became the first recorded private owner of that
lot, for we saw an abstract of the deed. Though
it was not recorded as belonging to him until Jan.
5th 1880 (when it was all paid for or other terms
of the contract with the government had been fully
complied with) we know he moved onto the property
at least two-and-a-half years before that.

A three-room adobe house, facing west, was
soon built on the premises and before Sunday, 8
July 1877, the Christensen family had moved in.
On that particular day Else gave birth to a fine
black-haired baby girl. They selected the name
Emma Eliza for this little one but it wasn't until
4 Oct. 1877 that they took her to the church there
and had her blessed. Bishop Ole C. Olsen of
Mayfield Ward blessed and named her. On that
particular day also, the baptisms of Christen and
Andrew were taken care of by the Bishop's counselor, 
Henry Jensen, Christen had just passed
his tenth birthday (Oct. 4) and Andrew was four
months past eight. The baptisms were undoubtedly
held in the waters of Twelve Mile Creek and it is
a good guess that their mother Else was not present.

Laurs also secured a small farm in the fields
near town. His credit in the Order likely supplied
him with little more than a wagon and team of oxen,
a milch cow or two, perhaps a horse, along with a
few tools and possibly a plough; his stewardship of
cabin and lot, etc., having gone with the Order.
<span id="page-266"></span>
With the few chickens, pigs or sheep the family
may have accumulated, plus their meager furniture,
bedding and personal belongings, their total possessions 
then must have been scant indeed. The son
Albert, in his recollections which are included in
"The Hard Rich Soil" had this to say on the subject:
"After leaving the Order and settling in South Mayfield, 
the family had to do without all of what were
considered the luxuries, and at times some of the
necessities of life. With a large and growing
family it became a struggle to make ends meet."

Laurs labored on his small farm to raise
what he could. He planted, and looked at the sky
for signs of rain, for there were dry years when
water was scarce as well as wet years when the
floods came. There were years when the snows
came early, before the crops were ready to harvest,
and there were years when summer came late and
planting was delayed or when early crops were
nipped by frost. Laurs worked at other things
too - herding sheep, hauling logs and timber, railroading, 
ditch digging, road grading, freighting,
odd jobs - anything he could do to bring in a little
extra pay in produce, script or cash - but cash
was scarce. Sometimes he worked on shares.
His skin was tanned and weather-beaten as he
labored in all kinds of outdoor weather to provide
for his family. He worked for the benefit of the
Church as well, dedicating time and effort in lieu
of money, getting out timber from Twelve Mile
Canyon for the building of the Manti temple, building 
roads over which the timber could be brought,
or any other thing that his toil could supply for the
raising of that holy structure. Temple building in
Zion was a cooperative undertaking and all good
Saints were loyal to the cause. Working for the
Lord and one's self and family was a joy. It
wasn't work that wore a man down - but the worry
and fear of failing.

Else did her share. She was vigorous, capable 
and determined, for she had many dreams for
her children. She, with others of the pioneer
women there, sheared the sheep, carded the wool,
spun the thread and wove and dyed the cloth. With
her wool-cards, spinning wheel, knitting needles
<span id="page-267"></span>
and loom, she made and sewed by hand most of
the clothing worn by her family, as well as her
own. Dyes found in berries, brush, bark and dogwood 
could add a variety of color to the handmade
articles so, together with her young children, she
went into the field and hills gathering rabbit brush
for yellow and bark and berries for a variety of
browns and reds. She made rugs to cover her
floor from rags or wornout clothing, torn into
narrow strips then sewed together and woven on
a loom.

When she needed soap to help keep the family
and the home clean, she saved wood ashes in a
large barrel, poured water over them and caught
the drippings, added these to scraps of fat she had
hoarded and boiled them up together. Then after
much stirring and many skimmings over the hot
fire, she set the mixture by to cool and harden,
to be cut up into bars of soap afterwards. Water
with which to clean and wash, as well as drink and
cook, had to be carried mostly from the irrigation
ditch that ran near by. (They caught soft water in
rain barrels under the eaves.) Washing of clothes
was done by hand with homemade soap and plenty
of hard scrubbing on the washboard. The ironing
was done with stove irons, with a special fluting
iron for ruffles on skirts and bonnets. Their
clothing differed greatly from our present day
scanties; for though boys' summer clothes might
have come under that category to some extent,
female clothing in particular bore very little 
resemblance to that of the present. Long full
skirts, dragging the ground, tight long mutton
sleeved waists, warm-shawls, petite bonnets tied
under the chin, and high button shoes were high
style for women in those days - but not all could
afford to be in fashion. Clothes had to last a long
time and be durable as well as fashionable. 
Hand-me-downs and made-overs were much in style also
in early Mayfield and Gunnison days.

The boys of the Christensen family had much
worth remembering in those South Mayfield days,
for though poor in worldly goods perhaps, they
were rich in the association of "caring parents"
and each other and the developing experiences of
<span id="page-268"></span>
childhood. Again we draw from the rememberings
of Albert: -- "In our home in those years we had
family prayer mornings and evenings. Our mother
was a great person. She seemed to be able to tell
our thoughts. She always knew just what to do if
we got sick or hurt and somehow she didn't seem
like other women . . . Our father was the most
patient and kindest of fathers and never throughout
his lifetime touched a child of his in anger. A
happy childhood home and the memories of that
home are worthwhile companions for a young
boy. . . Our home was always a place of love and
peace. Contention or quarreling was uncommon.

"One of my early recollections concerns a
momentous event in the life of any boy in this
western country. Father bought us a pony. It
was an experience of ownership in common. Many
delightful hours were spent in riding this most
precious possession in the world. In the beginning,
the great thrill was riding behind one of my older
brothers, it being deemed unsafe for me to ride
alone. This limitation at least at first was accepted
without protest. To feel the exhilaration of a gallop
up the road into the mouth of Twelve Mile Canyon,
to see the willows and trees passing behind us as
we surged ahead over the lively feet of this wonderful 
horse, was a great thrill.

"The Black Hawk War was over before my
time (the year of his birth actually), but it was
very much in the minds of all of us. Tales of the
Indian depredations often were the entertainment
of both children and adults. Frequently the older
children would 'play Indian'. Sometimes I had
troubled dreams. One evening about sundown I
was out in the yard with some other boys. Some
Indian stories were being rehearsed by one of the
older boys. While I was between the house and the
boys one of them yelled, "There they come!" I
was immediately stricken with the most violent
fear and ran into the house screaming and sobbing.
Despite the reassurance of my mother as she held
me on her lap, I could not be calmed. For years
afterwards in the dark, especially in the mountains,
I frequently had to overcome the same feeling.

"One day later on I was 'riding double' behind
<span id="page-269"></span>
my brother. It was a beautiful day in early summer 
when the air was balmy and laden with the
smell of pinon pine, cedar and flowers along the
way. But the joy of riding soon vanished. Immediately 
ahead there came toward us a band of
Indians, swinging their blankets and 'whooping it
up' in regular Indian style. We turned the pony
and sped towards home. I clung to my brother in
terrible fright. Soon the Indians were upon us.
Further efforts to escape were useless. We
slowed our pace and, numb with fear, awaited
what it seemed would be an inevitable doom. To
our great surprise the Indians passed by and as
they did so one of their number said in a rather
pleasant voice, 'Hello bub, did you get scared?'
After recovering from the excitement I found that
one shoe of my only pair had been lost. Notwithstanding 
its great value, we had no immediate
desire to go back to find it. Later efforts to locate
the shoe failed. For the rest of the summer I went
barefoot, which was the custom in Mayfield among
the children generally. The lack of shoes did not
deter us from freely roaming through the fields
and along the foothills.

"When I was a little older, Indians became
more familiar. Considerable numbers camped a
short distance south of the village. Often in the
groups of Indians were boys of my own age - 6 or
7 years old. From time to time, with other boys,
I visited the camp and engaged in playing, and at
times wrestling, with Indian boys my size. The
grown-up Indians took great delight in the sport,
especially when an Indian boy would throw one of
us. At such times they would yell and applaud,
but would become silent and detached when an
Indian boy was thrown. (After Mayfield was
settled, Indians often came, spending a week or
two in town gathering food such as flour, pork and
eggs. They often brought dried venison to trade.)

"Later when I could ride alone I learned that
a boy makes a poor hitching post. My father and
some of the older boys were working on a 15-acre
farm about a mile east of Mayfield. They were
ploughing with old Tom and Jerry, a yoke of oxen.
I rode the pony up to the farm. As the sun warmed
<span id="page-270"></span>
the earth and air, I got sleepy. I decided to take
a nap on the warm land. I tied the rope that held
the pony around my waist to make sure he would
stay with me. However, my peaceful slumbers
were abruptly ended as I found myself sailing over
the ploughed ground at the end of the rope, with the
pony running hard and as frightened as I. The
chase ended without serious consequences. I do
not remember what, if anything, my father said
to me about the matter. Knowing his life-habit
of never volunteering needless advice, I am sure
he said little or nothing. He probably knew that
the experience had made sufficient impression.

"One fine day in late summer or early
autumn, the four of us brothers, Chris, Andrew,
Joseph and I, who often roamed the foothills and
fields together, were roaming the fields and accidentally 
ran across a watermelon patch. The sun
was warm and the field was dry as far as water
was concerned. The temptation was strong to
satisfy our thirst with a fine watermelon, which
we did. We were sitting there so engaged when
Jim Whitlock rode by and saw us eating the watermelon.
He evidently knew whose patch it was as
he promptly notified our mother that we were
raiding the Bishop's watermelon patch. When we
came home in the afternoon we were confronted
with the charge of stealing the Bishop's watermelons 
(Bishop Ole C. Olsen). Our mother was
a firm believer in not letting wrongs remain long
unsettled, so as might have been expected under
the circumstances, she told us we must go down
to the Bishop's place, about two blocks away, and
'make it right with him.' A vigorous demurrer
was interposed against this, but we were very
firmly told not to expect anything to eat until we
had made it right with the Bishop. None of us
was hungry, and at the time it seemed to matter
very little whether we got any dinner or not. (We
were still full of watermelon!) But we soon learned
that melon fullness does not last long. We went
about our play, but when the sun was beginning to
reach the west hills we thought about our supper.
Knowing that mother meant what she said, we
called a council of war. It was unanimously
decided to go and see the Bishop.
<span id="page-271"></span>

"We started down across the public square,
then covered with sagebrush, proceeding in Indian
style, Chris leading the way, Andrew next, then
Joseph, and I toddling along in the rear. I suppose
I felt most secure as I was the last one in order to
meet the wronged Bishop. However, we arrived
at the log home of Hannah, second wife of the
Bishop, Chris knocked rather lightly and, as we
feared he would, the Bishop answered the door.
We were invited in and he asked us what he could
do for us. The truth was hesitantly told and we
all joined in giving assurance that we didn't know
it was his patch, that we wouldn't do it again and
that we hoped he would forgive us. Breathlessly
we awaited his response. We didn't have long to
wait for he exclaimed, 'God bless you boys!' And
then he called, 'Hannah, go down to the cellar
and get these boys some melons.' Hannah did so
promptly, bringing up four large melons. The
Bishop patted us on the heads and blessed us as
though we were real heroes. We went home happy
and really grateful to the Bishop and to our mother.
We had our supper that night with a satisfied conscience, 
but as I recall we ate no more watermelon that day.

"There was another experience that we
enjoyed at serviceberry time. In the fall of the
year when these berries were ripe, the women
and children of the village went up into the hills
east of Mayfield, where the bushes were numerous
and generally loaded with fruit. This was the principal 
fruit available there at that time. Usually,
kettles and cans and all manner of other containers
would be taken along. Sheets and canvas were
spread on the ground. The branches from the
bushes would be broken off or cut down, then
shaken over the sheets and canvas. When the 
containers were filled with berries, it would be
a tired but happy group that would return to town.
Generally, the winter supply of fruit was obtained
from this source, supplemented by chokecherries,
which were also plentiful in the hills and lower
slopes of the mountains.

"In the summer of 1878 there came into my
life an experience which impressed me with the
<span id="page-272"></span>
fact that we are not wholly alone, and that there
are some things inexplicable about dreams.
Through this and other experiences I have come
to believe without doubt that warnings are sometimes 
given to people through dreams. One
morning at breakfast time mother told us that she
had had a dream about me and the big irrigation
ditch that ran past our home on the north, with a
foot-bridge across it. She told us that she dreamed
that she was standing on that bridge looking at the
water in the ditch as it flowed rapidly westward
and under the bridge. All of a sudden, upstream a
little way, she saw my hat come floating. She
hurridly stooped down from the bridge to pick it
up and when she did so, there was my face under
the hat. She said that she then awoke and was so
worried about the dream that she couldn't go back
to sleep. She was afraid that something would
happen to me if I didn't stay away from the water.
Of course, I promised that I would be careful. A
few days afterwards mother told us that she had
had another dream about the same as the first
except that she was standing on the bridge across
Twelve Mile Creek, which people crossed enroute
to North Mayfield. As she was looking at the
stream she saw my hat floating down toward the
bridge about as she had seen it a few nights before.
She rushed down to get the hat and as she picked it
up, my face was under it. That morning she
appeared more worried than ever and told us all,
and especially me, not to go near the 'creek', as
it was called. . . Very soon after the two dreams,
mother told us of another dream which she had in
which she was again on the bridge which spanned
this same creek. She again saw my hat and under
it my face, as she had seen it before in her dreams.
We all promised to be careful around the water and
not go near the creek. After a time however, as
nothing unfavorable happened, the excitement about
the dreams was more or less forgotten.

"Before this it had been common for my
brothers and me, with other boys, to go fishing on
the creek with our string lines and pin hooks. The
'Big White Hole' was especially popular. Here
the water entered the hole rapidly and the white
foam would often cover its surface in different
<span id="page-273"></span>
sized patches as clouds occasionally cover the
blue sky. . . One day, some time after the dreams,
Jim Paulson, Jim Whitlock and my oldest brother
Chris came to the place and it was there decided
to go down to the creek for a swim. Chris was
the oldest and I was the youngest of the four boys
present at the time. It was Chris' job generally
to take care of me, so I toddled along with the
other boys over the 'Indian Farmland'. We ended
up at the swimming hole. The three other boys
were good swimmers. It didn't take long for them
to slip off their clothes - whether or not they had
shoes on has escaped my memory; probably not.
For some reason the three went upstream for
seventy-five to a hundred yards to another hole.
In the meantime, I decided to paddle around in the
water but I had difficulty in getting my shirt off as
it buttoned down the back; try as I could I couldn't
get it unbuttoned. It appeared that the button was
larger than the buttonhole! I decided to go to
Chris for help. As the bank of the creek was
smoother on the north side, I determined to cross
over. The water didn't seem deep just above the
swimming hole where the water flowed rapidly.
About all I remembered was that I slipped and fell
and in an instant was in deep water. Everything
went black and then I had a faint feeling of floating
in the air. The next thing I knew I was on the sand
bank on the other side of the swimming hole with
my brother and the other two boys. They were
working my arms and legs and moving me around,
It seemed a long time before I could walk. Then
I learned what had happened. When the three had
come back to the swimming hole they couldn't see
me and they called. Receiving no answer, they
looked frantically about and finally saw my white
hair in the middle of the whirlpool. Jim had leaped
into the pool and dragged me out. As soon as I felt
better I was carried over to where our clothes
were. When we were dressed we proceeded toward
home, Chris holding one of my arms and one of the
other boys the other. As we walked along my
strength returned and by the time we got home
I was all right. We decided not to tell of this
experience as we knew it would worry especially
mother." (And Chris, Albert and Jim Whitlock
<span id="page-274"></span>
never did. However, years later, during the construction 
of the Denver and Rio Grande railroad
through Utah, when the project was proceeding
across the desert east of Price, Utah, Jim Paulson
gave the long-kept secret away. He was working
on the railroad there with Albert's father, Laurs,
and one evening around the campfire asked the
older man what ever happened to his son Albert
who was nearly drowned in Twelve Mile Creek.
When Laurs showed great surprise, the whole
story was divulged to him and later through him
to Else.)

Education in those early days in Utah was not
compulsory. Citizens in each city, town or village
handled the problem of educating their children in
their own way. Education of their children, however, 
was one of the first interests of most pioneer
parents. With Else Christensen this was particularly 
true, and she taught her own children herself
at her knee until other schooling was available 
and even afterwards. Her deep interest in the
culture and training of the mind carried over into
the lives of most of her sons and daughters. It
wasn't until the family joined the Order and moved
to North Mayfield that Christian and Andrew started
school. However, both had been so well taught by
Else in the home that when they were ready for
school they were in their "advanced readers".
Martha Hansen, wife of Simon, took the Order 
children into her home and gave them their first
school there. It wasn't until after the United
Order was abandoned that the teaching of children
was held other than in private homes in Mayfield.
Joseph must have started school first in New
London (or South Mayfield) the fall of 1877, also
in a private home, for it wasn't until 1878 that a
rock building 35 x 23 feet was erected there on the
northwest corner of the public square for school,
church and all public gatherings. Albert told of
his first educational training outside the home
thus:-- "I started District school in Mayfield in
the fall of 1878, when five years old. (He turned
six in December.) My first teacher was Gus M.
Clark and school was held in the meeting house."
<span id="page-275"></span>
As far as we can determine this all-purpose rock
building was one block west and one north from the
Christensen home in South Mayfield. This settlement 
had a school board of its own by then, which
hired and paid the teachers. The first teachers
were paid so much per pupil, often in produce or
script, since cash was scarce. Later on, three
one-room rock schools were maintained in Mayfield 
with pupils of many ages and grades meeting
together under a single teacher. One of these was
in North Mayfield and two were on the south, where
the younger grades were separated from the older
ones. Long after the Christensens had left that
settlement, the last of the nineteenth century, a
consolidation of schools took place and a new
public school building was planned to house children 
from the beginners to the eighth grade. The
spot selected for the resulting two-story brick
school house was the historic site of Chief Arapeen's 
summer home and a favorite camping
ground for his ancestors in days of long ago.

It must have taken months before word came
to Else of her father's death. Anders Christian
Christensen died in N&oslash;rhaa 10 May 1878 and was
buried in the Parish churchyard there beside his
wife Mette, 15 May 1878. Else's sister Karen
Skaarup later wrote her about it. As Else knew,
her people believed with other Lutherans that if
one died in full belief of the Trinity and had not
denied the faith they would be saved. To her the
gaining of a glorious salvation was not nearly so
easy. She herself had given so much and suffered
so much for the gospel's sake to this point, and
yet she must have felt much more would yet be
required before she could hope for the best
reward in Heaven. The status of her deceased
parents in the next world must have troubled her,
but the thought of her father's passing must have
brought heartache and memories flooding back to.
her - memories of her childhood. 

Laurs and Else and their children must have
visited back and forth with relatives in 
Gunnison - Christen and Anne, Lars Myrup and Maren,
Pauline and Andrew Andersen, and Petrine and
Sena, Petrine was now a beautiful girl nearing
<span id="page-276"></span>
twenty and keeping company with a fine young man
by the name of Jens Mikkelsen. Christen and Anne
had another son, born 10 Jan. 1877 whom they
named Joseph. Lars Myrup and Maren, keeping
pace, had a dainty little daughter born 4 June 1877,
whom they named Karen Laurine. Pauline had
gotten over her grief at losing two little sons, one
after the other in the cradle as it were, when she
gave birth to a lovely baby daughter on 13 June
1876. They had named her Annie Lenora, after
Anne (the American spelling was Annie). The news
in Gunnison that had them all talking, however, was
Lars Myrup's going into "polygamy" and taking two
more wives besides Maren.

Plural marriage was not a general law for
the entire church and was never, at any time,
practiced by over 2 percent of the eligible adult
male population. Those who were permitted to 
practice it officially were chosen for their unquestionable 
integrity and good standing, and undoubtedly
believed plural marriage to be a doctrine of divine
origin. The majority of men and women who
embraced it were among the most moral people
the world has ever known. Through this social
order the great surplus of female Saints in the
church were given protection and absorbed into
useful family life. That some of the finest people
of the church and of the world came from such
plural households is an undeniable fact. But
despite all the social reasons that may be advanced
in its favor, it must be admitted that it was directly
contrary to the tradition of the people, both in and
out of the church.

Perhaps no doctrine of the early church so
caused dissention within or without the organization
as did this so-called "polygamy". It is a fact, sad
to say, that a number within the church abused this
law. From them and ever-malicious Mormon-haters, 
rumors flew on the tongue of gossip and
were multiplied and enlarged, causing abuse,
ridicule and slander of the church and its people
to such an extent and created such a stir among
its enemies and the press, that the United States
Congress was inveigled into passing a number of
"anti-bigamy" laws, one after the other, the last
<span id="page-277"></span>
and most infamous being the "Edmunds Tucker Act."
With these laws the bitter anti-Mormons not only
intended to crush the practice of polygamy but
crush the church as well. How near they came to
succeeding can only be touched on here. For some
thirty years the bitter campaign of persecutions
raged against the church and its people. At its
height Utah, besides being denied statehood, was
actually deprived of the rights of self-government.
The property of the church was confiscated and it
was even taxed outrageously for the use of its
offices, buildings and temple block. During this
period the church was under heavy financial stress
and its credit so depleted it could not borrow a
dollar. Only the faithful payment of tithes enabled
it to weather the storm.

Members of the church for a time were not
allowed to vote or hold office. Federal officers
were sent to govern the Territory; many if not
most of them anti-Mormons who put every
stumbling block they could in the way of the
General Authorities and other church leaders who
practiced plural marriage. Most of these were
hunted down unmercifully, fined, imprisoned, or
both, or forced into exile. Some took their families 
and fled to Canada or Mexico, but most
stayed and faced the music. Hundreds of homes
were broken up, husbands and fathers sent to the
penitentiary and even wives and mothers jailed
for "contempt of court". The Prophet Brigham |
Young, who had many wives, was punished with
the rest and had his health weakened and his life
shortened due to the rigid treatment he was put
under at that time. His successor in the church,
President John Taylor, died in exile. It was not
until his successor, President Wilford Woodruff,
under divine inspiration, issued his famous
"manifesto" declaring an end to plural marriage
in this dispensation that the persecutions began
to subside. It was a number of years after that,
however, before there was peace again and church
and personal property in the Territory was restored 
to its rightful owners.

In this atmosphere our Danish progenitors
lived and breathed, for though they themselves
<span id="page-278"></span>
never embraced polygamy (one wife at a time was
enough for Christen and Laurs Christensen), yet
many of their General, Stake and Ward leaders
and their friends and associates did. For them
they were concerned. Among these of course
were Bishop Ole C. Olsen of Mayfield and their
highly esteemed kinsman, Lars Myrup. Just how
these and other of the polygamist brethren in
Gunnison handled their particular problems in
this regard, we know little. They and their
families were undoubtedly "made to pay" in some
way or another, since the wary federal authorities
were like bloodhounds - fierce on the trail and
never at rest when on the scent of an offender!
Unexpected knocks on doors of polygamist homes
during those trying times must have struck fear
to the hearts of occupants, young and old.
Searches, raids, arrests, trials and disenfranchisements 
were numerous and grievous to bear.
There was usually a hidden trapdoor to a cellar
or attic through which the head of a household
could be hustled at such times as it was breathlessly 
announced, -- "U. S, Deputy Marshals are
in town!"

Aside from their run-ins with the law, these
families often had internal problems because of
this plurality of wives. Lois Myrup Anderson, a
granddaughter of Lars and Maren, has given us a
"peek" into the Lars C. N. Myrup home during
this period:-- "Maren agreed to his second marriage 
to Josephine Marie Jensen, a very young
Danish immigrant girl. My father (Niels Christian
Myrup) remembered seeing this girl for the first
time one evening when he and the other boys were
in bed. She came into their home and threw herself 
down on the floor in front of Maren and begged
to be allowed to come and live with them. She
was not quite sixteen years old at the time and
hadn't been in this country very long. Father said
her family was very poor, Lars used to visit these
new Danish immigrant families to help them get
settled in this country, and Maren often went with
him. (They had doubtless met Danish Marie on
one of these visits.) Later Lars married this
girl (17 Jan, 1876). It was not generally known
that she and Lars were married for she worked
<span id="page-279"></span>
for Maren as a sort of a mother's helper. She
adored Maren and the feeling was mutual between
them. When Maren died suddenly, Marie also died
a few months later, people said 'of a broken heart'.
Lars married his third wife, another Danish girl
named Mary Ann Jensen, in St. George, 15 Feb.
1877. When she moved in, the kind and gentle
Maren was very much grieved when her young boys
had to give up their bedroom and sleep in the granary. 
Many times the wife Mary Ann put on men's
pants and went out to work in the fields if Lars
was short-handed. Father said that after Maren's
death your grandmother, Else Christensen, came
to their house many times to see how Maren's
children were getting along with their 'hot-
tempered' stepmother."

## THE BROWN KIT

The lack of resident doctor's services was
sorely felt at times. Fear and compassion were
mingled when epidemics of contagion spread from
home to home, and feelings of helplessness were
present when new babies were coming. The health
of their families was one of the major concerns of
most pioneer mothers. In rural areas like Gunnison
Valley, folks had to depend upon old and simple
homemade remedies and the blessings of the
Elders of the church to carry them through trials
of sickness. Senna tea was used as a laxative,
sagebrush tea or sulphur-and-molasses made a
good spring tonic. Often a few herbs administered
with faith brought about wonderful results. From
fall until spring it was the custom for most children 
to wear an asafetida bag a piece, tied on a
string around their necks, to prevent them from 
catching diseases or colds. Even midwives were
scarce and somewhat poorly trained at best. In
Mayfield, Else K. Christensen, Sena Larson,
Margaret Voorhees Whitlock and Anna Carlson
were the ladies credited as having assisted greatly
in the care of the sick during the latter 1870's.
Many hours were spent by them nursing back to
health men, women and children.

There had been sickness in the Laurs M. C.
<span id="page-280"></span>
Christensen home, the latest being the illness of
the oldest son Christian, or Chris as he was called.
Somehow he had contracted a most serious eye
infection which had progressed to the point that the
sight of the right eye at least was despaired of. In
all the region there was not a doctor or nurse to
whom they could turn for help. Else poulticed,
salved and prayed. Laurs did what he could, and
the Elders were called in to assist him in administering 
to the afflicted youngster. His grandfather
Christen was sent for and traveled back and forth
from Gunnison to advise and help, having had
excellent success in curing ailing animals from
time to time. The struggle seemed long and at
times most discouraging, but with the kind blessings 
of the Lord, together with all the special care
and treatment his loved ones could give him, young
Chris grew back to health and strength again and
his sight was preserved. The infection nevertheless 
had damaged the tear duct of his right eye,
thus allowing an occasional tear to fall on his
cheek regardless of whether he was glad or sad.
This "falling of tears" continued throughout the
lifetime of this pleasant-natured fellow. His
family called them "happy tears".

This experience brought more forcefully to
Else's mind something she had been thinking about
for quite awhile. Why couldn't she herself be
trained in the medical skills? The urge to act in
that direction had come to her from time to time
as she worked with the sick, but now the necessity
of it almost overwhelmed her. In vain she had
tried to force the thoughts of such a possibility 
from her mind. The promptings of the "still small
voice" became so strong, however, that she could
ignore them no longer. Laurs also realized the
great responsibility of trying to raise a family with
so little knowledge of diseases, etc., and no available 
doctors. He agreed that she should be given
the opportunity to seek medical training, but how?

There were so many drawbacks! Else's
family needed her. Small Emma was not yet two
and little Elsie, with a mind of her own, was
scarcely four. Laurs had his hands full making
ends meet without having the full care of two little

<span id="page-280a"></span>

<span id="page-281"></span>
girls and four active boys besides. Then there
was the problem of money -- of this they had little
and none at all to spare for the various expenses
that would have to be met if she went away to study,
even for a short period. But Else was a woman of
unusual faith. She had made difficult moves and 
decisions before in her life and she knew that if
this course was important to their future the way
would be opened for her to accomplish it. She
sought help in prayer.

Then word came of the tragedy that had
struck the Myrups in Gunnison. Again we quote
from the rememberings of Lois M. 
Anderson:-- "My father was 9 years old. He had been told to
watch his baby sister, Karen Laurine, who was
less than two years old. (Her cousin Emma's
age.) Like most little boys he got interested in
something else and forgot the little sister and she
fell into a cistern or barrel of water and was
drowned." (Niels Christian Myrup grieved about
this the rest of his life and never got over feeling
that he was responsible.) Maren was well along
with her sixth child at the time and this was hard
on her indeed. That Laurs and Else drove to
Gunnison to offer aid and comfort can well be
imagined, for this was a close-knit family. And
that Else at the time had grave misgivings at the
thoughts of leaving her own baby Emma and her
other children, can also be readily believed. Her
dreams must have been troubled as she went on
with her planning and preparation to leave her
family for awhile. She wished before leaving,
however, to see Maren safely through her delivery.

On 10 May 1879, just two months following
the sad death of her baby girl, Maren gave birth 
to her fourth son, Joseph Henry Myrup. The very
next day Else left home to take the train to Salt
Lake City, where medical training was available.
Laurs drove her in the wagon to the railroad
terminal at York, just over the Sanpete County
line into Juab. Here she took the train headed
for Salt Lake City. She had borrowed money for
her ticket and a little extra from a friend. She
had arranged also for a Sister Anderson to look
after things at home in her absence. No doubt
<span id="page-282"></span>
this lady had been duly cautioned to "keep the little
ones from the water!" The children must have
been a handful for Sister Anderson at best. In
Elsie C. Bartholomew's history she tells something
of her reaction at being left at home:-- "At the age
of four I became tired of home life, mother having
gone to Salt Lake City to study how to take care of
the sick. Sister Anderson, who was caring for the
family in mother's absence, did not please me; so
I took my belongings and went through our garden
to the next lot where the Mortensons lived. They
were grandma and grandpa to me. When I got there
I had lost one of my hand knit stockings. I retraced
my steps back to our garden and there it was, hanging 
on a gooseberry bush."

Else K. Christensen must have had a great
deal of confidence in her own capacity, or a great
deal of determination, or both. Though she had
made no prearrangements and had arrived at the
railroad station in Salt Lake City that llth of May
1879, practically a stranger, she seemed to know
exactly where she was going. Whether it was shown
her in a dream (as some have said) or had come to
her through inquiry or in some other manner, we
cannot say. Truly she was gifted with dreams and
great spiritual insight - who are we to say how she
knew her way then? Be that as it may, she went
directly to the home of an aged woman doctor of
medicine originally from Denmark, knocked on
the door, introduced herself, stated her mission
and, after only a moments hesitation, was admitted
by the elderly doctor herself, for she lived alone.
Else was without sufficient money for board and
room for any length of time at all, let alone any to
pay for medical instruction; yet here she was in
the home of this talented lady asking for these
very services.

Nicolene Olsen, Doctress and Midwife, was
suffering from an ailment of long-standing and had
discontinued her practice years before. She had
taken female students into her home from time to
time since then however, to train them in the art
of children's diseases, obstetrics and general
medicine, in which she had specialized. This she
now had also ceased to do, vowing to teach no more
<span id="page-283"></span>
and turning a number away who had sought her
assistance. But there was something about Else
K. Christensen that so impressed her that she
could not say her nay (nej). Somehow the favored
Else came to an agreement with Sister Olsen and
it is quite probable that she was allowed to work
for the aged woman in return for her lodgings and
training. On the flyleaf of a medium sized hard
backed journal the next day. Else wrote, with
scratch pen and purple ink, the following in
Danish (translated):-- "Began the 12th May on my 
instruction with Sister N. Olsen. Salt Lake
City 1879."[^4]

[^4]: This translation has been adjusted for the digital edition. "Begyndte" means 'began' not 'beginning' and "Undervisning" means 'instruction' not 'understudying.'

Else stayed at the home of Mrs. Olsen, who
spent practically all of her available time for the
next month training this eager and capable woman
in medical skills. They had no language problem,
as each was well versed in Danish, nor were there
any personality or other problems to stand in the
way of learning. Else had remarkable power to
grasp and remember the things she heard; thus
she gained rapidly a comprehensive knowledge of
obstetrics and the general practice of medicine.
Furthermore, Sister Olsen gave her a number of
her medical books and dictated various methods
and treatments, remedy recipes and directions
which Else copied neatly into her journal in Danish.[^5]
Her training also included some practical experience, 
for she delivered at least one child in the |
process. This item was written in her journal: 
-- "Br. Smith, S. L. C. en datter den 9 June 1879.
(From then on for the next fourteen years she
recorded the father's name, and sex and date of
birth of hundreds of other babies she ushered into
the world.)

[^5]: These instructions, comprising pp. 1-23 of Else's notebook, are clearly in a different hand from Else's, whose log of babies delivered and other entries, in her own distinctive hand, begin p. 25.  It is probable that Nicolene Olsen herself wrote the detailed instructions as she was teaching Else. This part was later separately translated by Virginia's nephew Bryce Christensen, who had earlier also translated the Danish letters for her book.  (Bryce served as a young man in Denmark.) A scan of Else's large notebook, Bryce's translation of the training, and a photo of her medical bag can be found under Memories on Else K.'s FamilySearch page.

When the generous Danish lady had taught
her student all she herself had learned in her
medical studies in Copenhagen, besides much she
had acquired throughout years of practice, the
period of intensive training was ended and Else
was ready to return home to her husband and
children, as well as to begin her new career.
But first she purchased some tools-of-the-trade
as it were, which included, among other smaller
items, a blood-letting knife. Likely some whiskey
<span id="page-284"></span>
(she wrote it "Hvisky") was also included since
this was called for in various of the treatments
she had studied. She also purchased a middle-sized 
brown satchel or kit, in which to carry her
professional equipment.[^6] Upon her leaving, the
gracious teacher bid her a tearful farewell, for
they had grown to be staunch friends, and gave her
the following letter of recommendation (translated
from the Danish):-- "Salt Lake City, June 14, 
1879 - It is Sister Christensen's wish to live to be an
excellent midwife and to bring help and happiness
to suffering humanity so that she may be an honor
to God and a blessing to his people. I myself felt
that I didn't want to give any more instruction in
this work, because of my weakness and long lasting
ailment I have had to fight. But when Sister
Christensen stepped to my door there was an
unexplainable spirit that attended her and it was
impossible for me to refuse her. As I became
acquainted with her I realized that she was a most
worthy person, and she has proved in every way to
be superior to anyone I have ever trained in my
home in this work - this dear, unforgettable
daughter of God. And because of this, with
willingness and in all sincerity, I give her the
very best recommendation to anyone who under
any condition may need the sincere help of Sister
Christensen. She will attend them and care for
and protect them as a mother of Israel, with love
and wisdom and with sympathy and patience. This
is my full conviction. Wherefore I am satisfied to
leave her in the hands of God, and anyone who
needs her help, with my very best recommendation.
And may the Lord of Israel bless her entrance into
and exit from every home is my prayer, in Jesus'
name - Amen. Nicolene Olsen, Midwife and
Doctress."

[^6]: This brown kit or medical bag and the blood-letting knife (depicted on p. 280a) passed from Else K. to her son Albert.  In the bag were stored Else's notebooks, letters from family members in Denmark, and other documents.  As the Preface indicates, these very nearly got thrown out some time after Albert's death but fortunately were given to Albert's daughter Virginia.  From Virginia, the bag and the notebooks went to her daughter Colleen Jones, then to Virginia's nephew Bryce Christensen.  Bryce gave these on to George Tate in 2017 to donate to the Church History Library (the notebooks) and the Church History Museum (the medical bag). These are now in the Lauritz Mathias Christian Christensen (1847-1926) and Else Kathrine Andersen Christensen (1847-1923) collection at those institutions.  The blood-letting instrument passed to Albert's son A. Sherman, then to Sherman's son A. Kent, a professor of medicine who died in 2017.  It is still in Kent's family.

* * * * *

When Else returned to Mayfield she was at
once called into service. The nearest regular
doctors were at Manti and Ephraim and so her
help was greatly needed, not only in her own town
but in all of South Sanpete. She had only been home
a day or two when she was called to deliver a new
baby, recorded thus in her medical
<span id="page-285"></span>
journal:--"Lars Greekkersen (prob. Gregersen) en datter
den 17 June 1879." It wasn't long before her
ability became known in the towns neighboring on
Mayfield, from Salina on the south to Pettyville
(Sterling) on the north. Else made her work one
of mercy and love. With her brown kit in one hand
and a bowl of Danish soup in the other, she went
forth serving the sick and the needy. Members of
her family soon became accustomed to the sound
of heavy wagons rattling up the street and stopping
at their place any time of night or day. Then Else
would be off on her missions of mercy, for she
was usually prepared to leave at almost a moment's
notice.

Whether she assisted at the birth of Christen
and Anne's last child and fifth son, George Ludvig
Christensen, 20 Aug. 1879, was not recorded in
her journal. (This child only lived one-and-a-half
years, passing away 11 Feb. 1881). But surely
Else must have been summoned to the same home
and the bedside of Christen and Karen's twenty
year old daughter Petrine, some two weeks later.
We have no details of the cause of Petrine's death,
only that she succumbed 8 Sept. 1879 in Gunnison.
This lovely girl was engaged to be married at the
time to Jens Mikkelsen (later of Manti). Her loss
must have been a cause of much sorrow to her
loved ones and friends. Death is sad at any time
but when one is in the full bloom of youth with so
many plans and hopes for the future, it can seem
sadder. (She was not soon forgotten by Jens
Mikkelsen, for 26 Mar. 1903 he and his wife then
went to the Manti temple where he was sealed to
Petrine Christensen for eternity, and his wife
stood for her.) Caskets of wood for the deceased
were made locally then by one James Hansen of
Centerfield. In those days they were covered
with a black material and it was not until about
1886 that white covered coffins were first used
in the area.

But there were happy times too, especially
for the children. Christmastime was always celebrated 
with much gaiety in the Christensen household, 
with the traditional Danish ways of holding
Yule mingled with pioneer customs. Christmas
<span id="page-286"></span>
Eve was the important family gathering time when
one and all mingled their voices in laughter and
song and, holding hands, danced around the candle
lighted Christmas tree. Then the "Yule Nisser",
"Christmas Elves", "Santa's Brownies", or whatever 
they chanced to call them then, would be
expected and the children would be rushed off to
bed after hanging up their stockings and putting
out a dish of rice mush or pudding on the doorstep
to feed the night visitors. (This Christmas Eve
family evening became so firmly established in the
L.M.C. Christensen home that it has endured
among some of his descendants for three generations.) 
Presents for the children's Christmas would
be mostly homemade things: perhaps marbles made
from clay, berry stained red-cheeked rag dolls,
dolls carved from wood with hair of black sheep's
wool or modest corncob dolls; molasses or honey
candy and pinenuts and pine and spruce gum
gathered from the mountains. If a feast could not
be spread at any other time of the year, Else would
at least manage one for Christmas Day - stuffed
goose, pork or sausage, sweet soup made with sego,
dried currants, prunes and cinnamon-stick, coffee
cake and a kettle of fragrant Danish soup steaming
around plump islands of Danish dumplings for
accompaniment. The last day of each year was the
traditional time for a community party for the
children there. On New Year's Eve in Mayfield,
that year of 1879, "the meeting house, bedecked
with evergreen banners and rosettes, was turned
into a fairy bower, Santa Claus, standing between
two giant Christmas trees illuminated with scores
of candles, gave a welcome to all. Each of the 120
children present drew prizes from the trees." It is
quite certain that at least the five older children of
Laurs and Else Christensen were among those
there to draw prizes as well as to enjoy the excitement 
of the festivities.

In spite of the unprecedented cold weather in
the spring and early summer of 1879, when sugar
cane froze three times in June and the maize twice
in July, the crops had been about normal. The
acorn crop in the mountains, however, had been
particularly abundant, which, according to Indian
legend, foretold a hard winter ahead. Two
<span id="page-287"></span>
venturesome gentlemen decided to profit by this
acorn crop and thus turned a large number of
hungry hogs loose in Twelve Mile Canyon to feed
on them. But the two "gentlemen" quarreled and
the project was apparently abandoned. By the late
fall the pigs refused to live on the acorns any
longer and came out of the mountains and down
into the fields around Mayfield by the hundreds.
Some of them were penned by the people, as no
one seemed to own them. Laurs and his boys captured 
a couple of the roaming hogs, as others were
doing, and penned them up in their back yard. It
seems none were prepared for the exceptionally
severe winter that followed. Snow fell to an
abnormal depth early in the season, piled up high
during the winter, and kept up so late in the spring
of 1880 that animals of all kinds could not find anything 
to eat in the fields or on the range.

In his recollections Albert tells of the tragedy
that was suffered by the Laurs Christensen family
at that time:-- "Soon all of the feed at home was
gone and our animals were kept alive only by eating
the straw from the straw sheds. Father had a yoke
of oxen, "Tom" and "Jim", one old milch cow,
"Bluebell" and a heifer "Lillie", that would calve
in the spring or summer. These were the hope
and pride of the family. With careful feeding,
father managed to winter his oxen, cow and heifer.
The hogs were butchered. As soon as vegetation
commenced to grow in the spring, he turned our
oxen and the young heifer out to forage on the foothills 
east of Mayfield with the hope that they could
get food sufficient to survive. We kept track of
them and at first they seemed to be doing well.

"One day, however, my brother Joseph and
I were hiking about in those east hills barefoot. 
We first found Lillie in a hollow, dead. She was
swelled up with her legs sticking up in the air.
Then we went in search of Tom and Jim. We
found Tom all right up on a side hill south of
where we had located Lillie's body. We found
Jim further up on the hill; his back was downhill,
his legs were in the air - he was dead. Doubtless
the two had eaten poison weeds. Now we just had
the old cow Bluebell, who was dry, and the ox Tom.
<span id="page-288"></span>
This was indeed bad news for the family." These
crushing losses during such hard times made a
vivid impression on seven-and-a-half year old
Albert at the time.

For Laurs himself this catastrophe, coupled
with the hardships and emotional strain of the past
few years plus the economic uncertainty and anxiety
of the present, seemed like a last straw. He became 
despondent and discouraged and his health
and courage began to break. In this unhappy condition 
he seemed, at least momentarily, to have
blamed the Bishop and even the Church itself for
this misfortune; having, in a quandary to know what
to do with his starving animals that desperate spring,
asked the advice of the Bishop and taken it. Echoing
far off down the musty corridors of time we hear
the words of a somewhat tense domestic drama,
similar to one which reportedly took place in Mayfield 
that spring of 1880... The despairing voice
of Laurs:-- "Let's give it all up and go back to
Denmark where we belong! I'm sick and tired of
the never-ending struggle of it all. Ever since we
left the Old Country we have had little else but
grief, worry, toil and failure!". . . Then the
answering voice of the oft outspoken Else, weary
with the burden of her tenth child, yet 
unborn:-- "I gave up my family, home, friends, all that I
then held dear for the sake of the Gospel. I risked
my life with you on the angry sea; I walked by your
side over vast plains and rugged mountains, in the
scorch of sun - the beat of wind and rain - the
chill of snow; I held my ears to shut out the shrieks
of murdering Indians and pounding of drums, as I
bore your first sons; I have feared for my life and
at times gone hungry; I have slaved and toiled with
you, and born your many children - I have buried
one of our own flesh and blood. Now if you think I
am going to 'give it all up', as you suggest, and
take our sons and daughters far away from the
influence and strength and blessings of Zion to
raise, because of an old dead cow, you are not
the man I thought you to be! You may go - but
you will go alone" . . and that ended it.

Discouragement can weaken body and mind
and cause even the spirit to falter at times. Laurs
<span id="page-289"></span>
too was a thoroughbred in every sense of the word.
He also had given up much for the Gospel and
almost everything for his wife and children. He
had not only done his own work, trying to build
and provide for his family, but had of course
taken a great deal of the responsibility of the
home while Else had been in training, and continued 
to do so while she was acting as nurse
and doctor. While he could not do the heavy 
house-work, he did more than his share in caring for the
children. He had provided them with a fairly comfortable 
three-roomed adobe house there in South
Mayfield, with a log granary, cow sheds, pigpen,
chicken coup, outhouse and other needed additions
in back. (These were well built for most of them
are still standing.) He was faithful to the Church
and his Priesthood, honest in his dealings with
man and God, a kind, helpful and devoted husband
and a wonderfully patient, understanding and loving
father. Hard-working as his strength would allow,
he was also dependable as the coming of night after
day. He seldom complained and cast off most of
his troubles with a shrug of his shoulders and a
witty remark.

Can one think of Grandma Else without
Grandpa Laurs? Nej, nej, for they belonged
together. The thorns and thistles in our paths of
life may retard our progress briefly. It is no disgrace 
to stumble o'er them. The important thing
is that we rise again and go forward, even though
bruised and torn, fighting our way along. It is 
not what one has to contend with along the way of
life but what one is able to endure and overcome
that signals success.

Laurs squared his shoulders again, yoked
Tom up with the neighbor's ox, put his hand to the
plough and went forward with his farm work. Then
Else gave birth to their tenth child, Lars Peter
Christensen (later changed to Louis D.) Saturday
20 Mar. 1880, there in their home in Mayfield.
According to the record in her journal she took
care of the delivery herself, though she likely
leaned heavily on her husband for help at the time.
This, their fifth son, must have been a good sized
baby for he grew to be the largest of their children,
<span id="page-290"></span>
They had this infant named and blessed at the
church 3rd June by Bishop Ole C. Olsen. He was
a fair child with curly blonde hair, a mischievous
smile and a powerful pair of lungs. It soon became
apparent that he would make his voice heard in the
world.

Else's work with the sick now took her to all
parts of Gunnison Valley. If it was as a midwife
she went her fee not only included delivering the
baby but taking care of it and the mother as well,
during her confinement or "lying in" period, which
lasted on the average of two weeks. She also did
some of the housework and the washing for her
patients. She was often paid in other than money;
for example:-- (From her journal) "Mrs. King
came and paid. . . peaches .60, butter .60,
wheat $1.60, hat .25 = $3.05 - owe $11.80;
Frandsen came the 6 Jan. . . wood $2.00, 2 dolly
$2.00 - paid $15, . etc." But whether she was
paid in cash or produce her earnings must have
helped a great deal to give a lift to the sagging
economy of the hard-pressed family, proving to
be a blessing.

An increasing number of Else's patients
were now coming from the town of Gunnison, which
was more central and held by far the larger part of
the valley's population. It was decided that it would
be much more convenient for the family if they
would pick up and leave Mayfield and move back to
Gunnison. Else could look in on her loved ones
more often while working there and educational
opportunities for the children would be better also.
So Laurs found a buyer for his home and small
farm, one Lars P. Jensen from Pleasant Grove,
Utah County. As a down payment Brother Jensen
gave Laurs a wagon and team of horses, we are
not aware of what else. It appears that the deal
was made sometime around the fore part of July
1880, but the property was not completely paid for
until 10 Apr. 1906, at which date it was deeded by
Laurs to the other party.

Their brother-in-law, Lars Myrup, made
one of his two homes in Gunnison available to them
and their brood of seven that early summer. As
far as we can ascertain this small adobe house was
<span id="page-291"></span>
in the eastern part of town about a half mile west
of where Christen, Anne and their family were
settled. It appears that Myrup's other Gunnison
home was in the southern part of town just east
of the main street which led south to "the Field"
or South Gunnison; for here, it has been said, he
owned about a city block of land. He also owned
an extensive farm near the sugar factory in those
south fields and was building a new home in that
area. Though a number of families were already
living on their farms there, in the early 1880s
settlers moved out into South Gunnison in great
numbers, including the families of Laurs Myrup
and Andrew and Pauline Andersen. Many new
homes were built, some of adobe, some of logs.

Soon after moving back to Gunnison, Laurs
Christensen leased a farm in Christenburg, about
three or four miles from where they then lived,
from a large landowner and stockraiser by the
name of Julius H. Christensen (no relation). Mr.
Christensen and his two brothers, Theodore and
Titus, owned a great deal of the land in that desirable 
location midway between Gunnison and Mayfield.
In fact, they had been the first to take up
land and move their families there, and it was
after them that this sprawling, scattered farming
area of Christenburg had been named. The early
spring of the next year (1881) Laurs and Else and
their children moved from the Myrup home in East
Gunnison to a rented house in North Christenburg,
known as Antelope Valley, to be nearer their
leased farm. The earliest homes there were
three-room ranch type dwellings with walls of
adobe. "Wild flowers and grass, seeded by the
wind and watered by the rain, covered the thick
sod on each roof in their time and season." Here
to this choice farming land lying east and north
of Chalk Hill and bordering the Sanpitch River,
Laurs brought his family to live for the next three
or four summers.

In the meantime he purchased an acre of 
ground in the northwest part of Gunnison on which
stood a small adobe house with two rooms, facing
south and standing back a considerable distance
from the street. In this his family lived during
<span id="page-292"></span>
the winters. Soon a larger house was erected
just south and west of the old one and both places
were used to house the large Christensen family
in winters for a year or so until the new house
could be completed. This house was built mostly
ofrock hauled from the quarry north of Gunnison
cemetery. Eventually the new house boasted three
good sized rooms besides a kitchen and pantry on
the ground floor plus one large unfinished and two
small finished rooms in the attic upstairs, used
for sleeping. Whether the new rock house was
sufficiently completed in time to welcome Laurs'
and Else's second pair of twins is not known, but
that they were born in one or the other of those
two houses on the corner of first north and second
west in Gunnison is a certainty.

These second twins, a boy anda girl, were
born at 4 o'clock in the morning, Wed. 19 July
1882, and according to Else's journal she had no
attending midwife other than herself. The little
ones were feeble however, and help was sent for
to give them names and blessings. Grandfather
Christen Christensen came and blessed the first
child, a boy, giving him the name Arthur Marinus
Christensen. Brother John Wasden, a neighbor
from across the street, gave the little girl a blessing 
and the name Martine Lauriette, the second
name for Laurs, but she died about 12 noon that
same day. And so another little spirit went to join
her sister and others of her departed kin in Paradise. 
The boy Arthur lived and, under the tender
and expert care of his fond mother, grew in health
and strength and wisdom. It was not until Feb. l,
1883, however, that they took him to church for
his official christening.

It is a great thing to deliver one's own twin
babies; but when we consider that Else delivered
at least twenty-six babies in 1882, one of them a
daughter for Hans Jensen just six days before her
twins came, another a daughter for Lars Myrup
nineteen days after, the picture becomes far more
involved, and we are led to feel nothing but amazement 
at the accomplishments of this remarkable
woman. We are not forgetting for a moment either
that when possible she did much of the housework
<span id="page-293"></span>
and took care of the mothers and babies she
brought, until the mothers were up and around
again. Of course she had the help of her family,
as well as a hired girl in the home much of the
time, but nevertheless she was simply marvelous
during those crowded years of her medical service.
Her brown kit was always ready, standing by the
side of her bedroom door, and there were many
sick that she attended, aside from her duties as
midwife, for folks came to her from all over the
valley and she answered their calls willingly and
promptly. It will always be a mystery how Else
K. continued her work of love and mercy for others
without neglecting her own family, but the health
and education of her children was one of her chief
concerns and was always taken care of in the best
possible manner. She was also concerned with the
health of her husband and tried to keep him in top
physical condition. We have been told that one of
the methods she used on Laurs for this purpose
was to thin his blood every spring with her blood-letting 
knife. As a spring tonic for her children,
however, she used the less severe treatment of
sulphur and molasses or a big dose of epsom salts.

* * * * *

When Maren Myrup's seventh child was born,
10 May 1881, Else was at the delivery bed of her
beloved sister-in-law. Little Sarahann Myrup,
however, only lived about sixteen months and then
passed away (Sept. 1882). It was about this time
that an incident happened involving Maren and her
second son Niels, and told as follows by Lois M.
Anderson:-- "My father told me one story that I
shall always remember. When he was about ten
years old he was sent to help his grandfather, 
Christen Christensen, doing odd jobs around the
yard. One morning when he arrived his grandpa
accused him of taking some of his tools. Father
denied this but his grandpa apparently didn't believe
him and gave him a good 'cuffing' to force him to
tell the truth. When young Niels got away he ran
home and told his mother, the lovely, ladylike
little Maren, who promptly ordered the boys to 
hitch up the buggy and taking her son Niels alongside 
on the seat, and with the buggy whip in her
<span id="page-294"></span>
hand, set out to confront her father. Niels said
later that sitting there looking at his irate little
mother with the whip in her hand, he began to fear
for his grandfather. Maren was convinced that her
son was telling the truth. When they arrived at her
father's place, Christen apologized to them both.
I cannot remember whether the tools were found
or not but I don't suppose Maren sent her young
son to work for his grandfather again, at least not
that year. I think our great-grandfather Christensen 
was a rather stern man, at any rate for our
day."

Nearly nine months following the death of
Maren's little Sarahann, Else was called in to
deliver another baby for her. Manda May Myrup,
born in Gunnison 24 May 1883, was Maren's eighth
and last child, for this young thirty-four-and-a-half
year old mother was not permitted to watch
over the lives of her children in mortality much
longer. When tiny Manda lacked eleven days of
being two months old, Maren died very suddenly
(13 July 1883) of what was later believed to be
appendicitis, although it was not known by that
name then. Lars Myrup's second wife, Marie,
took little Manda to care for but the small child
only outlived her mother less than a month, dying
in August that same year. Thus the plucky little
Danish emigrant pioneer and mother, Maren, came
to her life's end and her body rested at length beside 
those of her three infant daughters in the
Gunnison cemetery. Her oldest daughter Mary and
four sons, Lars or Lewis C., Niels C., Adolph M.,
and Joseph Henry survived her and lived to marry
and bring a sizable posterity into the world to honor
the memory of Maren Christensen Myrup.

Else K. felt concern for her sister-in-law's
children and after their mother's death looked in
on them often to see how they were getting along
with their "hot-tempered stepmother". Maren's
boys were still sleeping in the granary at the
Myrup place when they all took measles and had
them very bad. Else went out time and again to
help doctor them. They all thought a great deal
of their Aunt Else. A little later on the son Niels
developed the nervous disorder, St. Vitus' Dance,
<span id="page-295"></span>
and Else again traveled back and forth to Centerfield 
to doctor him. She gave him some nerve
medicine which helped him sleep at nights. The
treatments must have been effective for the malady
didn't stay long with him.

Those summers in the early 1880s when the
Laurs Christensen family moved out into Antelope
Valley (North Christenburg) must have been looked
forward to especially by the children. Though the
older ones helped their father on the farm there or
herded sheep or cattle, there was always time to
roam barefoot through the meadows, play 
hide-and-go-seek, pomp-pomp-pull-away or such with
the children of Ole and Inger Larsen, who lived
neighbors, or go swimming with them in the "Big
Hole", a bend in the Sanpitch River back of the
Larsens' barn. It was while swimming here in
the Big Hole that little Elizabeth Larsen, about
four years old, had been drowned. They found
her small body one mile down stream.

Else K. was of course still going out from
here on her missions of mercy. One of the older
Larsen children, Caroline, remembered that one
evening when Sister Christensen had just returned
from one of her longer periods of doctoring, her
son Albert ran out to greet her with these words,
"Mother we are having clabber milk and lettuce
for supper!" Perhaps Caroline thought this a very
strange meal, but no doubt young Albert knew how
much his mother enjoyed clabber-milk. In her
memoirs Caroline Larsen recalled other things
about the Christensens. She remembered Albert
as being a very spiritual child; for sometimes,
when the children were all playing there together,
Albert would come up missing. When they hunted
they would often find him in some thick bushes or
trees - praying. So then they would all tiptoe
away very quietly and wait, never saying a word
to him about it afterwards. Though Caroline was
nearer Joseph's and Albert's age she was drawn
to their eldest brother Christian. Later there in
Christenburg she and Christian became childhood
sweethearts.

Not far north from the Christensen and Larsen
homes there was a sheep-shearing corral, which
<span id="page-296"></span>
had been maintained from the early years of
Christenburg's settlement. As many as 40,000
head of sheep on their way from the desert to the
summer range were sheared there annually by
experts, some of them from Antelope Valley. We
have been told that Else K. Christensen sheared
many sheep at this corral in those early days and
that she could outshear many of the men. When
the sheep came in for shearing in the early spring,
small hills of wool-filled sacks would pile up at
the corral. It was great sport for the children who
lived nearby, and others who came in with owners
of the herds, to clamber up and jump down or chase
each other back and forth over and around these
huge piles of filled wool-sacks. Sometimes whole
families would come in during sheep shearing time
and make a days picnic of it. This shearing corral
was kept up well into the twentieth century. The
Larsen and Christensen children enjoyed this fun
year after year in those early Christenburg days,
as some of their children and even their grandchildren 
did after them.

At one time in Christenburg a heart-rending
experience happened in the Christensen household.
One cool evening, perhaps in early spring or late
fall, a hot log fire was ablaze in the fireplace of
their dwelling, to warm things. Young Louis,
about four years old, had been snuggled into one
of his father's old coats and was standing near the
open fire to make doubly sure of getting warmed up.
The coat almost dragged the floor and its sleeves
hung well down over his chubby hands. In an
unguarded moment the small boy reached out his
arms towards the dancing flames and at that instant
the right sleeve of the coat caught fire and before
the pain-stricken, screaming child could be given
the necessary help by his distracted parents, the
four fingers of his right hand were so terribly
burned, down to the very knuckles, that they could
not be saved. All of his mother's medical powers
and the spiritual strength of the entire family was
brought to bear in an effort to heal the seared flesh
of suffering little "Lou". Proud flesh set in and it
was with much difficulty that Else was able to save
the hand proper. She often told of how she worked,
wept, and prayed to save that hand! Nobs grew on
<span id="page-297"></span>
the stumps but the fingers never grew in again,
but with the help of the Lord the main part of the
hand was preserved and became useful again; for
Louis learned to use this maimed hand with great
dexterity in the years that followed.

It was there in Christenburg, 10 July 1884,
that a church Patriarch by the name of K. H.
Brown, along with his Danish scribe Antone C.
Sorensen, came to the Christensen home by appointment 
to give blessings of counsel and encouragement 
to various members of the family. Laurs
and Else had blessings at that time, as well as
Albert, Elsie and even little Louis, and perhaps
most of the other family members who were at
home at the time. Since the mother Else's blessing 
had so much influence on her later life, as
perhaps was true of the others also, we wish to
quote parts of it here:-- ". . . If you will listen to
your husband's advice and to the voice of the 'still
small spirit' the Lord shall give you holy visions
by day and holy dreams at night, clothe you with
power from on high so that you shall have wisdom
to manage your house, be a comfort and support
to your husband, and a good mother to your 
children. . . You shall be known of the Lord and your
seed shall be blessed by him. . . You shall have
wisdom to do much good among your brothers and
sisters in Zion and the Lord shall bless you with
faith. . . the works of your hands shall be blessed.
Your pantry shall always be full and your children
never lack for the good things of life. . . Your
posterity shall be blessed and shall be a star in
your crown and a comfort in your old age. . .
You were chosen to come forth here on the earth
in order to accomplish a great mission, along
with your husband and family, for your father's
and mother's lineage, those who are now dead and
in prison waiting to be freed by you and your
family. . . Because of your obedience to the
Gospel and your faithfulness throughout trials you
shall live to see, while still in the flesh, your
children and grandchildren receive possessions
in the Stakes of Zion and the Spirit of the Lord
rest upon them." It was through this blessing
that summer's day in Christenburg, that the
"Spirit of Elijah" or the seed of genealogy was,
<span id="page-298"></span>
if not planted, at least caused to sprout and grow
in the mind and heart of Else K. Christensen. Her
beloved parents and her ancient kinsmen in an
eternal prison - could it be? Was it her destiny
to free them? Such thoughts may have been
mingled with her thinking as she was seized with
a feeling of the necessity of her searching out the
records of her dead ancestors, and from that day
she began to plan for it.

There were no stores or businesses in
Christenburg, or any "meeting house" - just
stretches of farms, orchards and meadows, with
a few farm dwellings and barns, etc., with the
Sanpitch River winding its way between. The
Christensens, Larsens, and the few other families
there, were obliged to travel to Gunnison to attend
religious services. When their elders went along
they usually rode, but otherwise the children
walked back and forth to Sunday schools, Primaries,
and Religion classes, each wearing his or her only
good pair of shoes, thus called Sunday shoes. It
was here in Christenburg that the older Christensen
children learned early in life the value of work,
thrift and industry. Here they learned to appreciate
nature and developed a love for the out-of-doors
and the "good earth". It was here also that the
older boys became acquainted with the man from
whom their father leased his farm, the well-to-do
land owner and sheepman Julius H. Christensen,
and he acquainted with them to the satisfactory
point, at least, that this gentleman came to think
enough of them to hire them to work for him, one
after the other for many years, beginning with the
oldest, Chris.

Laurs Christensen and Ole H. Larsen often
freighted together during this period, and later on
as well. Though the danger from outlaws and
robbers was not then as great as in earlier times
it was still a threat and thus considered safest for
freighters to travel in groups, and so they did.
There was safety in numbers in case of sickness
or injuries, runaways or broken wagons, as well
as highwaymen. It was extremely dangerous to
carry money. Pay for freighted produce was as
a rule sent home by mail. Grain, flour, meat and
<span id="page-299"></span>
poultry, fruit and garden products were hauled to
the mines in Utah and Nevada; anything that would
sell, in fact, was taken there to sell, often for
gold. Many farmers made trips after their crops
had been harvested or at other times when the
farm work could be managed by the women and
children. Taking care of their animals, preparing
food and entertaining each with tales of Indians and
the olden days around the campfire, relieved the
monotony of these long hard trips.

* * * * *

Laurs and Else's eleventh and last child was
born in the new rock house in northwest Gunnison
at nine o'clock on a Sunday night, 27 March 1887.
She was blessed in the home 7 April and given the
name Elevena, after the Danish way of naming;
viz - if the eleventh child happened to be a girl
she was given the name Elevena; if the eighth child
happened to be a boy, he was named Otto, etc.
Later the spelling was simplified to Elvena but
almost from the first she was called "Vena" by
everyone except her mother. Though not mentioned 
in Else's journal, this home naming was
probably done by Elvena's grandfather, Christen
Christensen, since he was usually called for such
a service if available. The child's official blessing 
and naming at church, however, was not taken
care of for nearly two years and nine months
following her birth, or 23 Dec. 1889, and it was
done then by Gunnison's Bishop Christian August
Madsen.

On Christen Christensen's seventieth birthday, 
29 July that year of 1887, all of his living
descendants got together and held a celebration
in his honor at his home in east Gunnison. He
turned handsprings to show all present what he
could do at his age; none others there could do
what he did. He had a lively disposition and was
a good mixer. He loved to dance and did very well
at it. But most of all he was a fine storyteller,
and folks always gathered round to hear the tales
he told, especially the young people. He was an
excellent letter writer and a fine penman besides.
He always wrote to his folks in Denmark once a
year, and on these occasions he related to them
<span id="page-300"></span>
everything of interest that had transpired during
the past year. He had an excellent memory. He
had his wife Anne take notes for him as the year
progressed, and when he was ready to make his
yearly report he would take these notes and go
into a room by himself and write his letter. This
would take him many days - but when the letter was
finished it was worth it. Anne would read it through
aloud and the children always tried to be around to
enjoy the contents before it was mailed off to
Denmark.

Christen Christensen at seventy was still a
very proud man, although the vicissitudes of life
had mellowed him some. He had lost most of what
he had when he left the United Order, and though a
farmer and stockraiser by trade, and a very good
one, he had taken up the job of delivering salt to
the people of the county to get a little ready cash
to help re-establish himself. He got the salt from
the salt bluffs about two miles west of Axtell. This
placer salt-bearing mine embraced about 40 acres
in that locality. In the earliest days of settlement
each family had obtained and refined its own salt,
but later it became quite an object of barter and
many necessities were obtained through this traffic.
The price of rock salt in 1884 was $2.00 per ton,
delivered, but naturally it became more expensive
as people prospered. The many tons of rock salt
hauled to the silver mines in Utah, Idaho and
Nevada were of some consideration to the economy
of the people who dug it out and hauled it. Christen
hauled rock salt at first and he became quite a 
well-known figure throughout Gunnison Valley, seated
erect in his little "salt-cart" driving through,
stopping at farmhouses and dwellings along his
route to deliver his commodity. Later several
boileries were established in the valley, with
capacities to turn out 400 tons of fine salt yearly.
Lars Myrup had one of these out in Centerfield
where he made and sold table salt. He had several
working for him. They would take a wagon and
drive out to Redmond (west of Axtell) and get the
rock salt, return with it to Centerfield and put it
in a large vat or boiler, filled with boiling water,
where it would be dissolved. When the salt had
all crystalized in the bottom and the dross had
<span id="page-301"></span>
been drained off, the salt crystals were dried out,
ground and sold. It was quite possible that
Christen worked for his son-in-law, Lars Myrup,
selling the refined salt; for he kept up both farming 
and delivering salt as long as he was able. Be
that as it may, one's eyes grow moist thinking of
this once proud Danish gentleman whom some had
called "the great man of the north", who once
drove his own fine team and carriage as a 
well-to-do farmer in Old Denmark, peddling salt in
Zion in an old one-horse cart.

A nice thing happened to this fine old man
about this time. The three Hansen orphans, whom
he had long sought to find, found him! In some
way they had learned that Christen was the one
who had paid their passage, and that of their dead
parents, to Zion more than twenty years before.
They located his whereabouts and came to pay him
back for this noble service. They were some of
the very few who ever reimbursed him for the
financial help he had given them in getting to
America. He never worried about this and often
stated that it was a blessing to use one's means
in such a worthy cause. But this money he did
receive came in handy in his old age. He desired
to show his appreciation, and since these people
had no records of their births in Denmark and
other genealogical data and had longed so much
to have this information, he sent back to the Old
Country and obtained many of these records for
them, for which they were most thankful.

There was so much contagion in the Valley
in those early years. Diphtheria had been rampant 
in Gunnison in November of 1879, at which 
time six of the brethren had been appointed as a
board of health to guard against the dread disease.
Schools were closed for a time until it was considered 
safe to recommence. Again in 1884 this
same disease had caused the people there "to be
diligent in the practice of sanitary rules". Meetings 
then were not discontinued but it was "considered 
wisdom to leave the children home." In
the fall of the year 1887 an epidemic of diphtheria
swept over the whole of Gunnison Valley. Many
people contracted this highly contagious disease.
<span id="page-302"></span>
Sore feverish throats were swabbed with alcohol
and blue vitriol in an effort to combat the dread
bacillus. Most all homes were visited by death.
Fatality among the children was exceedingly great,
sometimes three or four from a family. Some
adults also fell prey to this fearful malady. In
North Mayfield, during one of these epidemics,
five of the seven children of Simon and Martha
Hansen (she who had been the first teacher in the
United Order there) died of diphtheria within one
week. Three of them were buried in the same
grave. In Gunnison, children of the Ole H. and
Inger Hansen family, who had recently moved
from Christenburg, into a lovely new winter home
there, contracted this ravaging sickness and two
of them, Peter and Hanner, died of it that year.
Mixed feelings of fear and compassion filled the
hearts of the people as diphtheria spread from
home to home. The red flag of warning on so many
gate posts, all too often became a symbol of death.

Else K. Christensen was on the go during
that dreadful time. History has failed to record
the extent of her efforts, to this point, but merely
noted:-- "Mrs. Elsie (Else) Christensen is said
to have had 'great success' and Parlan McFarlane,
although not a doctor, was quite successful in 
treating the disease." It has often been quoted
that "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread".
In the case of the doctress Else K. this could be
applied a little differently; for here was one 
home-spun angel of mercy who pushed resolutely forward
into many stricken homes where most others feared
to go - saving a life here - giving hope and comfort
there - and leaving her benediction of service and
love wherever she went. Did she fear for her life
and those of her own children? Of course she did!
But she knew it was her duty and her destiny to
become involved, come what might. She must have
had great dedication and courage and still greater
faith. That none of her own family were afflicted
at this time seemed proof of the approbation of the
kind Heavenly Father to whom she so often and
fervently prayed.

Whether it was for some contagion, sore
affliction, pestering complaint, or for the
<span id="page-303"></span>
important work of bringing babies she was summoned, 
Else K. Christensen was almost always
well prepared. Sometimes she gathered and made
concoctions from smartweed, wormwood, horehound, 
yarrow and other herbs which grew wild in
the valley. She often used catnip, peppermint and
sage tea in her treatments. She was a specialist
with hot packs and mustard plasters. Among the
medical helps which she used freely and with great
skill were, besides the previously mentioned
"blood-letting knife", a variety of lances for boils
and a suction cup to draw the pus out. She kept
all her tools very sharp and in the best of condition, 
safe in her medical kit, ready for use at any
and all times. To the Christensen children Else's
brown satchel was a "mustn't touch it". To them
it held "magic things" with which their mother
treated the sick and the afflicted. It sometimes
held her medical journal as well, in which were
written the recipes for "magic cures", together
with a list of the babies she had brought and other
data pertaining to her profession.

Just about spring the next year Else made
the following entry in her journal;-- 'Victor
Madsen en datter den 14 March 1888." This
simple statement in no way indicated the part the
birth of this baby girl was to play in the lives of
Laurs and Else Christensen and their family. Ada
Lorena Madsen, for so the infant was later named,
was the fifth child of Victor August Hastrup Madsen
(adopted son of Bishop Christian August Madsen)
and his wife Sarah Olesen Madsen. Else worked
hard to save the life of this little child and as she
worked she prayed, for some malfunctioning of
her heart was evident from the start. With special
care some progress was made in the little one's
condition throughout the weeks following her birth,
but the mother, Sarah, failed to gain back her
health and strength after the ordeal. Else spared
nothing in her efforts to get Sister Madsen back
on her feet again, but to no avail. It was apparent
that the young mother could not get well. In
despair Sarah Madsen called Else Christensen to
her bedside and tearfully pled with her to take her
baby Ada to care for and raise when she was gone.
Who could have denied the last request of this
<span id="page-304"></span>
dying mother? Not Else!

Sarah Madsen passed away Friday 25 May
1888, less than two months before her 
twenty-eighth birthday. She was buried a few days later
in the Gunnison cemetery beside another baby
daughter, Almira, who had died at two years.
With the full consent of the bereaved husband,
Else took the two month eleven day old Ada Lorena
Madsen into her home and cared for the motherless
little girl as if she were her own. We have been
told that little Ada, though frail and sickly, was
very bright and of a very sweet nature and that the
nine Christensen children, as well as Laurs and
Else, took her to their hearts. This was especially
true of one year old Elvena, who adored Ada, and
the feeling seemed to be mutual between them.
They played by the hour together and Else even
dressed them alike when she could. People often
thought the two little girls were twins, although
Elvena had very blonde curls while Ada's were
very dark. Ada was not officially adopted by the
Christensens, yet she was much loved by them and
treated as their very own. No strings were attached
to her by the Madsen family. Her natural father
gave her foster parents this written 
statement:-- "I hereby give my consent for my daughter, Ada
Lorena Madsen, to be called by the name of the
people who raise her. - Victor A. Madsen." So
they changed the small girl's name to Ada Christensen.

For a little more than eleven years the
people of the Church, but more particularly the
Saints in Sanpete Valley, had awaited with great
anticipation the completion of the immense and
beautiful building that was being erected. On a
hill of solid stone jutting west into the valley from
the rugged Wasatch Mountains east of the city of
Manti, the magnificent structure had grown until
now it stood in all its glory on the crest of "Temple
Hill", its delicate towers patterned against the sky.
It appeared like a glittering jewel on the bosom of
the mountain range. Built of oolitic stone of a
warm cream or ivory color, which had been
quarried from these same mountains, it commanded
<span id="page-305"></span>
a superb view of the country round about, north,
south and west. It was impossible to imagine a
more eminent location for a temple and one affording 
greater opportunity for artistic and delightful
surroundings.

The building itself was 171 feet 6 inches long,
92 feet wide, and 79 feet high to the square, plus
the two towers reaching heavenward, the one on
the east 169 feet. These were thirty feet square
at the base but tapered upward. The walls of the
main building were 3 feet 6 inches thick at the
base, with 4-foot buttresses, diminishing to 3
feet at the square and the buttresses to about
2 feet 6 inches. The building itself, as well as
the towers, had ample window facilities. Adjoining 
the structure on the north was a heating plant
and annex. The grounds were terraced and planted
with vines, shrubs, trees and flowers. The public
highway ran past the temple from which the ascent
to the ground floor was over thirty feet, but a
sloping drive beginning at the north, passing under
part ofthe east edge of the building and finding an
outlet on the south, made the ascent easy. Two
lengthy flights of steps led up to the temple, a
great wide one of cement on the west and a narrow
one on the far south just east of the driveway.

The interior of the temple matched the
exterior in beauty and workmanship in every
degree, perhaps one of the most distinctive
features being the two spiral stairways of
choicest wood which had been so intricately
balanced as to need no center support at all.
The height of each of these was 95 feet from floor
to ceiling and they contained 150 steps apiece.
There were only five such unusual stairways in
the United States, including the two in this temple.
(Even today there are only five in the U. S. A.
and no other temple has the likes of these.)
Overall, the Manti temple had been a gigantic
undertaking and at the time was the finest structure 
yet to be erected in the Rocky Mountains,
although it was the third temple.

Out of the hearts, out of the foodstuffs, out
of the labors and sacrifices of these people this
temple had been built. A Sunday egg here, a
<span id="page-306"></span>
young calf there, a bushel of wheat gleaned by a
widow - it had all added up over the years to the
one million dollars that had been required to
build it. Now at last it was completed and the
hearts of the people were bursting with feelings
of thanksgiving as the day of its dedication drew
near. A three day celebration had been planned
and one can be sure every adult member in the
valley who was physically able, and could secure
a recommend from his or her Bishop, would
attend one or more of the inspirational meetings.
Numbers of the authorities from Salt Lake City
were expected, as well as caravans of church
leaders traveling in from other parts of the
Territory. Whereas at the time of the dedication
of the site eleven years before (25 Apr. 1877)
valley Saints had mostly come to Manti in slow
moving ox-drawn wagons, now they would be able
to come and go with faster teams and rigs.

On Monday, 21 May 1888, the Manti Temple
was dedicated by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. The
large assembly room, seating about 1,500, was
filled to overflowing. Men of the Priesthood were
seated on the right, the women on the left, as was
the case in all church meetings even well into the
nineteenth century. A regional choir had been
practicing for months for this occasion, under the
baton of Professor Smyth. "On the first day of the
religious gatherings in the temple, just as Professor 
Smyth was concluding the voluntary - a
selection from Mendelssohn - a number of the
Saints in the body of the hall and some of the
brethren in the west stand heard most heavenly
voices singing. It sounded to them as angelic, and
appeared to be behind and above them, and many
turned their heads in that direction wondering if
there were not another choir in some other part
of the building. There was no other visible choir
however. . . Some of the Saints saw the spirits of
Presidents Young and Taylor, J. M. Grant, and
others, in the temple, and the heads of some of
the speakers were surrounded by a halo of heavenly
light during the services. The Saints enjoyed a
spiritual feast extending through the three days,
and many shed tears of joy while listening to the
testimonies and admonitions of the servants of God.
<span id="page-307"></span>
There can be no question but that God has accepted
the Manti temple at the hands of his Saints and will
bless all who have in any degree assisted to build
it or who, not having the means to assist, have
said in their hearts, "I would have helped if I
could." (This quote was taken from The Millennial
Star, Vol. 50, No. 26, p. 405.) Perhaps some
said then, doubting, as some may say now, "Seeing's
believing'' - but did not Christ say, "one
must believe to see!"?

It is hard to think other than that the
Christensens and their relatives from Gunnison
were present at the dedication of the Manti
Temple, Christen, Anne, Pauline, Lars Myrup,
Laurs and even Else must have been in attendance,
though it took place just four days before the death
of Else's patient, the mother Sarah Madsen.
Possibly they were among those who heard the
invisible choir, or saw heavenly beings seated
among them. Less than six months later most of
the above took advantage of the marvelous opportunity 
and entered that magnificent edifice again,
this time to do work in behalf of some of their
departed loved ones. The "Spirit of Elijah" rested
upon them and the importance of "work for the
dead" was made manifest unto them. There was
no excuse for them to neglect this work now that
they had a temple near at hand; if they did, they
did it "at the peril of their own salvation", as the
prophets had said. In speaking of these things
during the dedication of the St. George Temple,
Brigham Young had stated:-- "Those who can see
the spiritual atmosphere can see that many are
still glued to the earth. They are lusting and
longing for the things of the earth, in which there
is no profit. While we ought to look after temporal
things, we should devote them all to the kingdom
of God. Where are the hearts of the people; where
are their forefathers? What are they doing for
their own salvation and for that of their forefathers?
. . . If we were awake to this great truth this house
would be crowded from Monday morning until
Saturday night. . . This temple has been built
that people can come and labor for their salvation
and that of their progenitors. . . What do you
suppose the fathers would say if they could speak
<span id="page-308"></span>
from the dead? Would they not say: 'We have lain
here thousands of years in the prison house, bound
and fettered in the association of the filthy and
corrupt.' If they had the power the very thunders
of heaven would resound in our ears. All the angels
of heaven are looking to this little handful of people.
When I think upon the subject I want the tongues of
seven thunders to awaken the people to action."

On Monday, 12 Nov. 1888, Christen Christensen 
and a number of his family made their way from
Gunnison to Manti by wagon and set up camp on the
grounds provided for that purpose just southwest of
the temple grounds. The next day Laurs, Pauline,
Anne and Christen himself went into the beautiful
temple and were baptized for dozens of their dead
kindred. For four days they labored in this sacred
building for their deceased relatives - brothers,
sisters, parents, grandparents - all were baptized,
endowed and sealed under the hands of the holy
priesthood. They did not forget to do the endowments 
for the gentle Karen and the daughter Petrine,
or for Karen's parents and relatives who were dead,
for Christen had procured the records of them by
correspondence with her people. On Nov. 14, 1888
they had the joy of fulfilling one of their most
sacred dreams, that of being sealed together as a
family for time and all eternity. Christen's two
daughters, Nielsine, or Sena, and Caroline came
into the temple that day for this occasion. Caroline,
the only one of Christen's and Anne's children not
born in the covenant was sealed to them there.

Then Christen's and Karen's children, both the
living and the dead, were sealed to them - all but
the first son, Christen, who was still living in 
far-off Denmark, apparently with no interest whatsoever 
in the purposes of the Most High. Christen
Sr. stood for himself in this last sealing, as in the
first, while Laurs, Pauline and Sena not only stood
for themselves but also alternated for their dead
brothers and sisters, Peter C., Niels C., Maren,
Ane Marie and the two Petrines. Anne stood for
the gentle Karen and Daniel H. Wells, first President 
of the Manti Temple, performed the sealings.[^7]
Sena herself had risen from a bed of sorrow to come
to the Temple that November day. Exactly two
weeks before she had laid away a five weeks old

[^7]: This wonderful sealing session of 14 Nov 1888 is recorded at the end of Christen Christensen's temple record book (p. 58).  It indicates which living children were proxy for their deceased siblings: Pauline for Maren and the first Petrine, Nielsine for Ane Marie and the second Petrine, and Laurs for Peter and Niels.  Christen's wife Ane was proxy for his first wife Karen.  D. H. Wells sealer, John Alder and Thomas Higgs witnesses, M. F. Farnsworth recorder.

baby son. This had been the fourth of five small
sons with whom she had been parted by death in
the past four years. Did the ceremonies in that
glorious temple give her renewed hope and courage 
for the future?

In those early days the Saints did the work
for their own dead, or hired it done by other
Saints. Christen and Anne were most faithful in
their genealogical responsibilities. They wrote
often to the Old Country for records of their
departed kin and friends and went to the temple
regularly to act as proxies in their behalf.
According to their daughter Caroline, the practice
of going to the Manti temple continued with her
parents as long as her elderly father was able,
for she wrote:-- "He was not only kind and considerate 
of the living but did what he could for
the dead. He and mother went from Gunnison
to Manti by team many a Tuesday and came back
Saturday. They took their provisions with them
and camped, doing temple work for their dead
kindred and friends. They did this for many weeks
and years, when father was not busy in the fields,
farming." The Manti temple records show that
Christen and Anne Christensen worked consistently
in that sacred building for the next nine years,
accomplishing a great amount of vicarious work
for their dead.

## A CLEAR CALL

Else had not accompanied her husband's people to the temple excursion that November 1888, for she was busy with the sick. Though she longed to go there in behalf of her own departed loved ones she had so little knowledge and such incomplete
information about them that she was completely unprepared for this noble service. Even that which she knew of her very own parents was scant indeed. These things tugged at her mind and hung heavily on her heart, but she had so few free moments it
seemed. Letters to her people in Denmark for genealogical material had been most unrewarding--they were seldom if ever answered. Else was well aware of the statement made by the Prophet Joseph Smith that--"The greatest responsibility in this
world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead." She wanted to keep the commandments above all else. She must try harder.

So towards the end of that year she wrote again to her sisters and brother in Denmark, sending them Yuletide greetings together with a carefully worded request for additional information on their parents and also on their own families. She mailed these letters with a sincere prayer in her<span id="page-311"></span> heart. It would likely take months to receive answers - if she ever did. Meanwhile she went courageously on with her work of raising her family, including the sickly little Ada, ushering new babies into the world and succoring the distressed. But her mind was often turned to her kindred.

What happiness was hers when she received the following communication from Denmark (as translated from the Danish[^8]):-- 

[^8]: In the translation of the letter on p. 311, one son, Johannes, was accidentally omitted and his birth date assigned to the next oldest, Hans Tausen.  It should read, "Hans Tausen M. Skaarup, born 1 Feb 1877; Johannes M. Skaarup, born 28 July 1878."  This omission has been corrected here.  (The middle initial M. of the original has been expanded to Mikkelsen for each child.)

> Thorsted, Denmark - March 1889.

> Jens Mikkelsen Skaarup born 11 Feb. 1873; Ane Marie Mikkelsen Skaarup born 22 Feb. 1874, died when three weeks old; Kristen Mikkelsen Skaarup born 4 May 1875; Hans Tavsen Mikkelsen Skaarup born 1 Feb. 1877; Johannes Mikkelsen Skaarup born 28 July 1878; Kristian Mikkelsen Skaarup born 27 Jan. 1880; Frederik Mikkelsen Skaarup born 3 Jan. 1882; Otto Mikkelsen Skaarup born 12 Mar. 1883, died when five days old; Maren Mikkelsen Skaarup born 2 Apr. 1884; Holger Mikkelsen Skaarup born 16 Oct. 1885; Svend Mikkelsen Skaarup born 19 Jan. 1887. -- Yes, dear sister, I have given you the names and birthdates of all of our children which are the best we own. We and you of course have the same number. They are all well and so I can do nothing else but marvel at seeing them. I was with Mads and Stine and we decided that I should write alone this time so that the letter wouldn't be too fat. I am to greet you from them and say from Mads that he will do what he can to accomplish what you require from him. They will each write in a few days.

> Sister Marie is moving to Thisted and she will have a good amount of work. Stine lives in Thisted. Her husband is named Svend Poulsen. He is a carpenter and they have six healthy, delightful children and two dead. Mads also has six but they have had ten. He lives in Tingstrup, Thisted Parish, and they have two good dwellings. In the summer they live in Thisted.

> Our father died 10 May 1878. When mother was dead he sold the house but kept that little room in Norhaa, but he spent a lot of his time here with us. The last time he left here he wasn't very well. He lay in his bed most of a month after. Mikkel<span id="page-312"></span>and I drove over to Norhaa to see him two days before he died. He was very sick but he was happy and contented, so I have the best of hope for him. And now I will close for this time. When your letter came the teacher Carl was here. He was going to travel to America in April to visit two of his brothers who lived here for eighteen years. I asked him, after I read your letter, if he would visit my sister in America.

> Love from Mikkel and Karen Skaarup

It was almost a month before another Danish letter came for Else and her fingers trembled as she opened it:-- 

> Tingstrup, Denmark - April 1889. 

> Dear Sister:- I have got that done which you asked me to do. I have been to the Priest at Hvidbjerg
and he was very good to look back one and one-half centuries but he could hardly go farther as the books at that point were just loose leaves and almost illegible writing. As you can see the mothers of our parents are not mentioned in this information he gave me, which I enclose; only Kristen Kristensen and wife and Kristen Hviid and wife - but I suppose you can remember that father's mother is Karen and mother's mother is Else. Our mother died 10 July 1872 and was buried on the 16 and father died the 10 May 1878 and was buried on the 15th. 

> I shall now tell you a little about what has happened to me in my way through life until now. I suppose that you remember that Kristen, in his last days, was stirred to look inward into his sinful heart and consider the Lord's goodness to repentant sinners and whatever else there is to believe in. Immediately afterwards we other brother and sisters came in touch with the same way of life initiated by Grundtvig and a revival. I was then at High School on Mors and I was very happy to listen to the lectures which were held, speaking of the lives and experiences of the teachers. This was in the winter of 1868. In the fall I went to High School down by Kilding (Askov Hajskole) and stayed there for six months. In 1875 I came to Thorsted where sister Karen lives, to hold school for some children. There I became<span id="page-313"></span> acquainted with a girl from Gjaerup, who worked for Karen, and it soon became clear to us that God had led us together. We became engaged the same year and were married on the 25th of May 1876.

> On the 18th of March 1877 we had our first son and he was christened and named Askel Hvid (I had by then started to let myself be called Mads Kristjan Hvid.) On the 16th of Feb. 1879 we had our first girl, who was christened Valborg Hvid. On the 11 Aug. 1880 the other girl was born and received in her christening the name of Kirstine Hvid (for mother). On the 24 Oct. 1881 we had a boy, he was christened and called Kristjan Hvid (for father). On the 11 Oct. 1883 another boy arrived and was christened and called Jens Peter but he died at 5 months. On the 5th Nov. 1884 a girl was born. She was christened Marie Hvid but died when ten days old. A few days later my wife took ill and spent her time in bed, partly at home and partly in Thisted, for a year and a half and didn't have enough strength to turn over in bed by herself. But on Nov. 9th 1885, two little ones came, a boy and a girl. They were christened and called after the other two who had died, Marie and Jens Peter. On 3 Feb. 1888 we had a boy. He was christened Johannes Hvid and he died at five months old. On 22 Feb. 1889 our tenth child arrived, a wonderful girl. She was christened and named after our sister who died, Edel Petrea Hvid. I forgot to mention that the twin, Jens Peter, died at four months of age.

> Else Marie Pedersen is my wife's name. She is now well enough that she got a sewing machine this last winter and sews for all our little ones. Yesterday she got her loom set up and wants to start weaving. It has now been unused for nearly seven years. Our attitude towards the previously mentioned movement, which we were so happy about, is otherwise now than it was before because we think it to be superficial and not serious enough, for these are serious times we are living in. We question if it is the spirit of the world that is leading us or if it is the good Holy Ghost. It seems to me that it appears to be the spirit or power of the world that is ruling. But thank God we believe<span id="page-314"></span> in an All Ruling God and even if it is dark for us we can sing 'The Lord is with us' and we shall fear nothing.

> Mads Kristjan Hvid - Tingstrup by Thisted

On Tue. 7 May that year of 1889 Christen and Anne went to Manti on another temple excursion and this time Else K. went with them, and of course they took their provisions along and stayed at the campground near the temple. They were in the temple for three days, during which time Else not only assisted the others with the work for some of their departed but had the great joy of being baptized and endowed for her own mother, Mette, and also for Mette's mother, her own Grandmother Else Andersen (Hvid) for whom she herself had been named. Perhaps it was then, in the beautiful Manti temple, realizing again how little knowledge she really had of her own progenitors, the thought first came to her that she should return to Denmark and search out the records of her dead ancestors as well as those of her living kin, while she yet had her own people in the Old Country. It was a startling idea to say the least. How could it ever be accomplished ?

Else had hardly been able to take time off from her numerous duties that 7th to 9th of May to go to the temple. Bringing babies alone was a time-consuming business in itself, considering the fact that she often was called to assume almost full responsibility for both mother and babe until the mother herself was up and around again. That May was a busy month for Else K., according to the entries in her medical journal:-- "Hans C. Hansen datter 4 Mai 1889; Lars Olsen son 12 Mai 1889; Henry Jensen datter 27 Mai 1889." Indeed she was a very busy midwife and much in demand, as this journal attested, for she listed in it 36 babies brought by her in the year 1888 and another 36 in 1889 - quite a concidence, but also a record of one of the many, many labors in which she was engaged during those busy years. A good practice, however, made it possible for her to begin to save a little of her income for the future,<span id="page-315"></span> whatever that future held.

While Else was busy with her medical practice, Laurs took a great deal of the responsibility of the family. They nearly always had a hired girl and especially one, Christine or "Sena" Lund of Manti, who had been born near Else's hometown in Denmark and come across the plains with them in the Abner Lowery Company as a very small child. Else and Emma too were getting big enough to help some, especially with the little girls, Elvena and Ada. But that they missed Else in the home is a certainty, according to the son Albert:-- "Our home was always a place of love and peace. Contention and quarreling were uncommon. While father was a patient, kind and affectionate father, our mother was the life and soul of the home. As a child, when I had been away and returned, if mother was not in the livingroom or kitchen I would wander from room to room and if I could not find her I would leave; the house seemed too lonely and empty without her. Mother's complete confidence in me and the rest of the children was a shield to us against dishonorable things."

Laurs was also away from home at times, herding sheep, working on the railroad, freighting, etc., to bring in a little extra, but mostly he farmed on his forty acres or worked about the place in Gunnison. They had pigs, chickens, geese, a few sheep, cows and horses, with the pens, sheds and coops to house them. They had a good sized patch of alfalfa on their place, a few plum trees and currant bushes, but their pride and joy was a large, well-kept garden which supplied so much of the family's food. Laurs always ploughed and got the ground ready each year and helped plant it and irrigated, but it was Else's garden and she was a fine gardner. She weeded, tended and fussed over the garden and tried to have the first new potatoes, green peas, green onions, and radishes each year, and she usually did.

Most of the people in Gunnison had wells by 1887 and Laurs was determined to have one on his place. His son Albert tells how he got the well, in his memoirs:-- "At first we used water<span id="page-316"></span>from the open ditch the same as the neighbors. I well remember when my father arranged to have a well dug a little west of the old house and northwest of the new. He showed Mr. William Wasden where he desired the well to be, but Mr. Wasden wanted to be sure that the place selected was a place where water could be found, so he held in front of him a forked limb, one hand upon each prong and the main stick pointing directly in front of him. He walked over to the place where father had located the site of the well. This was on a
rather high area above the old home and the land sloped eastward from here. He said that the stick failed to indicate that there was water to be found there. He walked all over the lot to the north and whenever he got near the north boundary the end of the stick would point, indicating (to him) the presence of water. Father went about his work. Other members of the family, including myself, were interested observers. Finally Brother Wasden approached father to render his decision. He said it would be useless to dig the well at the place indicated by him. After some discussion father said he didn't care where the water was, he wanted the well dug at the place he had suggested in the beginning. Brother Wasden protested, stating that there would be no water there. 'I don't care where the water is father repeated, 'here is where I want you to dig the well!' That finally settled the matter and Wasden, with apparent forebodings, started to dig the well as directed. It was rather a slow process as it was necessary, after the first few feet, to dig through rock. In the course of weeks, however, Wasden had dug to about thirty feet when to his great amazement, almost consternation, water gushed forth in a veritable stream so that it became impossible to sink the well farther. Wasden cleaned out the well as best he could and then was windlassed out of the hole with his tools. The well soon had some six to eight feet of water in it, ample for all of our domestic uses. That well served the family as long as any of us lived there. As far as I know it may still be there yet." Gunnison water with its strong mineral taste was supposed to be rich in magnesium, said to be most healthful for people.<span id="page-317"></span> It was not until about 1910 that most people there had water piped into their houses.

The Christensen's new home in Gunnison was a block west of the Relief Society Hall, which building had been started in 1877. In June the foundation had been laid on the northwest part of the public square. The main hall, 30 by 60 feet, had walls 2 ft. thick and 16 ft. high. This part was finished in time to hold Sabbath meeting in it the first Sunday in December. A two-story 12 by 20 ft. "T" was completed later on the north end of the hall and provided a stage and, on the second floor, a long assembly room which was used for various church meetings as well as school. The sisters gleaned wheat, gathered "Sunday eggs", made quilts and other articles to raise money. They paid $1,300 on the erection of their hall and another $1,000 to help build a storage granary and fences. Some material was donated by the brethren. The upper room had seven windows, five facing north and two facing south. Four long rows of benches extended the entire length of the room and in the middle was a large pot-bellied stove and an oversized woodbox.

This place of church meetings was completed by the time the Christensens had moved back to Gunnison in 1880 and was especially convenient for them after the they moved to west Gunnison. Besides all Sunday meetings, the Priesthood met Saturday afternoon and night there, the Relief Society held monthly meetings, the Young Ladies Retrenchment Society met twice a month and the Young Mens Mutual met weekly. Prayer meeting was held on Thursday nights and Scandinavian meeting Wednesdays. The adult and juvenile choirs each practiced one night a week and one night was for amusements.

On Friday, 15 Nov. 1889, Laurs and Else Christensen and their three oldest sons, Christian 22, Andrew 20 and Joseph 18&frac12;, went to the Manti Temple together for the purpose of being sealed together as parents and children for all eternity. The three had not been born in the covenant as had the others of the Christensen children, so it was necessary that this sacred ordinace be performed<span id="page-318"></span>in their behalf. This was done in all solemnity by Manti Temple President Daniel H. Wells. It must have been a soul-filling experience for each of them. For Else herself, who was not yet sealed to her own parents, it may have been a strong reminder of her unfulfilled responsibilities to her kindred dead. In fact each new visit to that beautiful edifice must have given new impetus to her dream about returning to her native land in search of the genealogical records of her people, past and present. Though she had a great responsibility to the living she also must have felt the urgency of her responsibility to her dead growing within her bosom.

That she discussed these things with Laurs and even with their older children, may readily be imagined. She may not have discussed with them, however, her recurring dream that perhaps she herself might be instrumental in bringing her own people the message of the Gospel. This thought she could not banish. As the days and weeks sped, what had begun as little more than a dream began to shape itself into a possibility. As she began to view a trip back to Old Denmark it began to loom as an almost staggering undertaking. But even as Else weighed the situation and prayed for guidance in overcoming the problems, she began making tentative plans to go. The voice of her own destiny was being heard amid the din.

Inquiries were made about the cost of such a journey, for money was a big consideration. Though business for her had been good the past few years and she had saved some, she would still be forced to borrow additional. Passport requirements were investigated. Fortunately she was an American, she and Laurs having secured their Certificates of Citizenship the same day (20 Feb. 1882) in the First Judicial District Court of the United States, Utah Territory, issued at Manti. Else talked to returned Danish missionaries - "yes", they advised her, "Saints going back to the Old Country on visits often traveled there with Outgoing Elders." Laurs and the children encouraged her in every way possible - they could take care of things at home
they agreed. Having gone this far Else decided<span id="page-319"></span> she had better write to Karen and Mads about the possibility of a homecoming - and to Stine and Marie. Would she be welcome among them there in Denmark?

Well before an answer came back definite plans for Else's trip were under way. She had applied to the church authorities in Salt Lake City for permission to travel with any missionaries who might be leaving for the Scandinavian Mission sometime in September 1890, after most of the children would be settled in school. The oldest daughter Elsie had agreed to remain home from school that year and thirteen year old Emma had promised to help, especially with small Elvena. Of course Laurs would be on hand and a woman could be brought in to help, if necessary. The photograph for Else's passport had been taken, and since it had been definitely decided that she should take along their foster daughter Ada, she too was in the picture. There was no other way but to take the little two-and-a-half year invalid with her, for she had made a solemn promise to the dying Sarah Madsen that she would care for her child, and the little girl was far too frail to leave to the chance care of others.

Then a letter came from Else's youngest sister, the twenty-eight year old Marie - still unwed (translated from the Danish):-- "Thisted, 15 July 1890. Dear Sister Else: Thank you very much for your letter and thanks because you are thinking of visiting us. We cannot measure the joy it will bring to us. I have sometimes said, 'I wonder if Else won't come and surprise us?'. 'No' the others have said, 'that could absolutely not be!' But look now if it hasn't almost happened. We had thought it would almost be too big a surprise and so avoided the disappointment in that way. But now my dear, dear sister, we sometimes imagine the moment when you shall come and then believe me we are filled with joy - but then when you leave again it will be hard. You must tell Kristjan hello for us and say that we think he is magnificent to give you, his wife, the liberty to make such a journey - and may the good Lord bless him for it. And if it so be that it<span id="page-320"></span> comes true, then we will make it as pleasant as we can for you and make sure you get safely home again to the far west, for that is where you belong. Yes, may the Lord give you strength and courage so that this fall will bring you good woman here.

"The old ones want to live until you come; namely Niels Vorup and Kristen Larsen of Norhaa. Yes, here is joy all over at the thought of your homecoming. I have so many greetings for you! June 6th I went to Hordum to visit Aunt Maren. She takes care of one of the officials 'Sognefogeden' in the Parish there. While there I also went to 'Old Aunts' and then, since Maren had told me that Mette, who is married to Jens Krog of Spaels, had hurt her thigh, I decided to visit her also. The following day I went through Norhaa and although I hadn't been there since not long after you were here, I still could recognize everything. I went to Kjallerup to see Kristen and Maren Hvid and got these names I am enclosing for you. They said to tell you hello. I then went to Mette's. She is a little better but still in bed. She has four sons and a daughter. One son, Anders, lives in the home for poor people. He is married and has five children, although I think his wife is a little strange. Another son is a bricklayer and lives at Thyholm and one is a grocer in Copenhagen. One son is at home to help Jens Krog. The daughter, Ane Marie, is twenty-eight years old and a nice, good girl and so clean and happy. She went with me to Lavst Lykkes, for I wanted to tell Kristine about you. She said to send you her love. She has been quite broken down with sorrow. They have had four children but about three years ago one boy in his fourteenth year was drowned down in a brook. Then a little girl died and now they have only a boy and a girl. It has struck her hard. Lavst has been sick for sometime with an abdominal infection and she worries about that too, as he has it so often. Her husband is from Svendborg but this year he has bought Uncle's whole house so now they are living in Aarup. I visited them on my way home for I wanted to go by train from Snested to Sjoring; for now we have trains in Jutland you know. One runs from Thisted to Struer - the stations are Thisted, Sjoring, Turbol, Snested, Hordum, <span id="page-321"></span>Bedsted, Hurup, Ydby, Lyngs, Hvidbjerg and Oddesund du Nord. However the train runs so slow you almost get places as fast when Mikkel Skaarup delivers his meat by horse.

"Yes, you can believe it will be nice when you come and I guess I am the one who can, best of all, close my door and go with you - so you shouldn't be so anxious to get me married off! But believe me little Else, I have had my part of trials and tribulations but these can wait to be told until we can be together in a short while, if it may happen. But I have lived as rich a youth as is granted only a few. I have enjoyed a good life ever since my earliest childhood and I will continue to the end. I pray the Lord every day that he will give me strength and that he will lead me, whether it be through married or single life.

"Tell Kristjan (they called Laurs that) 'Hello', we would like to know him personally. Karen has a good spacious cottage. There is room for much good at a place like that - it is the best place I know. I have spent many happy days there. But you must not think anything else but that sister Stine's and brother Mads' homes are happy and pretty too. It is fortunate that you write on good paper for believe me your letters are getting read diligently. You apologize for your letters without reason, but ours need tolerance. It makes us and many others happy that you remember your native language so well. We are all fine. I do not know if they will all write this time, if so their letters should come today so they can be sent together.  You have all come closer to us lately. My address is - Cook Marie Andersen, c/o Bricklayer Hansen, Stationsvejen No. 310, Thisted, Jutland, Denmark."

Else's eyes were wet long before she had finished this letter. All the homesickness of a quarter of a century welled up within her and spilled over. Oh to hear the sound of the sea and taste its salt on her lips again - to greet her sisters and brother Mads once more - to lock arms and walk and talk with them as of yore - to sit together in the quiet of the evening and watch the moon come up out of nowhere! But there was<span id="page-322"></span> little time then for reminiscing and less for weeping, so much had to be accomplished in so short a time. She delivered four babies in July and another four in August, including one more son to the oft bereaved Sena and Anthony Madsen, 28 Aug. 1890. In September she delivered another little one, a son, to one Jens Madsen, then she set aside her brown kit for a time in favor of a small trunk and a large valise, well packed for a three months trip to Little Denmark. And then the time had flown, last minute advice was in order all around and
goodbys were being said. Did three-and-a-half year old Elvena cry and cling to her departing mother, finding it difficult to understand why she should be left at home while two-and-a-half year old Ada was being taken along?

Whether Laurs took Else, little Ada and their luggage by wagon to Salt Lake City to join the group of L. D. S. missionaries with whom they were to travel, or whether he dropped them off at the nearest railroad terminal at Indianola, we are uncertain - probably the latter. Nevertheless the two joined the group of thirteen Elders who left Salt Lake City by eastbound train just prior to mid-September 1890, which included the following brethren: Edward H. Andersen of Ogden; Jens N. Hansen, John O. Rosenkrantz and Pehr Cronquist of Logan; Harold F. Lilenquist and Michael Johnson of Hyrum; Peter H. Sorensen, Jens H. Kofoed and Thor C. Nielsen of Brigham City; Pehr N. Pehrson of West Jordan; Andrew Hansen and Andres C. Johnson of Pleasant Grove, all from Utah, and Christian H. Poulsen of Franklin, Idaho. These were more than a third of the total thirty-six missionaries who left Zion to serve in the Scandinavian Mission that entire year of 1890.

It should be remembered that the past few years in Zion had been a period when the great anti-polygamy drive had been gaining momentum among the enemies of the Church, and at its height had taken on more the appearance of an anti-Mormon crusade. Having commenced in earnest in 1884, under cover of the Edmunds law, it had been carried on from then with great hostility and
increasing vigor, not only by individuals and <span id="page-323"></span>anti-Mormon groups but by Federal officers and courts in Utah and Idaho as well. Arrests and imprisonments in the hundreds each year had continued unabated. The fines collected were enormous. The Utah Penitentiary had been constantly filled with the brethren who were found guilty of infractions of the anti-polygamy laws. Under provisions of the Edmund-Tucker act, the government had taken possession of the Church offices and a
wholesale confiscation of Church property threatened. In fact, the question of whether or not the Church could be robbed of its property by the government had even been laid before the supreme tribunal of the country; and also the question of whether its individual members could be robbed of their civil and political rights because of their religious beliefs.

The close of the year 1889 and beginning of 1890, political developments in Salt Lake City became highly demonstrative. The Liberal Party, representing the anti-Mormon population, began carrying on a most vigorous and at times vicious campaign against the Church in general, but more particularly the incumbent Peoples Party, which was supported by the Saints. Truly the political pot was boiling in Utah the beginning of the year 1890. The election was held of 10 February 1890 and we turn to historian Andrew Jenson's Church Chronology to find out how at least the Saints felt about it:-- "The municipal election in Salt Lake City, for which so much planning had been done, resulted in victory to the Liberals who, through the grossest frauds, managed to obtain possession of the City government. . . Sat. 15 Feb. - Ex-Judge Orlando W. Powers was banquetted by the Liberals in Salt Lake City and presented with $10,000 as a reward for manipulating the Liberal municipal campaign. . . Wed. Feb. 19 - There was a grand Liberal jollification with parade and fireworks held in Salt Lake City." Thus the civil control of Salt Lake City, as was also true of Ogden and a few other Utah communities, passed from the hands of the Peoples Party to those of the Liberal Party, or anti-Mormon element; and even before the tumult and shouting died, nearly all the civil rights left to the Saints were<span id="page-324"></span>threatened by anti-Mormon legislation. And so things stood in the "Promised Land" as Else and little Ada joined the company of missionaries who left Salt Lake City, Utah bound for Copenhagen, Denmark.

That the impact of this situation in Zion should have been felt in far-off Scandinavia seems unusual, nevertheless it was, according to Albert L. Zobell Jr., in his "Under the Midnight Sun", from which we quote:-- "The enforcement of the anti-polygamy laws against the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had its effect in the Scandinavian countries, especially after the American Ambassadors and Counsels abroad received their instructions not to extend any protection to American citizens who were engaged in missionary work in the interest of the Church. The civil authorities on the island of Bornholm, Denmark, were the first to issue edicts of banishment against the Elders and others followed, including those in the city of Aalborg. Scurrilous articles were published in Copenhagen newspapers and those in Bornholm and other places, slandering the Saints and their doctrines. Lutheran Priests gave illustrated lectures against the Church and anti-Mormon stories could be heard on every hand. Anton H. Lund, then President of the Scandinavian Mission, called on the United States Minister in Denmark and asked him if American citizens could be banished from that country without a trial, as they had been. He received little satisfaction in the answer, "I believe they can; there is some law that gives them arbitrary power to expel foreigners." So even abroad the Saints were not protected; it began to look as if the Elders from Zion would not be permitted to continue their missionary work in Denmark since the government had decided to banish them.

The year 1889 had begun with new mobbings and threatened violence to the Mormon missionaries and their congregations. More of the Elders were advised to leave the country, and did. But on the whole the intelligent Danish citizens, and even most of the Danish authorities, knew well that the Danish Saints were a loyal and law-abiding people, <span id="page-325"></span>sustaining the government and taking no part in the political agitations of the day. This went a long way in finally convincing the authorities that banishment of the Elders was not in keeping with the general spirit of freedom of which the Danes were intensely proud. And so it stood in Denmark when the group of travelers from Salt Lake City, including Else K. Christensen, reached Copenhagen 28 Sept. 1890.

One of their number, Elder Edward H. Anderson, immediately succeeded Brother Fjeldsted as President of the mission there. Elders Thor C. Nielsen and Andrew Hansen were appointed to labor in the Aalborg Conference. It was to this area of Jutland that Else herself was going. How different this brisk two-and-a-half weeks trip to Denmark must have seemed to her when compared to the five-months-long journey of twenty-four years before, when she had left there and gone west by sailing vessel and oxdrawn wagon train. Though she traveled "3. Klasse" on the east-going ocean liner, her accommodations must have seemed almost "regal"
when compared with those afforded by the "Old Kenilworth" of long ago.

We cannot help but be amazed when we think of this courageous, undaunted woman, now nearing her forty-fourth year, going forth with a sickly child on one arm and her bulging handbag on the other, directing the disposition of her other luggage as she transfered from American train, to steamship, to Danish train, canal boat or ferry, as the case demanded, or cared for the food requirements and other personal needs of little Ada and herself as well. Did her mind sometimes find time to dwell on prospective answers she might give to her Danish kinfolk when they asked about Mormon polygamy? She knew well that her relatives would be "up on things". She would have to face the issue as squarely as possible. We wonder how long it was before she learned that four days before her company had landed in Copenhagen, on 24 Sept. 1890, President Wilford Woodruff, under
divine inspiration, had issued his famous "manifesto", advising the Saints "to refrain from <span id="page-326"></span>contracting any marriage, forbidden by the laws of the land", and also that the same had been accepted by the unanimous vote of the Saints in attendance at the semi-annual conference of the church, Oct. 6 that year in Salt Lake City.

How wonderful for her to be in Old Denmark once again. . . Land of red flags with white crosses whipping in the October breeze in every public square and from every sailing craft upon the many waters. . . Land of amber, green seawashed islands, blue fjords and bays. . . Ancient land of her fathers, even back to the Vikings of Old. . . Land of the beautiful Limfjord which caressed the eastern coast of Thy. . . Land of bells ringing from towers and churches! The only church bell ringing in all of Sanpete Valley, U.S.A., as far as Else K. was aware, was the one now hanging in the belfry of the new Presbyterian
Church in Gunnison. She missed bells. 

## WITH FLAGS FLYING

Word of her hour of coming had gone ahead to her loved ones there. When she arrived at the railway station in the beautiful city of Thisted, on Jutland, she was met by the husband of her oldest sister Karen, Mikkel Skaarup. Though they had never met he had doubtless been directed to "look for the woman with the child on her arm". He had come in a beautiful carriage with a coal black team of horses and soon they were riding through the countryside of Thy, headed a bit north and some three miles west from Thisted, to the village of Thorsted, where Mikkel and Karen lived with their eight sons and one daughter, ranging in ages from seventeen to three years. The Skaarups owned a nice roomy cottage and a big farm in Thorsted. It was harvest time - soon they would be threshing their grain.

When they entered the village and drove past the white church and out to the Skaarup place, Danish flags were flying from cottages and flagpoles. "What Danish holiday or celebration is this?" asked Else, as she viewed them, "We fly<span id="page-327"></span> the flags because our lost sister has returned to us", answered Mikkel, "why shouldn't we celebrate?" And what a festival it must have been when Else was reunited with her three sisters and her brother Mads; for we have been told that they were all gathered there to greet her. Then she needs must meet their families, for they too had all come. Besides Karen's and Mikkel's nine children there were Mads' frail wife Else and their six living children, two boys and four girls of ages one-and-a-half to thirteen-and-a-half, and Stena's husband, Svend Poulsen, and their three daughters and three sons from fifteen years to five months old. It was difficult to straighten out all their names! Marie of course had no one - but she made up for it in most loving greetings. Yes, all had come to see the much-talked-of Aunt Else from America and her small foster daughter Ada. Wonderful children they were too, thought Else, but none any finer than her own six sons and three daughters back in Zion!

And back in Zion midsummer of that year, the Board of Examiners for Church Schools, with the approval of President Wilford Woodruff, had chosen Gunnison as one of the places to hold three-day examinations for prospective teachers. The exercises had been held July 28-29-30, 1890, in the Relief Society Hall, with Dr. Karl G. Maeser presiding and educators from Randolph, Bear
River, Wasatch and Sevier conducting tests on the theory and practice of teaching theology, grammar and composition, orthography, elocution, geography, history, hygiene, arithmetic, bookkeeping, penmanship, drawing and music. This event had been looked upon with great interest inasmuch as it had been the first of the kind ever held in Zion. Joseph Y. Jensen was one
of the Sanpete Valley residents to apply and be granted a teachers license at that time. 

Seminary teaching commenced that fall in Gunnison and this was held in the upper room of the Relief Society Hall. Joseph Y. Jensen was appointed Principal. The Bible was studied on Mondays and Thursdays, the Book of Mormon on<span id="page-328"></span> Tuesdays and Fridays, and Wednesday was testimony day. Of course numbers of other subjects were taught in addition to theology, including Domestic Science for the young women. On Friday nights the Philosophical Society presented lectures, readings, musicals, etc., and these were great affairs. 

Albert Christensen was one of the some seventy-five students attending classes and activities that fall and recalled some of his experiences in these words:-- "In the fall I started school at the Gunnison Seminary. I greatly enjoyed my work. While I was a little rusty as a student, I soon began to find myself. One day we had as a lesson the learning of the names of all the countries of South America and also the capitols of those countries. It happened that either by neglect or for some other cause I was unprepared. It was a surprise to me to find that the entire class likewise was unprepared. The teacher said, 'If Albert can't get the lesson you may all be excused'. I concluded that if the teacher had such confidence in me I would see to it in the future that I was prepared. . . This was about the first year that I had engaged in social activity such as dancing and other public entertainment. Needless to say it opened up to me a new world. It was a happy year both at home and at school. My mother had gone to Denmark to visit her people but returned sometime during the year. My sisters Elsie and Emma, who helped care for the home, had seemingly grown up during my absence. My father was always handy with home duties and was most agreeable at all times."

Among the many other students to attend the Gunnison Seminary that fall and winter of 1890/91, besides Albert, were his brothers Andrew and Joseph, as well as Christen's and Anne's daughter Caroline and sons Andrew and John T., and Miss
Roxie Bartholomew of Fayette. Albert's older brother Andrew, who had been out of school for a number of years, had begun to realize the fallacy of not having an education, as is told by his daughter Edythe:-- "More than once I've heard father<span id="page-329"></span> tell of leaving home at age thirteen to work. It was in the employ of one Julius Christensen. It was in the solitude of the mountains, while watching his employer's sheep, that Andrew dreamed his dreams and made his resolves - he would re-enter school! A strapping young man, older and taller than most of his classmates, he came back to face the lower classroom of Gunnison Seminary, where he buckled down to work in earnest."

Albert's sister Elsie tells of her enrolling in the Seminary about mid-term, as follows:--"At age fourteen (1889) I went to the Snow Academy in Ephraim, which had been founded the year before, on 5 Nov. 1888. My brother Joseph also attended then. This was a preparatory and intermediate school. In the fall of the next year (1890) I kept house for my father and family while mother and a foster child went to Denmark to visit her folks. Her family there in Denmark celebrated the return of 'their lost sister'. After she returned home I started to attend the Seminary in the Gunnison Ward. Joseph Jensen was the teacher. This was in January 1891." So as it was, all of Laurs and Else's nine children were living at home while she herself was visiting in far -off Scandinavia - that is all but the oldest son Christian, who was away with the sheep. Six, and later seven, were in school. Nothing made this couple happier than to see their offspring seeking after their educations.

Else spent the better part of three delightful months visiting the land of her birth and the loved ones of her youth. There were plenty of babytenders to watch little Ada and give her freedom to visit all around. True to her word, it was usually her unmarried sister Marie who had closed her door and gone along with her to visit the "old ones" and all their other living kinfolk in Thy. Before Else had left her home in Gunnison she had taken her scissors and hurriedly snipped out eighteen blank pages from her medical journal (those between 35 and 71). These she had placed in her handbag and brought with her, and as she traveled on foot, or by Danish train, carriage or wagon from village to village and cottage to<span id="page-330"></span> cottage greeting her relatives, she had questioned them and jotted down names, places and dates of births, and any death dates of parents and children in each particular family, until these pages were filled. Although most greeted her with exuberant affection, none would have ought to do with the doctrines of Mormonism. This was particularly so when she visited her brother-in-law Christen, down near Hurup, which she had faithfully promised both Laurs and Christen Sr. she would do. Though she received scant enough welcome at his home, nevertheless she wrote down the name and other information about his wife, Else Maria, and their two daughters with the rest, and accepted a photograph of the four to take back to his people in America.

She wept at the graves of her parents in the churchyard at Norhaa; gazed once more upon the cottage in Kjallerup, where she was born; but most of all she walked and talked with Mads, Karen, Stine and Marie, or sat with them in the evenings. And while they continued to extend to her the kindest hospitality and most sincere love, they would have no talk about religion. Neither did they know much about their genealogy, except for the tradition that their mother's father's people, the Hvids, were of the nobility -- way back. In the midst of all the jollities, festivals, and genuine happiness of being together with her loved ones and their families, there was a deep well of disappointment in Else's heart as time drew on and she was unable to speak to any of the Gospel. They had heard and believed far too many rumors of Mormons. Would she ever have another chance to teach them the truth? Not likely! Denmark and America were far apart and who among them there knew the length of their years? And then, when the Jutland wind was howling cold and the long snows had begun, there came the inevitable packed bags - the tearful goodbys - a blur of red and white flags flying in the distance, and Else was sailing west again. "Well there goes Denmark - she's a Lovely Land!" But soon she began to look for land the other way; she would keep Christmas in Zion.

That is perhaps where Laurs drove his wagon to meet her and the weary little Ada on their return trip home that mid-December 1890. The towering, snow-capped mountains deepening into varying shades of purple as the day transcended into night. . . . the sky jewelled with the same stars, which here seemed closer somehow. . . the sheltering arms of her husband. . . the welcoming shout of "mother". . . the fond embraces of her happy children; this was her home, her mountain home!

Lundgren-datter-March 1891." As the new decade called the "Gay nineties'' was ushered in, Else K. Christensen picked up her brown kit again and went back to ushering in babies in Gunnison Valley and making entries in her journal. And while she was so busy taking care of the living she found little time to do anything for her dead, even though the words of her blessing must have kept ringing in her ears:--". . . You have come forth here on earth in order to accomplish a great mission, along with your husband, for your father's and mother's lineage, those who are now dead are in prison and wait to be freed by you and your family." Laurs, on the other hand, often went to the Manti
Temple to do work for his dead with Christen and Anne, who were ever faithful in this work. On a number of these occasions he did work for Else's deceased male relatives - her father, grandfathers, uncles, and her dead brother Christen.

Else found herself a new cause to work for early that year - helping to straighten out the political inefficiency and mismanagement in the Territory; for, according to church historian Andrew Jenson, "Under the Liberal Party rule, Salt Lake City became a regular rendezvous for foot pads, burglars and thieves; immorality,<span id="page-332"></span> wickedness and lawlessness had full sway; taxation was made oppressive and unjust." This condition was also true in Ogden and some of the other more populous areas where anti-Mormons were gaining control. The church authorities became alarmed and issued a call for the membership to take an active part in the political activities in Zion. The church-supported Peoples Party was dissolved and its former members advised to affiliate with one or the other of the national parties, Republican or Democrat. Thus on May 20, 1891 the first Utah Republican Party was organized and later nominated their State ticket and the Utah Democrats followed suit, organizing on June 20 and having their nominating convention July 8, 1891. In the territorial election which followed, August 3rd, the Democrats elected twice as many members to each of the two legislative bodies, the Council and the House, as were elected by the Liberal Party. The Republican vote was light. It was not until 1894 that the Republicans began showing more strength in the valleys and the Liberal Party was dissolved.

Utah had enjoyed small political influence in the country up to this point. Her various representatives to the national assemblies, if Mormons, were seldom seated without long drawn-out trials and tribulations. Many of the Saints in the valleys were continually deprived of their voting privileges, especially those who were polygamists. Though the Territory was Democratic as a whole and Salt Lake City Liberal, the nation itself was under Republican rule in 1891; Benjamin Harrison, Republican, having been elected United States President Nov. 6, 1888. This president seemed largely sympathetic with the cause of the Saints and on a number of occasions commuted the unjust sentences of various Utah citizens or pardoned them entirely. On Sat, 9 May 1891, President Harrison visited Salt Lake City and was received with great enthusiasm by the large crowd which gathered from far and near. He was replaced as president of the nation by a Democrat, Grover Cleveland, but before leaving office the forepart of 1893, Harrison issued a Proclamation of amnesty to polygamists for past offenses, but recommended vigorous prosecutions against future infractions of<span id="page-333"></span> the Edmunds law. This act opened the door for
the restoration of property and civil rights to the much beleaguered Saints.

Else K. Christensen joined the party of Lincoln, the Republican, and became one of its staunchest supporters in Gunnison Valley. It was jokingly said of her that "she could spend all day shearing sheep and then go and give stump speeches for the Republican Party half the night" in her enthusiasm for this cause. It has also been stated that from the time she was first given her voting franchise she never failed to cast her vote in an election to which she was entitled, as long as she lived. She valued this privilege highly. Her Danish sisters didn't begin to enjoy the same right until 1915, during the First World War, although naturalized women in Utah had been granted their franchise on 2 Feb. 1870. It was while Else was living in Gunnison that she was sent as a delegate from that district to the Republican State Convention in Salt Lake City, to assist in the selection of the Republican state ticket. One might rightly have called her "Mrs. Republican of Gunnison Valley!" Laurs too was a Republican as long as he lived and as long as the party was in existence in Utah, and was undoubtedly just as staunch in his conservative convictions as Else, but obviously much less outspoken and demonstrative.

The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad finally came to Gunnison Valley the spring of 1891. The first depot was located in west Christenburg on the main road from Mayfield to Gunnison and about two miles from Gunnison proper. As the "iron horse" first came puffing down the track, people were on hand from miles around to witness the great event. Little children screamed, horses
bolted, and men and women wept for joy. A gala celebration followed. By 13 June the train had arrived in Axtell, and by 30 June as far south as Salina, The boom of the railroad building, which had sparked the economy of the area for twenty years, pretty well ceased by the end of that year. A depression began and by 1893 was so severe that wheat, the main medium of exchange, sold for as low as 30&cent; per bushel. Laurs had worked at<span id="page-334"></span> railroading at one time or another, during that
period, and more recently Joseph and Albert had been employed, helping to build the grade between Sterling and Gunnison and saving what they could of their wages in hopes of being able to attend the Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah,

This dream became a reality for them and others of the Christensens, as told in the autobiography of the daughter Elsie:-- "In the fall of 1891 I went to Provo with my brothers Andrew, Joseph and Albert, and Viola Sorensen, to attend the Brigham Young Academy. Sister Capson, Vio's grandmother, kept house for us. The school was held in the Z. C. M. I. warehouse, near the railroad stations. The roar of the trains and the shrieking of the whistles were not conducive to the best school work but this was the best that could be had at the time." Actually, the Academy building had been destroyed by fire on Sunday 27 Jan. 1884 and the upper floor of the warehouse was being used to house the school while a new building was under construction.

Laurs and Else had loaded up their wagon that fall with bedding, clothing, food supplies and cooking utensils - all the necessities to get their four children and the others settled at housekeeping in a place they had located for them about three-and-a-half blocks from the warehouse in Provo.  Then they drove up there by way of Levan and unloaded the supplies at the low adobe dwelling on 4th South and 142 West, the first house east of the millrace where the Christensen youths and their party took up quarters, There were three separate units in the House.  The Christensens and company had two rooms, which must have been a bit crowded for six adults; Esther Ercanbrack and her group from Goshen had two rooms, and the William Ashworth famiy of seven had four rooms.

Following the Christmas holidays the Z. C. M. I. warehouse was bandoned by the students, as Elsie relates:-- "January 4, 1892, the teachers and students, with the band playing, marched to the new building of the B. Y. Academy between 5th and 6th North Academy Avenue (now

<span id="page-335"></span>
University Ave.) On that date the veteran educator, Karl G. Maeser, was released as President of the Academy and Benjamin Cluff was installed as his successor." The Christensens continued to live in the House of Many Doors until the end of that school year however. The old Z. C. M. I. warehouse stood until this winter of 1967/68 and has just now been torn down. The House is still standing, although its adobes have long since been plastered over and painted a pale green. The Christensens called this dwelling the "Knudsen Place" since it was owned by Hans and Birgetta Knudsen when they lived there.

In the spring the wagon came again from Gunnison to take the Christensens and their things back home, and the next fall it brought them back to school again. Roxie Bartholomew and her younger sister Sarah came up from Fayette to attend B. Y. A. and Maren and Lars Myrup's oldest son, Lewis, came up with the Christensens. Though boarding houses changed each year, the method of transportation did not. For the next several years the Christensen wagon went back and forth each spring and fall, often camping on the way, moving the students of the family and their things to and from school at B. Y. A. and more often than not the mother Else would be driving. We have been told that friends in Levan used to watch for that wagon each fall and when sighted would say, "There go the Christensens - the B. Y. A. Can now open its doors!!!" Additional supplies were sent up from home when needed. Some autumns Else came up and stayed in Provo for several weeks in order to get the young people settled. This was true the beginning of school in 1894, when the daughter Emma joined the others at B. Y. A.

This educational opportunity would not have been made possible without the sacrifices and efforts of Laurs and Else, nor would it have been possible without the unselfish assistance of the older son and brother Chris. This should never be forgotten! Though Christian never had the opportunity for much formal education, he was unstinting in the monetary assistance and<span id="page-336"></span> encouragement he gave to his brothers and sisters in an effort to further their educations. In a history of Christian, written by his daughter Pearl, mention is made of this:-- "Christian, being the oldest, had little chance for an education in school.  His mother, having had a good education, taught him so that when he entered school he was ready for the upper grades. He studied very hard when he had the opportunity, and had an excellent memory. Christian worked and saved enough money to help his three brothers and two sisters through school at Provo. I have been told that he saved two hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces to assist in their educations. He visited them at Provo once and paid for having all their pictures taken. When it was time for their graduations he paid for graduation pictures, bought new graduation outfits and attended the exercises, When they all returned home to Gunnison a big dinner was served by their mother in honor of the occasion." Yes, it was largely through the encouragement of their father and their older brother Christian, but perhaps more especially of their mother Else, that six of the nine living Christensen children (all who would take advantage of it) had some college training. Four of them qualified for graduation at B. Y. A. (later B. Y. U.); five became professional teachers, two later graduated from an eastern university, and one studied abroad. In Gunnison Valley they gained the reputation of being a very well educated family - and much of it was "done on a shoe string", so to speak.

It was inevitable that the Christensen youths should marry and leave the nest. Of course their parents were concerned that they select worthy marriage companions. Likely Else counseled each of her sons and daughters, at one time or another, as her mother had counseled her, --"When you choose your life's mate it is the whole future of your own blood that you are choosing!" Albert related an interesting conversation he had with his mother on this subject:-- "I had never permitted myself to think about getting married, as I was primarily interested in obtaining my legal education.<span id="page-337"></span> It was well known to my parents that I had the ambition to become a lawyer. I had occasionally taken out a certain young lady and, as far as I knew, she was suitable in all respects. I presumed my mother knew that I was going out with her. It came to my attention that, in talking to one of the neighbors, mother had incidentally remarked that she hoped that I would not marry this particular person. Shortly thereafter I approached mother and told her that I had something very special that I wished to talk to her about. I asked her to come into her bedroom, and accordingly she accompanied me into the bedroom and I closed the door. A chair was placed for her, and taking a seat directly in front of her I said, 'Mother, I am thinking about getting married'. She seemed stunned - too surprised to speak; and then I added, 'I would like for you to find me a suitable wife'. She threw up her hands and exclaimed, 'That's your business - I'll have nothing to do with it!' I said, 'Well, if that is the way you feel, I will assume the responsibility but I wanted to have it clearly understood between us'. And that ended that and the young lawyer-in-embryo had won his first case.

Joseph was the first to marry. He went to the Manti Temple Wed. 6 Sept. 1893 and Laurs and Else went with him. They must have been delighted with the girl he chose - Roxie, the eldest daughter of Bishop Bartholomew of Fayette. The Bartholomew family had been among the first to settle in Fayette and was considered outstanding in many ways - but particularly in overcoming the wilderness and in devoted service to the Lord. Indeed, Roxie came from fine stock. Her father, John Bartholomew, was Presiding Elder and then Bishop of Fayette for forty-seven years in all. In their new rock house in Fayette he and his capable wife, Eliza Roxie Metcalf, had entertained many of the General Authorities over the years, including church president, Wilford Woodruff, who was a favorite visitor in their home. Two more of the Christensens married into this family, Andrew marrying Roxie's younger sister Sarah, also in the Manti Temple, Wed. 1 July 1896, and Elsie marrying their brother Alma in the same<span id="page-338"></span> temple, Wed, 26 June 1901. As their children came along there were many "double cousins" among the Christensen and Bartholomew descendants. It has been said that Sister Christensen and Sister Bartholomew got their heads together and tried to make a fourth match between their two families but Elvena Christensen and Henry Bartholomew didn't see things their way.

The oldest son Christian was the second of Laurs' and Else's children to marry and it was to his childhood sweetheart, Caroline Larsen, that he was wed. It had always been felt that Chris would marry the daughter of their old Christenburg friends and neighbors, Ole H, and Inger Larsen. They chose to marry at Gunnison during the Christmas holidays, Dec. 29 that winter of 1893, Her parents gave the couple a fine wedding party that Friday at 4 o'clock in their nice winter home in Gunnison, and we can be sure the Christensens were all invited. "The lovely bride wore a beautiful dress of robin-egg blue satin with orange blossoms in her long, blond hair." The newlyweds rented their first home but began building their own house right away. This was less than a block east and across the road south from the home into which Chris had moved with his parents as a small boy, when the Christensens had first come to Gunnison twenty-three years before; for he was now twenty~six while Caroline was twenty-two-and~-a-half. In two years the white rock house was finished and the two moved in, along with their year old daughter Pearl.

As each of the Christensen children were married they could at least expect one of Else's homemade quilts and a pair of her down-filled pillows, Else always kept geese and with the coming of each spring the ritual of plucking their down came too. Though not as hard as shearing sheep, nevertheless this job took a lot of pluck, with the frightened geese honking and almost screaming in pain - though 'tis said it didn't hurt them overly much. Winters found Else stuffing pillows or carding the wool she had sheared from their few sheep in spring and making it into batts to line the quilt tops she had pieced from scraps.<span id="page-339"></span> Then she would get out her quilting frames; she nearly always had a quilt set up winter, spring and summer. Though she seemed to prefer community and church work to sewing and cooking, she did plenty of these and did them well. And oh the hundreds of pairs of black wool stockings she knit!

Christen's and Anne's children were also growing up and getting married. Their oldest and only daughter, Caroline, was wed that same year, Friday, 3rd Nov. 1893, in Gunnison. Later she went to the Manti Temple and was sealed to her husband, John Jensen of Axtell. John was the son of Josiah Sr, and Marie Madsen Jensen, some of the first settlers of Axtell. John and Caroline
settled in Axtell where he had a nice farm and here all their children were born. The first, a girl they named Annie Lillian, born 17 Feb. 1895, later to become Mrs, Sidney Martin Peterson, who has helped so much with this history. She and her brother Alonzo Jensen, born 28 Dec. 1897, are still living. But Caroline had misfortune with her children after that and lost first a girl and then four boys, one after the other, the first four being stillborn and the last only living long enough to draw a breath. All five of these were of course unnamed.

The year 1893 was not only an important one for the Christensens but for the LDS Church as well. At April Conference that year the glorious Salt Lake Temple, which had been under construction for forty years, was dedicated. But the temple had been thought of even before that when on July 28, 1847, four days after the Pioneers first entered Salt Lake Valley (and when Lauritz Mathias Christian Christensen was six days old we might add) President Brigham Young was walking over the barren ground of Salt Lake City with some of his associates, the site had been selected. Wilford Woodruff became President of the Church and as such had the privilege of offering the dedicatory prayer in behalf of the Salt Lake Temple, 6 Apr. 1893. The dedicatory services were repeated almost daily until 24 April, thirty-one meetings in all being held in honor of this great<span id="page-340"></span> event. These were attended by a total of nearly 75,000 people. Were any of our Christensens among them? Very likely. But it seems the Christensen sons and daughters favored the Manti Temple in which to be married for eternity; for, whether by choice or convenience, eight of the nine eventually entered its portals for this sacred ordinance. Only the oldest, Christian, and his wife Caroline had their eternal marriage performed in the great Salt Lake Temple - but that is another story.

This was an important year for Gunnison also for near its close, under the power of the Sanpete County Court at Manti, Gunnison finally became a town (late 1893). Efforts to incorporate had been made in 1878 and again in 1881, but these attempts had not materialized and Gunnison had remained a precinct for thirty-four years. The first town council met in January 1894 and Anthony Madsen was selected as town president. Plans were made to build a new city hall and a school house, ordinances were set up and other town officials appointed. It must have been at this time that Else K. Christensen was chosen as Gunnison town doctor, for although no recorded statement to this effect has yet been found among early Gunnison records, which are at best very incomplete, it has long been known that she served as such when the town was first incorporated. Since her brother-in-law, Anthony Madsen, was then serving as town president it seems logical to conclude that he had some influence in securing Else's appointment at this time. And who else in the Valley was more qualified? How long she served or just what her duties were as such, we have no way of knowing.

Else had discontinued her public practice as midwife the forepart of 1893. The last entries that appear in her medical journal in this regard are the following:-- "Nordfelt - datter - 13 Jan, 1893; Henry Jensen (Mayfield) son 19 Jan, 1893; Chris M. Jensen (Mayfield) son - 22 Jan, 1893; Chris Gravenstien - son - 24 Jan. 1893." In some histories that have been compiled about Else K, Christensen the statement has been made that she<span id="page-341"></span> delivered some 2,000 babies in Gunnison Valley during her public service there as midwife. This is highly erroneous, It is questionable if there were half that many babies born in all, in this Sparcely settled valley, during the thirteen-and-a-half years Else was carrying on her practice. Sometimes numbers have a habit of growing, as babies do. Actually, in her journal Else lists a total of three hundred and twenty-one babies that she delivered from June 1879 to Jan. 1893. We know she delivered others later, including a number of her very own grandchildren, but these are not recorded in her journal.

The last of the nineteenth century was drawing to its close.  Headlines marked the on-moving years - the months - the days:-- "Sat, Jan 4, 1896, President Grover Cleveland signs the proclamation admitting Utah to the Sisterhood of States. . . A
new star, the 45th, is placed in the flag of the United States. . . Great crowds gather in Salt Lake City, and elsewhere in Utah, in jubilant celebrations; Tue. Nov. 3, 1896, William McKinley, Republican from Ohio, is elected President of the
United States in a hard fought election. . . Mar. 4, 1897, Inauguration of Pres. Wm, McKinley celebrated by Republicans in Utah with great fervor; July 24, 1897, Utah celebrates the 50th anniversary of her founding. . .

New State flag seen flying amidst those of the red, white and blue in the largest parade ever seen in western America. . . Great display of fireworks on Utah's Capitol Hill;

Though a specific century may create but a ripple in the main tide of world affairs or leave small mark on the subsequent course yet it is highly important to those whose spans life are cast in that period. We cannot disassociate people from their environments and their environments and their heritage be it physical, political, economic, social or spiritual. The tapestry of man's character is woven of many fibers - his home, family and friends, his associates, his own personality, his religion, the land in which he lives and what goes on in that land. The quality and depths of such influences make up a good part of the fiber which runs deeply and broadly through the cloth of his character and usually determines his individual integrity or turpitude, be that as it may. The stronger and richer the fibers the more durable and beautiful the tapestry.

## AND SHOULD THEY DIE

In Gunnison little Ada grew paler and weaker, but still she smiled from her sick bed as the Christensens made every effort to ease her pain and try to make her happy. She had lived much longer than had been expected, under the strain of an inefficient heart, during which time she had endeared herself to the entire family with her sweetness and patience. At the turn of the new
year, 3 Jan. 1897, the child passed quietly away. She lacked a little less than two months of being nine years old. She was survived by her real father and stepmother, two own sisters and one brother, as well as her foster parents, Laurs and<span id="page-343"></span> Else Christensen, and nine foster brothers and sisters, who mourned her passing in very truth, for she had left a vacant place among them and a sweet memory that could never be replaced. Indeed this gentle little soul had done her best to shed happiness within the home where she had been so lovingly welcomed.

Little Ada was buried on the Madsen plot in the Gunnison Cemetery beside her own mother Sarah and baby sister Almira, and near the grave of a little half sister, Ethelind Florence Madsen, who had died soon after birth six years before. Ada's tombstone bore this inscription:-- "In loving memory of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and Sarah Madsen - Born Mar. 14, 1888 - Died Jan. 3, 1897 - In sore distress your life has past - You loved us all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen."

It is thought that both Laurs and Else were among those who attended the wonderful celebration that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of the first pioneers to Great Salt Lake Valley, 24 July 1847. The year 1897 was an extra special Jubilee Year in Utah. In January plans had been made by the State Legislature to "conduct a celebration that would attract national attention." Gunnison Valley residents joined the crowds, the largest ever seen on Salt Lake City streets, to witness the spectacular events of the five day semi-Centennial celebration - the dedication of the Pioneer Monument surmounted by the bronze statue of Brigham Young - a reception for all surviving pioneers - daily parades and speeches - a carnival and fireworks. On Sunday, 24 July, a memorial was held in the Tabernacle to honor all deceased pioneers. Laurs and Else wore their official "Pioneer Badges" to many Pioneer Day celebrations. These were among their cherished treasures.

But most cherished of all their treasures were of course their children. It is wonderful to have parents who uplift and encourage their children to pursue challenging goals and who support them when they meet the inevitable frustrations and reverses of life. Not all were as fortunate<span id="page-344"></span> as the sons and daughters of Laurs and Else Christensen in this regard. We know of one little girl who was born in far-off Sweden. When she was about three years old her father took his own life and her young mother was forced to return to the shelter of her father's home, taking her little girl with her. A few months later another little girl was born to this unfortunate young mother. The embittered father, though a widower in failing health and needing his daughter's care, seemed to begrudge her little children even the crusts of bread that went into their mouths, making things most miserable for them all. It seemed an answer to this unhappy mother's prayers when she received a small sum of money, coming to her children from their father's mother's estate, their grandmother who had emigrated to Zion and died there. With a prayer for wisdom in her heart, the young mother had taken the precious money and paid the fare for her oldest daughter, then six years old, to go to Zion to the home of some of her father's other relatives there, in fact, his half-brother who lived in Salt Lake City. The little girl was sent in the care of some returning Mormon missionaries in the fall of 1895. The mother had planned that somehow she and her other little girl would join this older daughter in Zion in the near future - but this she was never able to manage. The small Swedish emigrant's half uncle in Salt Lake City was a polygamist, with two wives and two separate families. Times were hard for them and money for the necessities of life was scarce and with many mouths to feed little Anna Theresia Carlson was not too welcome among them - neither did she speak the language. After
a time she was shifted about among various families here and there - Salt Lake City - Schofield - Gunnison - Centerfield - finally winding up, when eight years old, in this latter place in the home of an elderly couple whom she never learned to know
well or feel at home with and who were in no way related to her, as far as she knew. But they sent her to school in Centerfield for the very first time, with her lunch wrapped up in paper - a sandwich of dry bread spread with bacon grease. She was always hungry. So after a few days of school here she ran<span id="page-345"></span> away, or rather wandered away and became lost - and nobody came to find her. A mid-September dusk in 1897 found Theresia in northwest Gunnison, hungry, cold and forlorn. She fell asleep that night on the steps of the Relief Society Hall. The shouts of happy children gathering on the nearby school grounds next morning awakened her. Lonely and disheveled she sauntered over to join them, but the school bell sounded and they rushed into the schoolhouse and she was left alone again, having no desire to follow them in. Nobody seemed to mind her and she hung around the school until morning recess brought the children out again.

She joined a small group of girls, seemingly about her own age of nearly nine. She was a stranger to them and questions flew fast: 'Where do you live?" She said she didn't know - which was probably true. "Where are your father and mother?" She had no
father and her mother was far away. "Don't you have a home?" No, she had no home - no place to go. Among the group was a tender hearted little girl whose last name was Fredrickson. She lived just kitty-cornered northwest from the Relief Society Hall nearby. She took Theresia home with her and told her mother that her new-found friend had no place to go. "Can't she live with us Mother?'! Sister Fredrickson, overburdened with a large family, answered, "We'll see"! and her daughter scampered back to school, leaving the strange little Swedish girl in the hands of her mother.

Sister Fredrickson looked the child over, she was a beautiful girl but so neglected looking. After trying to make her feel at home and listening to her tearful little story, told in halting, broken English, she considered the situation while Theresia ate hungrily of the food she had given her. Then the kind Sister said, "I know just the place for you my dear. Some people down the block have recently buried a little girl about your age. Come along with me!" And so they went west to the end of the block. Sister Fredrickson and Anna Theresia Carlson, whom henceforth we shall call "Tresia", but let her tell part of her own story.

"I was shifted about from one family to another until I didn't have a place to live. A lady knew<span id="page-346"></span>  someone who had just lost a little girl named Ada, so we went to see her. Sister Christensen called her husband in from outside and they talked things over and then said one more mouth wouldn't make any difference with them: so I was taken in. It reads like a book. They were so wonderful to me! There are no words written or spoken that are good enough to describe them. They treated me as their own. If Vena got new shoes - I got new shoes; if Vena got a new dress - I got a new dress. The rest of the family were grand to me too."

So once more the Gospel of the Master came into action in the home of Laurs and Else Christensen of Gunnison, for had it not been said, "Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only. . . dry up the tears. . . comfort the sorrowing. . . ease the pain of the sick. . . share with the hungry and needy. . ." And little Ada's empty bed was filled again and Elvena had a playmate and companion in the home, younger than she by nearly two years, to be sure, yet in the matters of the world, much older and wiser. They went to school together and Tresia took the surname of Christensen as long as she lived with them and attended school there in Gunnison, which was for some six or seven years after that. Today Tresia lives in Maricopa, California and is in her eightieth year, the only one of those living today who once mingled intimately within the confines of this Christensen home.  And how well she remembers those days when first she came to dwell there. Vena was the only one of the family attending school then in Gunnison, except herself as mentioned. Christian was of course married and mostly away with the sheep; Andrew too was married and teaching in Kanab; Joseph also married, was teaching in Centerfield but living in Gunnison; Albert was beginning his first year of law school back in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Elsie was also teaching in Centerfield and driving back and forth; Emma was teaching in Spring City, and seventeen year old Louis and fifteen year old Chris with the various herds, although Papa and Mama, as Tresia always called Laurs and Else, would have much preferred having them in school. And what teases those two younger boys were!<span id="page-347"></span> 

Death struck often in those early days in Gunnison Valley and the Christensens and their loved ones could not always escape the hand of the Grim Reaper. Laurs' youngest sister, Sena, or Nielsene Christiana as she had been christened, had had some misfortune with her children, having lost four out of nine sons sent her over a period of twelve years, three of them one after the other. She had been wed to Anthony Madsen 18 Oct. 1883 some three months after the death of her sister Maren Myrup, when she was twenty-one and Anthony, who also came from Kobberod, Jutland where she was born, was twenty-three. Sena's tenth son was born 21 July 1898 but died the same day before he could be given a name. Sena herself, youngest child of Christen and the gentle Karen, followed this last of her little ones in death the next day, 22 July 1898, which was the fifty-first birthday of her brother Laurs. She was thirty-six. Mother and babe were buried in the same casket in the Gunnison cemetery. Anthony Madsen married again in less than five months, for he was sorely in need of a woman's help with the five surviving sons, the oldest nearing fourteen. He was wed to a Danish girl, Nielsena Necolena Dortary Nielsen, or "Lena". The ceremony took place in the Manti Temple 14 Dec, 1898. On this same occasion the necessary work was done for the departed Sena and she and Anthony, with all their sons both living and dead, were sealed together as a family for eternity - and Lena stood for Sena. Lena herself gave Anthony two sons and two daughters but only one of each kind lived to present him with grandchildren.

There are times of exaggerated sadness accompanying death.  Who can say whose passing is most mourned, that of a much loved child, a young so-much-needed mother, or one of the "Old Ones" who goes to the grave trailing his accumumulated years of struggle, courage and overcoming behind him? Christen Christensen passed away Tues 21 Nov. 1899 in his eighty-third year, going down like a fine hewn log, an honest man well seasoned with experience and great faith. He wasn't sick very long; pneumonia took him. He seemed to know he was going and 'tis said that in<span id="page-348"></span> his last hour he insisted on Anne straightening and smoothing down his clothing all around him, wishing to be as immaculate in death as he had always tried to be in life.  If, as some Danes believed, there was a gathering of all one's dead ancestors over the earth at an Old One's passing, then there must have been a great unseen host of both relatives and friends waiting to greet Christen Christensen from Thy, when he died. He had done so much for the living over the years, and he had done so much for the dead, laboring consistently in the temple not only for his relatives but for great numbers of his deceased friends as well.

This was an honorable man and his word had been as good as his bond.  Not only had he served and loved man, both the living and the dead, but he had loved animals too, especially fine horses.  He had reared many thoroughbreds in his day and was always kind to the dumb beasts.  We have been told that he was very particular about housing and feeding his animals, never going to bed at nights until he was sure they were all right and had plenty to eat.  Their stables and mangers were cleaned every day.  He studied about animals and numbers of people brought their ailing livestock to him to be treated.  We like to think of Christen Christensen as somewhat of a thoroughbred himself; for, though homespun, he was a fine and noble gentleman in every way - and from the ancient Danish Vikings in a straight line.  But there was little fanfare when they laid him away in Gunnison - no bell tolled for him. Red flags of warning were on many gateposts there for the whole town was under quarantine for smallpox. No inside congregating was allowed so the funeral itself was held outside in front of the home in the bleak day-dark of Sat. Nov. 25, 1899.

Christen was survived by Anne and five of her six children, three of Karen's children including the eldest son Christen in Denmark, numerous grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.  One of his grandchildren, Andrew, son of Laurs and Else, was then attending school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One night he saw his grandfather Christensen, dressed as for travel and with a valise in

his hand, come walking through the door and up to the bed where he was sleeping. The surprised Andrew asked, "Where are you going?" His grandfather Christen replied, "I am going to Denmark to hunt my genealogy", and then he disappeared. A few days later Andrew was informed of the death of his grandfather, 21 Nov. 1899, the same night the old gentleman had visited him in a dream or vision.

For some years Anne continued to live in the old home, together with her son Joseph who never married. She was a humble woman of great faith and always thanked her Heavenly Father every day, even for the small things of life such as a good bed to sleep in. She had been very good to Christen and Christen had been kind to her. They had spent some thirty-three years together, sharing the hardships and sorrows as well as the joys of life, among the latter of which could be counted their labors together in the beautiful Manti Temple. Christen had been able to raise money to bring Anne's sister, Mary Jensen, over from Denmark and get her established in Zion, which was also a great joy to Anne. During her later years she sold the old home and she and Joseph moved closer into town. It was to this new location that Anne's daughter, Caroline C. Jensen, came often
from Axtell to care for her mother in her last days, for she suffered greatly at the end and passed away 3 Apr. 1914 of what was thought to be cancer. A monument of some consequence, as Gunnison tombstones go, marks the place where Christen Christensen is buried, along with his wife Anne and two of their sons, in the Gunnison cemetery.

As the grandsons of Christen Christensen grew to manhood in Gunnison, there began to be some confusion among those who carried the Christensen surname and also bore the same given names as other Christensens in that small community. Laurs and Else had a Christian, Andrew and Joseph; Christen and Anne had a Christen, Andrew and Joseph, and there were other Christensen families there at the same time in a similar fix, These same-named individuals were always getting their identities<span id="page-350"></span> and mail mixed up, to say the least. Finally the sons of Laurs and Else decided to do something about it and most of them assumed middle initials and changed the spelling of their surname from Christensen to Christenson; to the latter of which generations of their Christensen progenitors must have looked askance. But no matter, from this, Christian "I", Andrew "B", Joseph "C", Albert "H" and Louis "D" Christenson emerged. Not to be wholly outdone, some of their half-uncles also adopted middle initials but left their surname spelling intact. Thus there were now Christen "K", or Chris Krat as he came to be called, Andrew "E" and Joseph "Y" Christensen. These name changes were never legalized except through long usage and some of the Christensons eventually went back to the original Danish spelling of Christensen. The spelling of this surname has since been used interchangeably among the various descendants of their common progenitor, Christen Christensen from Thy.

Albert H. Christenson, now a full fledged young lawyer, married Ellen Virginia Snow, whom he called "Jennie", in the Manti Temple Wed. 26 Sept. 1900. She was the granddaughter of Col. Warren Stone Snow of Black Hawk War fame. Tresia remembers that Laurs and Else drove up to Manti in a two-seated rig to attend the wedding reception that night at the Snow home, taking Elvena and herself with them. Both of the girls had new shoes for the occasion, As was the custom in those days, a fine wedding supper was held at the home. Tresia especially remembers the small glasses of Dixie wine that stood at every place on the long table. At the end of the meal, when the adults had left the table and moved to the parlor, she and some of the other children, including Elvena and Jennie's young twin brothers Joe and Ed, who had been given no wine, proceeded to drink up the wine that was untouched. Tresia must have gotten more than her share for the last she remembers she was being lugged upstairs by the bride's stepmother, Aunt Lydia, and put to bed for the remainder of the evening. These were the<span id="page-351"></span> remembrances of an eleven year old. But those of the twenty-two year old bride were quite different, as Jennie Christensen recalled it thus:--"How my mind will travel back to our wedding night. We, Albert and I, had sewn autumn leaves on the curtains in the afternoon for decorations. That night it was chilly and raining hard, but I hardly noticed it, so bright did it seem inside. We had fires in the grates. We came downstairs, A. and I, and went into the parlor which was filled with guests. What an array of flowers was about the rooms. I remember I was so proud of him!"

Louis D. was married to Sarah Florence Mellor of Fayette, 6 Mar. 1901, in the Manti Temple. Her people had also been among the
first settlers in Fayette. But her mother was dead and her father, a polygamist, lived with his other family, while Florence pretty much had to look after her younger brothers and sisters as best she could. Tresia remembers that Florence and her sister made her wedding dress out of white "china silk" which she saved and later used the material to make a christening robe for her first child and daughter LaFaun. The Christensens gave the couple a wedding celebration and dinner at their home in Gunnison. Not long afterwards Louis left on a mission for the Church to the Western States Mission in Colorado (June 1901) but he was not there very long before he was called back home because of the desperate illness of his bride.

Elsie was married soon after Louis left for his mission. This is as she recorded the event in her own history:-- "On 26 June 1901 I was married to Alma C. Bartholomew of Fayette, Sanpete Co., Utah, in the Manti Temple by John D. T. McAllister, then temple president. After the ceremony, since we had been invited by my brother Albert and his wife to come to their home for dinner after we were through, we went down to their house on Second West, but found no one home. However, the door was unlocked and a large bowl of lovely fresh fruit centered the table, to which we helped ourselves. My parents gave us a very elaborate wedding reception in their home that same evening.<span id="page-352"></span> There were one hundred invited guests, including four Bishops." Elsie was twenty-six years old at the time and Alma was not yet twenty-three, for there were three and a half years difference in their ages.

At the beginning of this new century there were prosperous times in the United States. President William McKinley had successfully steered the Ship of State through the turbulent waters of the Spanish American War which had been largely brought about by Spain's shameful treatment of her colony, Cuba. So many Cubans died a terrible death from starvation, Uncle Sam stepped in and told the Spaniards that they could not continue their heartless oppression of these people and sent the battle ship Maine into Cuban waters to back up the statement if necessary. The Spaniards more or less thumbed their noses at the U. S. A, by blowing up the Maine. McKinley declared the Cubans to be free and independent and went to war to enforce it. Spain had part of the Philippines in her possession too, and the Filipinos were also fighting for their independence at this time. The U. S. A. sent a fleet into Manila Bay to assist in the protection of the rights of the struggling people of the Philippines and in the fight which followed, destroyed the Spanish Armada there. In a few months the Spanish American War was over, and under the terms of peace Cuba was given her freedom and Spain sold the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and another of their small islands to the United States for $20,000,000. During the war Hawaii requested protection and was also annexed to the United States.

The successful outcome of the war and the prosperity of the country resulted in President William McKinley being elected to another term of office at the general election held Tue. 6 Nov. 1900. The Republican ticket in Utah also won by a large majority. Less than a year after the beginning of his second term of office, or on Fri. 6 Sept. 1901, the President was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. A man by the name of Leon F. Czolgass joined a receiving line where McKinley was shaking hands with people.<span id="page-353"></span> Raising his apparently injured right hand, wrapped in a large white handkerchief, as if to shake the hand of the President, Czolgass fired two bullets into him with the concealed gun he held and, as William McKinley fell, said with satisfaction: "I have done my duty." As soldiers and spectators rushed to the assassin, the mortally wounded McKinley cried out, "Be easy with him boys." When questioned, the anarchist stubbornly maintained that he was convinced it was a good thing for the country to have killed the president. Czolgass was electrocuted.

All of the nine children of Laurs and Else were of course living at the time of President William McKinley's assassination. Eight of their grandchildren were alive at the time of McKinley's death - Chris and Caroline had daughters Pearl and Elora and sons Elmer and LeRoy; Andrew and Sarah had a son Adelbert and a daughter Edith (later Edythe); Joseph and Roxie had a son Harold, but had lost three little babies straight in a row after that; while strange as it may seem, Albert and Jennie had their first child, a daughter Virginia, on the very day President McKinley was shot. All of the nine Christensen sons and daughters were sventually given away in marriage. And though this giving may have seemed a sacrifice to Laurs and Else at the time, it proved to be a blessing like "bread cast upon the waters", returning to them after many days numerous grandchildren to honor and cherish their names.

Pearl remembers when Joseph and Roxie moved into their new home in Gunnison. They had a big house-warming and the place looked beautiful for the occasion, especially inside. The parlor walls were blue and rope had been gilded and tacked around near the ceiling to form a border, the color scheme being blue and gold. Joseph was then in the bishopric in Gunnison Ward and also teaching school there. Roxie was expecting her fifth baby and hungry for one, since Harold was almost eight.

October came, and Joseph went to Salt Lake City to attend General Conference and also to be present at U. E. A. which was to be held afterwards. He left his mother in charge of Roxie who was looking for a new baby any day. Else had delivered several of her grandchildren before this, along with hundreds of other babies, but as far as she knew, no one could put more strength into childbirth than her daughter-in-law Roxie. What pains. . . . what hours and hours of hard labor. . . how many trips walking around the block, with help from brothers, father or husband. . . what agony preceded every birth. It would take six weeks after for Roxie to get her strength back. Little of course was known then of modern medicine and the treatment was crude and even rough, but it was all they knew. It didn't help much either for expectant mothers to be urged to "eat for two" and to be passed seconds at every meal.

This fifth baby was overdue. Finally, on Tue. 7 Oct. 1902, the little girl came, but she had been too long in the birth and was limp and blue and wouldn't cry. Else took the little one in her arms and, using all her remedies and skills, putting her first in warm and then cold baths, worked against time to save the baby. And as she worked she prayed aloud the whole time - 'Father please save the life of this child. . . her two little sisters and one brother are dead. . . please save her. . . Roxie and Joseph need this little child. . . please let her live!" For two hours she worked,<span id="page-355"></span> and cried to the Lord to save little Ruth Ellen, or "Root" as she always called her after. She paid little attention to her daughter-in-law during that time, except to report to her at intervals - "A little moisture on the eyelids. . . A little color in the upper lip. . ."

When it was finally safe for the child to be left alone, Else put her down in the place that had been prepared for her and then took care of the mother, Roxie. When all was at last in order, she sat down and wrote her report to her son Joseph, addressing the letter just "Bishop Joseph Christensen, Salt Lake City, Utah." Another Bishop Joseph Christensen of Salt Lake City, who had been born in Gunnison, where his mother still lived, received Else's letter. This Brother had no idea his wife was even expecting and it almost caused complications in his home. Years and years later, Ruth chatted with this other Joseph Christensen while he was on a church assignment in San Diego, California, and he still got a chuckle out of that experience. To the ever-thoughtful Else K, this had seemed the proper thing to do on that occasion. She said she often did things she had never thought of doing before, through inspiration, and more often than not things turned out all right. She usually heeded the whisperings of the "still small voice" that came to her so frequently. She was a woman of great faith - and she had such faith in prayer! She had prayed over hundreds of babies and their mothers in the delivery rooms of Gunnison Valley, as she had also worked and prayed over hundreds of others of her patients. But she had also wept as well - wept over some who had passed away.

## THROUGH YESTERDAY'S WINDOWS

> We live in the past through knowledge of its history, and in the future through hope and anticipation. By ascending to an association with our ancestors, by contemplating their examples and studying their characters; by partaking of their sentiments and imbibing their spirit; by accompanying them in their toils; by sympathizing<span id="page-356"></span> 
in their successes and triumphs, we mingle our existence with theirs, and seem to belong to their age. 

> --Daniel Webster

So many have participated in remembering. In her memoirs Aunt Elsie tells of her father:-- "While father could not do heavy work in his later years, he did his share in caring for the home whenever mother was away. He held many positions of trust in early day Gunnison. After the railroad came to the valley he was freight collector for a number of the mercantile establishments, including the co-op store where he was also watchman for many years. He also hauled freight to Manti and other areas. He was a school trustee for years too. He eventually held the office of High Priest in the church, being ordained to this office on 7 Aug. 1904, and in the early part of the twentieth century was called to receive a special blessing in the Manti Temple because of his faithfulness in his calling in the priesthood. Our home was a happy and congenial one and father was especially kind. He never lost his temper. Both father and mother were devout people, busy raising and providing for their large family but always giving help to neighbors or wherever help was needed, practicing honesty in their dealings with man and God."

Tresia remembers how grandfather used to run races with the children and walk on his hands to entertain them. Some of his grandchildren recall how he used to perch them on his foot or knee and bounce them up and down in ride-a-cock-horse fashion to the rhythm of a Danish rhyme he chanted, "Ride, ride ranke - hesten hedder Blanke - f&oslash;llet hedder Abilgraa - og den skal lille Harold ride paa" and then he'd toss the rider high with much merry laughter; and whether it was Harold, Elmer, Roy, A. Owen, Lucien, Wendell, Byron, or one of the little girls who rode, each always clamored for more. Sometimes he pulled in fun at the children's fingers, one by one, as he tried to teach them the Danish names for each - Tommel-tot, Slikkepot, Langemand, Guldbrand and Lille Peder Spillemand. Yes, grandpa Laurs always<span id="page-357"></span>
seemed to have time for the children.

Tresia remembers that after she gave up her public medical practice, grandmother Else took boarders. The builders who put up the first brick homes in Gunnison were among them. Tresia says, "Your grandmother could cook if she needed to, but she liked community service and church work better. She was always very active in the Relief Society. She kept her own garden, which grandfather ploughed and helped plant, and she took care of the chickens and geese. Each spring she plucked the geese to fill her pillows and each newly married couple in the family got a pair of those pillows for their wedding. She spent her egg money with care. Each fall after threshing she put new fresh straw in the bed-ticks and under the rugs as well. She had a large loom and wove rugs and carpets and was a great quilter, though she wasn't much for fine sewing. Piecing, tying or quilting quilts and tearing and sewing rag rugs was a never-ending process with her. Your grandfather raised the sheep and she helped shear them (she could shear a sheep as good as any man), washed and carded the wool and made it into batts for the quilts or spun it into yarn and dyed it for stockings, of which she made legions. How I hated to wear those black, itchy stockings!"

Tresia also remembers that Aunt Roxie did all of grandmother's sewing for years, after she and Joseph were married. She made all of grandmother's dresses then and those for Vena and Tresia. There was always a new dress for the girls for Christmas. She remembers that Millie Gledhill from down the street worked for grandma when she took boarders, and Bell Wasden from across the road did too. Tresia recalls how grandmother used to like to have her hair combed by Elsie, Emma, Vena or Tresia. During some of her few idle moments she would fall to sleep and nap in her chair while one or the other of them combed or brushed her long hair. It was such a beautiful head of waist-length auburn hair, slightly streaked with grey then, and she wore it in heavy braids wrapped into a bob on top of her head, pinned up with large hairpins and amber<span id="page-358"></span> 
colored hair combs.

Tresia remembers what "cut-ups" Louis and Arthur were, but especially Lou, who at times seemed to be full of the "Old Nick" himself. Tresia was mostly on to their tricks but the trusting Vena, ever free from guile, often bore the brunt of their mischief. Like the time the two boys had, for some misdeed, received their usual punishment of being sent to bed without their supper. This is related by Elaine, as told to her by Aunt Vena:-- "The boys induced Vena to dress up like a 'poor child' and go to their mother with a story about a family of starving children watched over by a sick widow - the lines were well rehearsed beforehand - 'and could you, dear Sister Christensen, please spare a little bread and milk for them?' Else, the soul of charity, fixed up a tasty supper which was to have been duly taken up the back stairs to the waiting brothers. But then Vena giggled and her mother, seeing the whole thing in a nut shell, brought her hand down with a spat on Vena's back part and she was hustled off to bed in disgrace for contributing to the delinquency of her older brothers.

Elaine remembers other things Aunt Vena told her:-- "There was the time her 'dear brothers' put her down the well where she was supposed to hide for a game and then went off and forgot to bring her back up. And there was the time when Lou and Arthur induced her to lie in the ditch (in place of the bridge) and scare grandmother when she came up to the corral at evening to feed swill to the pigs. Else came with a full bucket in each hand, as scheduled but unforeseen by Vena, and before the girl could yell out to scare her stepped right on her stomach, which threw them both into a fright and upset the buckets, drenching Vena in watery garbage. Then there was the time when Vena had saved up eggs enough to buy a coveted blouse. Carrying the eggs in a basket and accompanied by grandmother, she went carefully up the weed-bordered sidewalk toward town. As they came to a wooden bridge spanning an irrigation ditch, they stepped simultaneously on a loose board. Vena, who weighed less than grandmother, flew into the air and landed on, in and under the<span id="page-359"></span> 
ill-fated eggs."

Ruth Ellen remembers her mother Roxie telling about the good soup grandmother Else used to make. "She would cook up a big pot of it - a soup bone, plenty of vegetables and spices and Danish dumplings. About the time the family was ready to sit down to eat, grandmother would remember that 'Old Sister Hansen would like a taste of this soup' and dispatch Louis or Arthur to Sister Hansen's with some in a small lard bucket. Then she'd recall that 'Brother Nielsen might like some nice hot soup' and she'd send the other boy off in the direction of Brother Nielson's with another small pail of soup. By the time the large family sat down for soup there was hardly enough left to satisfy the hearty appetites. Truly grandmother was the soul of generosity."

Tresia remembers when the tall, dark and handsome Swede, Charles Peter Peterson, came courting the dark-haired, rosy-cheeked Emma. He came in a smart one-seated rig and brought her box after box of chocolates which she passed around and then put carefully away in her bureau drawer. Like little mice, Tresia and Vena would stealthily help themselves to the bonbons, one after another; but if Emma knew, she was too sweet and too much in love to lose her temper about it. Charles drove Emma to the Manti Temple in that selfsame rig, Wed. 30 Sept. 1903, to be married. That evening her parents entertained family, neighbors and friends at a wedding supper at their home in Gunnison. Emma was twenty-six then and Charles was twenty-five, but once every year he caught up with her for one month and two days during June and July. Charles had a house all ready for his bride on property he owned one mile east of Gunnison. They called the place the "Bar Double C Ranch".

Millie Gledhill's younger sister, Mary G. Dowdle, remembers that the Gledhill and the Christensen girls were playmates in the early days, and always the best of friends. How the neighbor children loved to go to Grandma Christensen's. She always had some little treat for them - cookies, buns or Danish pastries of some<span id="page-360"></span> 
sort. When older the two youngest Gledhill girls, Mary and Sylvia, did a lot of singing together and were considered very good for that time. They sang "Alexander's Ragtime Band" and "Whispering Hope" in that part of the country for the first time they were sung there. Millie also did some public entertaining with them on occasions. At one time Vena Christensen was "Goddess of Liberty" at one of those wonderful small town Fourth of July celebrations they used to have down there.

Millie's younger brother Albert (Bert) Gledhill, whose mother died when he was in his teens, writes of "Grandpa and Grandma" Christensen:-- "I say Grandpa and Grandma because they were to me just that - and the only ones I ever knew. Enough could never be said about the good they did. Anyone who needed could always get a good meal and bed from them. They helped me in many ways. May I remind you that Grandma was the only medical help we had in Gunnison for a long time, and how well I do remember that she ran a spoon down my throat every other day all one winter. Grandpa and Grandma Christensen gave me, as they did many others, a home when I had no place else to go. May God bless the memory of those two wonderful people is a prayer in my heart - and right now a tear in my eye.

"During the early days in Gunnison Grandpa and Grandma kept a boardinghouse and my sister Millie worked for Grandma, helping with the housework and cooking. Of course this brought Arthur Marinus Christensen and Millie Jane Gledhill together in courtship." Indeed, the two were courting even while Arthur was attending school at Brigham Young Academy in Provo, for love
will find a way! A letter written by Arthur to Millie, who was visiting her aunt in Santaquin, Utah, near Provo at the time, indicates this fact:--
Feb, 17, 1902
My Dear Millie:

Your kind and welcome letter of the 13th was received, and I can assure you that it was read with pleasure. I just came from meeting. They dedicated the new building today (Training School),<span id="page-361"></span> 
The President of the Church, Joseph F. Smith, and a number ofthe Apostles were down. There is going to be a Grand Ball tonight but I do not think I will go as I am so weak it is hard for me to get around. Sorensons have it that I have the diphtheria down here and that I got it from you. I dare not go up to Cornelias (Sorenson) anymore as I might give them the diphtheria (ha ha). Edmund Sanders is down here, he said that nearly all the flags are taken down in Gunnison. (Quarantine flags for diphtheria.) It looks like storm here now - makes me feel quite lonesome for I'm all alone.

"Well dear, I guess if you cannot speak above a whisper you cannot talk to me from where you are. You must write soon and let me know when you are going home. You must not think that it was staying up late that made me sick, for I think it is the warm weather. Did you have a good time at the dance? I did not say I was out until morning Saturday night. Did I not say Friday night? And that was the night I was down to Broadbent's with you. You know I got lost there by the grove and then got stuck in the mud and had to wait until it was light before I could get out. Louis bought John Wasden's place so I guess he will be my neighbor now. I am going to stay here until Saturday or Sunday and if I am not better by that time I will board the train for home.

"Katie went home Saturday for the wedding of Bell and Erick - I suppose you know Otto and Jennette are married. Wish I was in Santaquin - would make your Aunt Lizzie, as you call her, wait a long time if she was going to wait up for you. Well dearest, write soon and then the next time I write you I will know for sure when I am going home. From your own true, Arthur, 333
East 5th North St. Provo, Utah. (Old David Jones home.)" Then Arthur added a hand drawn sketch of a bird flying with a heart in its mouth, on which he wrote the words "Love to Millie."

Millie's and Arthur's courtship led to marriage, Millie's sister remembers this:-- "When Arthur and Millie were married they went to the Manti Temple, Wed. 3 Feb. 1904. Millie<span id="page-362"></span> 
turned twenty-two twenty-three days later. She was nearly five months older than Arthur. A wedding reception was held that night at our home and, as was the custom, a big dinner was served to all the guests. The couple first lived in a small house two doors east of Grandpa and Grandma Christensen's but, when mother died not too much later, they moved west into our home so that Millie could help care for father and us younger Gledhill children."

* * * * *

Grandmother Christensen often had her own troubles. Tresia remembers that at one time she and grandfather had gone to a show at the Opera House there in Gunnison. Upon returning home in the dark, by the Co-op store, she ran into a tie post and cut her forehead and a bad infection set in, which they called Erysipelas. This was an acute infectious disease of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by some kind of streptococcus and was accompanied by inflamation and fever. Grandmother had quite a time of it. At another period she was afflicted with some sort of stomach trouble and couldn't stand to drink either water or milk, nor could she digest her food without much distress and pain. She lived for months eating nothing much but clabbered milk, or "thick milk" as she called it. At another time she injured her foot so that she could not bear her weight upon it. But she kept right on working around the house, moving back and forth kneeling with one leg on a chair. It seems she seldom gave in to pain or self pity, though she was the soul of pity for others who suffered.

Greater pain is usually caused by seeing ones own children or loved ones suffer or by seeing them indulge themselves in practices that are harmful or degrading to them. When children are young, a mother can say "no" to them and it can mean the same as her saying "I love you", for they must be taught self-discipline and of course child-hood is the place to begin this training. As children grow older, parents can seldom teach or govern them by saying "no!" But life is like a mirror and children grow to adulthood with the lessons of their<span id="page-363"></span> 
childhood reflected in their adult lives. I never remember seeing any of my Christensen uncles or my father smoking, nor did my grandfather Christensen use the harmful and obnoxious weed. Of course the gentler sex never smoked in those days, as far as I know. But most of the boys must have tried it at one time or another for that seemed to be the thing to do. In Albert's recollections he tells of his "try":-- "Some of my group - I cannot remember their names - were trying to imitate the older boys they knew who smoked. I somehow thought I would try this experiment so I bought a sack of Bull Durham and a package of cigarette paper and proceeded home with the intention of learning the art. Somehow I didn't even think of hiding it from my mother, who was working about the house and yard. I did remember that she had said in my hearing that she hoped her boys would never be seen with a cigar in their mouths. Well, when I was in the act of rolling my first cigarette my mother came along and observed what I was about to do. The look on her face was so sad that it startled me. She said, "Albert, are you going to smoke?" Tears came to her eyes and she turned away. The look on her face struck me with shocking force. I took the Durham and the paper and threw them into the irrigation ditch. Mother never mentioned the subject thereafter but I never thought of smoking again."

Pearl remembers her father Chris telling about his experience with smoking:-- "Being out with the sheep so much he had taken up the habit of smoking. One day he ran out of smokes and the craving for one became so intense he could hardly bear it. He was alone in the mountains far from any other place or sheep-camp and could not leave his own herd. He said he felt he would go mad if he couldn't have a smoke. Then he thought of the dying campfire - perhaps he could find the unused butt of one in that! Quickly he knelt down by the heap of ashes and began pawing frantically through them in search of a cigarette butt. All of a sudden, in his mind's eye, he stood up and viewed himself as he crouched there groveling around in the ashes and soot like a wild animal. Utterly ashamed, he got up from his knees and vowed then and there<span id="page-364"></span> 
that from that time forward he would never again be a slave and stoop to such a filthy habit. And he never smoked again."

There was often music at the Christensens. Elsie and Emma had each taken some musical instruction at Snow College and again at B. Y. A. Laurs had bought a piano for the home, and both the older girls played it quite well, especially Elsie. Vena also taught herself to play a little. Louis and Arthur learned to chord on the piano and the banjo. Both of them also had good voices, as the older girls did, but especially Lou. Tresia remembers when the two boys sang in the ward choir together there in Gunnison. Pearl remembers that her father often sang at his work and what a very good voice he had, though it was untrained. Grandma Else usually sang or hummed at her work, her rich contralto softly keeping time with her beating or stirring, as she moved from table to stove in the process of her cooking, or with the movement of her body as she scrubbed the dirty clothes up and down on the washboard. Always she hummed at her weaving and quilting, sewing and knitting. Often she sang in Danish what must have been "King Christian" or "There is a Lovely Land". But she sang hymns too in her own special English. I can still hear in memory one of her favorites, as she used to sing and hum it intermittently:-- "Guide us Oh Thou Great Jehovah. . .Guide us to the Promised Land. . . We are weak but thou art able, hold us with thy powerful hand. . . When the earth begins to tremble, bid our fearful thoughts be still. . . When thy judgment spreads destruction, keep us safe on Zions hill. . . Holy Spirit. . . feed us till the Savior comes. . . Great Redeemer. . . Bring, O bring, the welcome day." Grandmother used V's for W's, T's for D's, D's for T's and Y's for J's in her own special brand of English - and how I loved to hear her sing or speak as she did with such fervor.  Grandfather appreciated music too, but I think he loved to dance to it more than sing. In truth, all the Christensens enjoyed music. President David O. McKay once referred to good music as a power that "gentles the human animal". Might we not call it the rainbow that bridges earth with heaven?<span id="page-365"></span> 
It was perhaps in midsummer of 1904 that the son Andrew left for more advanced study in Europe. Laurs and Else must have been extremely excited about this for he planned to visit their relatives in Denmark first, before going to enroll for classes in Germany. Else in particular must have loaded him down with the addresses of her people and "many loving greetings" to give them, as well as plenty of advice about the necessity of gathering as much genealogical information as possible while he visited in Jutland. He was, of course, urged to call on his father's brother Christen and his two daughters, his wife now being dead. But in all instances he must have been cautioned not to mention the Gospel in an outright manner lest he offend his Lutheran relatives and wear out his welcome oversoon. Andrew B. arrived in Jutland, Denmark as scheduled and was welcomed with much warmth by his Danish kin, especially Else's people with whom he spent a number of happy days. They were much impressed with their nephew and cousin "Anders", as they cailed him, if the reports in their letters back to Laurs and Else were any indication. But Andrew's advanced study in Germany that followed did not fare as well, for it was unexpectedly interrupted.

Andrew had left Sarah and the three children, seven-and-a-half year old Adelbert, four year old Edith and one year old Wendell, comfortably situated in a rented home in Prove, Utah. Edith tells of this in her own history:-- "Mother was living in Provo, Utah. Two of her younger sisters, Mary and Rose Bartholomew, were staying with us while attending B. Y. U. Father had returned to Europe for further study. In late November, 1904, snow covered the ground and it was cold. Adelbert fell ill with diphtheria and was isolated. I soon succumbed to the same disease but was given the anti-toxin which helped turn the tide in my favor. When I began to recover I asked to see my brother Adelbert. He was my dearest playmate and, being about three-and-a-half years older, was also something of a champion and defender to me. They toid me that Adelbert had been taken away. No, he would not be back. He died 29 Nov. 1904 and was buried in the Provo cemetery. Grief and<span id="page-366"></span> 
the feeling of utter loss can come to a four year old. I felt bereft and sobered. I had loved this older brother with all the tanacity of my little soul. The feeling lasted for years. Father, of course, broke off his studies and returned from Europe immediately following the news of Adelbert's passing. He came home to comfort his saddened family."

Electricity hadn't come to Gunnison by June 1907, which was the time Elsie and Alma moved from Fayette into the beautiful new red brick house there that they had purchased from the sheepman, Lafe Bown. Most everyone used the common coal-oil or kerosene lamps for lighting and there seldom seemed enough to supply each room. There was a need then for the large center table upon which stood the parlor lamp, filled with coal-oil, its chimney freshly cleaned, sending out a glow of light round which family members flocked at nights, like moths to a flame. If lamps were scarce they were carried from room to room as needed, like the times when President Wilford Woodruff used to visit Bishop Bartholomew's home in Fayette, when the children were small, as told by Mrs. Henry Bartholomew as she heard it from Roxie:-- "President Wilford Woodruff was a favorite visitor at our home, especially with the children. Company always slept upstairs where, if the weather demanded, a nice fire would be built in a little iron stove. But there were never lamps enough to go around to allow the visitor to keep one in his or her room all night. When President Woodruff was there and had retired upstairs to his room with one of the few lamps, the children would wait and listen until they heard him start to snore, then they would say to the Bishop, 'Father, now you can go up and get the lamp.' Then father would be very cautious as he approached the stairs and when a big snore would come he would jump back, saying, 'Do you think there is a bear upstairs?' And how the children would laugh - 'Do it again,' they'd coax." Incandescent lamps fed by gas were acquired by some homes and business places throughout Gunnison Valley however. Such lamps with glass chandeliers were in each of the seven rooms of the James Bown home in Gunnison when that family moved into<span id="page-367"></span> 
it in Sept. 1900. Quite likely Elsie's and Alma's new red brick home also had such ones when they moved in. Gas lamps, at five or six intersections along Gunnison Main Street, were lowered each evening and lit with a torch by the town marshal. He was usually accompanied by a group of children. Early each morning the gas lights were extinguished. The lamplighting era wasn't really over in Gunnison until about 1912.

Who of us can remember the old black kitchen stoves with their long stovepipes, that had to be "blacked" and polished every so often with stove blacking or soot-black, and who can remember the stove brushes, stove lifters, stove lids, stove irons, stove shakers and stove pokers that went along with them? I dare say few of us have ever had to empty ashes from the ashboxes into the ashcans or onto the ash piles that cluttered up the back dooryard of every dwelling. Few of us have been required to remove the clinkers from the stove grates with the stove tongs or carry a stove shovel full of hot coals from a hot to a cold stove to start a fire when matches were scarce, much less to borrow coals from the neighbors. Does anyone now remember the black old stove rag chucked behind every kitchen stove, the coal skuttle and woodbox sitting beside that always seemed to need filling, and the hot water reservoir on the further side of the best kitchen stoves which always seemed to need refilling too? Who recalls the let-down oven doors which all clamored to "sit on first" to warm themselves on cold mornings when their teeth were chattering, and the cozy places behind by the chimneys that were always shared by the cats? Have all now forgotten when the bottoms of all cooking pots and kettles were soot-black and had to be scoured clean with every washing, and when dish rags and dish towels never quite came clean of black even with two sudsings and as many boilings? Likely there are few indeed who can remember the "smoking stoves" that sent all coughing to the open doors for fresh air and which blackened curtains and walls, or the "belching stoves" that threw soot and ashes all over everything. But some can. Yes, those were "the good old days!"<span id="page-368"></span> 
A family reunion was planned in honor of grandfather Laurs' sixtieth birthday, which was July 22, 1907. All of his living descendants gathered at the old home in Gunnison for that occasion and those from out of town stayed over for July 24th as well. Most of the children, with their families, lived nearby: Chris and Caroline and their four girls and two boys were just a few blocks away; Joseph and Roxie with their two boys and one girl were a bit closer; Elsie and Alma with their four boys were settled in their new home, which was also within a few blocks of Laurs' and Else's; Emma and Charles came from their ranch a mile east of town with one child of each kind - but they were expecting another; Louis and Florence came from the ranch they lived on west of town with their one daughter and two sons; Arthur and Millie too lived close to the old home with their two little boys, the second hardly three months old, the youngest of the crowd. Albert and Jennie drove down from Manti with their two girls and two boys, the last boy not quite five months old. Andrew and Sarah with one daughter and two sons had the farthest to come since they lived in Salt Lake City and likely took the train down. Vena was of course at home, and being still single was expected, we suppose, to help with all the extra work brought on by a gathering of this kind. Tresia, though of course invited, was working in Salt Lake City and could not get away. What a happy gathering this must have been - forty-six wonderful people in one big family, with a good showing of males to carry on the Christensen name, each of the six Christensen sons having two living sons apiece.

Chris was then overseer of all the herds of the Julius Christensen estate and had some herds of his own. There was good money then in sheep. Lou and Arthur were working with Chris, taking care of some of the herds. Andrew was Principal of the L. D. S. High School in Salt Lake City. Joseph was Principal of the Gunnison District School and Bishop of the Gunnison Ward as well. Albert was a successful practicing attorney in Manti and had his eye on a judgeship. The two older girls were successfully married, Elsie to a sheepman and Emma to a farmer and rancher.<span id="page-369"></span> 
The ever-loving Vena was always a great help in her parent's home and also in the homes of her brothers and sisters whenever needed. Truly these were sons and daughters to be proud of.

Andrew's and Sarah's Edith (Edythe) has such happy rememberings of this and other holiday occasions, when their family returned to Gunnison when she was a child:-- "I recall wonderful family reunions at the old Christensen homestead in Gunnison among our beloved grandparents, the erect, aristocratic-looking Laurs Mathias and the stately patrician-in-homespun Else Kathrine, and the families of relatives. Their welcome seemed so genuine - with no exceptions. Grandmother C's welcome came straight from the heart. It was honest and all-enveloping! Anything she had was 'yours for the asking'. The uncles would either proudly or shyly ask questions and tell us of many things. The aunts, less reticent, took us into their hearts and arms. They then proceeded to 'kill the fatted calf' or poultry; to bake unbelievably light breads, rolls and cakes; pick the choicest produce from their garden and bring out their special pride in pickles, jellies and jams. Ice was brought from the sawdust and a large freezer of ice cream was on the way. Need I give the amount of thick jersey cream and the number of fresh eggs that were poured into these makings? Oh, these were the times of feasting, visiting and comparing notes for the adults; and for the children, a never-to-be-forgotten opportunity with cousins, more cousins - and double cousins. If the events resulted in a family group picture by a professional, as it did during at least two of these reunions, we today are all most grateful to have such records of those choice gatherings."

A photographer had been arranged for to take a group picture of the entire family during this reunion, and all were lined up in due time on the sidewalk in front of the home. Chairs were placed for Laurs and Else and the married women. Rugs were spread in front for some of the children while others sat or leaned on their mothers. Pearl, Elora, Harold and Aunt Vena stood up in back with the men, some of whom were holding little ones.<span id="page-370"></span> 
I remember how long it seemed to take before everyone was arranged just so, and how hot the sun was. Some children kept squirming around as the photographer, under his black camera cover, tried to adjust his equipment. Other children ran here and there and had to be constantly brought back. The ground where I sat was so hard it was difficult to find a comfortable way of sitting. I put my legs out straight in front of me and mother Jennie said, "Sit with crossed legs dear, like your cousins." I tried for a time but got tired - so put my knees up. Mother said, "Put your legs down dear, it isn't nice to sit like that." I put my legs down. "Why can't Elaine and I change places?" I complained. "Why does she have to sit on a chair with the big people?" I might have known this was the only way they could keep her in tow. Sherman kept pulling off his starched cap and father kept putting it back on his head - Dad was so proud of that little Buster Brown suit mother had made from "Indian Head". Mother had a brush and every time I squirmed she smoothed down my hair with it. I was so envious of Ruth Ellen's ringlets, tied up with a bow, and Edith's long ribbon-tied braids - not a hair out of place! Byron kept reaching over and pulling LaFaun's long crimped hair until Aunt Emma slapped his hands. A. Owen kept whining for a drink until the other children took up the refrain and Aunt Vena went and brought a dipperful of water from the well and each took a sip, as far as it went - "Don't dare drink too much" Aunt Elsie warned sharply! Several tries were made but every time the picture-taking-man went to snap, some child made a dash out of the lineup. Grandfather had to hold Melrose down between his knees to keep him from running. At last, when all seemed serene and ready and the big moment had come, the photographer held up his hand and prepared to shoot and we were about to be taken, when it was discovered that Elmer and Roy were missing - there they were up in the tree! How that photograph ever turned out so well I'll never know, for only grandmother looked frazzled in it, although most of the others must have felt that way before the end. And guess what? I was caught with my knees up - Wouldn't you know it?

<span id="page-371"></span> 
The folks had a dozen or more copies of the picture made, one for each family and some extras to send to their dear relations in Denmark for Christmas that year. That their Danish kinfolk received and appreciated the same is indicated in this translation of two letters received by the folks later, one from grandmother's sister Stine and one from Stine's husband, Svend Poulsen:--

"Monday Evening, 27 Jan. 1908
"Dear Sister Else:

"I will tonight try to write a letter to you, our dear family, thanking you very much for the picture you sent us. It is really fun to see so many people on one piece of paper. Yes, all the little faces, how pretty they are - all of them. It is so much fun to see "Sotter Anders", as the children say. Yes him we have seen in person you know and liked him at once - yes he won all of us! It would make us happy to see him among us again. Maybe some of his sisters and brothers will come sometime, but I guess you "Old Ones" won't come. It is sad that you dear sister should be so far away from us. Now soon eighteen years have gone by since you visited us. I am much better now than when you were here. I thought just now that if it were now that you had come, I could really be happy. But thanks because you made the trip before, it was glorious to see you then and it was such a strenuous trip. It is good to know you have been strong and had good health, this is one of the great blessings in life. Next Oct. 12th I will turn sixty years old and I guess you are about two years older, if I remember right. It isn't much I am getting written for my husband is sitting here on my right and is also busy writing to you. We have sometimes said if we could just get to know the date of your husband's birthday then we would surprise him with a greeting. We hear from him so often and on the picture he
looks very good. We wish it was clearer of you but it is not easy to get so many on such a little space. Again thanks for the picture and thanks because you write to the folks in Thorsted, then we also hear of you through them. But now when you get our new address, we hope you will write<span id="page-372"></span> 
to us sometime. Love to you all from your sister,

Ane Kirstine Andersen
(Stine Poulsen)"

"Dear Brother in Law and Family

"I also bring you thanks for the picture you sent us. Is it not strange that the number of people increase so much? When we look at the picture we realize that where there were about forty years ago only two people, now there are forty-six. Yes, yes, a half dozen strangers have come into the family but in spite of that it is still strange that the number has grown so large so fast. The best thing about it all is that they look like healthy people - all of them! I wonder if any of the many children and grandchildren will ever come to Little Denmark, the birthplace of the two "Old Ones"? It should be fun to see some of them over here. It is often now you know that people from the Far West visit Europe - even Denmark gets a few guests from there. Yes, I know we have had the pleasure of seeing one of the brood over here, namely Anders, which all of us in the family are so fond of. I don't know if he will see this letter, if not tell him hello from us and give him thanks because he has been so friendly as to come and visit us for some days here in Denmark. It would make us happy if he would write us a letter and tell us about his stay in Europe after he left us, if he had any profit out of his trip and stay in the famous places. It would also be very pleasant to hear what he is doing, if he is a teacher for a group of young folks or if he writes books.

"Yes, now our children are also grown up. The youngest, Viggo, will turn nineteen this 27th of April. But he is not well and is at present at the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, but we hope he will be cured - he also has good hopes for himself. There are so many here who have that sickness; at the place where Viggo is they have 170 patients. Our next youngest is Askel, he is twenty-two years old. He is attending High School this winter and is going in the military service in the fall. Next in line comes Holger who is twenty-four. He was home to celebrate Christmas vacation and then<span id="page-373"></span> 
went back to South Jutland. Kristine comes next, she is twenty-six years old. She is maid at the school. Then comes Dagmar who is thirty-one years old and works in Copenhagen. She was also home for Christmas vacation. Last comes Signe, and as you know she too is working at the High School. She is thirty-two. Then of course there are us two Old Ones, who are fine when we have our health but it is a little difficult with that once in a while. Though we as you know don't earn money here as you can over there, we still get along well and hope that it will still be better now that everybody is going to have equal rights. A
person will get the same right to speak, whether he be a day laborer or a rich farm owner and women will get the right to vote now too. I think they will have some influence, especially on the matters of schools and public welfare, for as you know the women have more warm heartedness in things like that. Yes the times have changed very much here at home since you left, and that in most everything concerned. I wonder how it will be in another forty years? But I guess it has changed even more where you live. I have read an account of the train which you traveled by when you went over there in 1866 - that must have been no joke! Friendly greetings to the whole family from us and our children.

Svend Poulsen
"Rosenly", Vinding, Vejle, Denmark."

Yes, as Svend Poulsen had said, things were changing, and this was true in Gunnison Valley. In about 1907 the cream separator had been introduced there. Before that all milk had been skimmed by hand, except for the time when in one household the milk pans had been skimmed off for several mornings and no one could tell how or by whom. But everyone was being blamed until someone chanced to go to the cellar at dusk one evening and there found a blow-snake of immense size daintily siphoning off the precious cream. . . In May 1900 the Bell Telephone Company had run a toll line through Sanpete and Sevier. The poles through Gunnison had been set down the middle of Main Street. The town had subscribed for one<span id="page-374"></span> 
telephone, which was installed in a shop-residence. When a call came in a messenger was sent to bring the person wanted to the telephone. In 1907 Leo Gledhill, Millie's older brother, had improved on this by building a one circuit line in Gunnison, with signal ringing. Using a combination of short and long signals each subscriber did his own ringing and every ring came in loud and clear on every phone. But this system was also unsatisfactory and Mr. Gledhill was appointed to work out a bigger, better telephone service, and so in 1909 the Gunnison Telephone Company was organized, with a magneto switchboard being installed on the second floor of the postoffice and operated by Mary Gledhill. Forty telephones were installed that year with rates 50&cent; per month for residents and $1.00 for businesses, one being installed in the home of Gunnison's new Mayor, Joseph Christensen. . . Familiar sights in Gunnison before 1910 were the water barrel wagons making their rounds carrying that good tasting drinking water from Peacock Springs southeast of Sterling, to the many customers in Gunnison; for Gunnison drinking water in general tasted so terrible. When, in 1909, Centerfield and Mayfield were incorporated as towns and Gunnison became a third class city, the first big project of Gunnison City Council, under Mayor Joseph Christensen, was to purchase the Peacock Springs and have the water piped to Gunnison. Trenches were dug, pipes laid, and water made available to all the homes there by 1910. . . And there were seasons in those early years of the new century when the mice were so plentiful and playful that it took a truly brave man to stand up before the pulpit and address the congregation. Many a hero had the actual experience of having a mouse scamper up and down his trouser leg. In those days, so it has been said, the closing prayers in church meetings, unlike the long drawn-out ones of before, were short and streamlined and sometimes ended with "Amen, I caught 'im". Believe it or not, Uncle Joseph Christensen must have been among the brave then, since he presided as Gunnison's Bishop most of the first decade of this century.

## DESTINY TAKES A HAND
<span id="page-375"></span>

Laurs and Else, freed from most of the responsibilities of their big family, began to go more often to the temple. Else had kept up a fitful correspondence with her kinfolk in Denmark since her return from there and Laurs had written to them also. He liked to write letters much better than Else and was a good penman. In spite of the fact that they usually requested some genealogical information when they wrote, little came back to them. Andrew had brought back some bits of data gleaned while he was there but it was little enough. The urge to know more of their relatives, especially their dead, was always with them. The death of an aunt here - an uncle there - a cousin married - a niece or nephew born - everything of the sort was set down quickly in their joint Temple Record Book as a source and reminder of future work to be taken care of in the temples of the Most High. Only those who have truly experienced the Spirit of Elijah can appreciate what these records of their kindred meant to them. The first part of the year 1907 they had spent a great deal of time in the Manti Temple finishing the ordinance work for all of their dead whose records they had. Temple work was the work to which they both now wished to dedicate the remainder of their lives, aside from the precious time they would spend with their ever-increasing offspring.

They didn't remain living in Gunnison long enough to enjoy good spring water tapped into their home there, nor did they stay long enough to have a telephone put in. According to the early Gunnison Ward records their church memberships were removed to Manti, Utah 15 Feb. 1909. It seems, however, that before settling in Manti they spent some time living in Salt Lake City and
working in the temple there, perhaps at their son Andrew's suggestion, since he and his family were living there then. It has been said that they lived some west of the temple down below the viaduct at the time. Eventually, however, they settled in Manti in a fair sized adobe house on the corner of<span id="page-376"></span> 
what is now First North and First East streets. Besides the house there was a barn on the place with room for a horse and a cow or two, also plenty of room for a few pigs, lambs, chickens, geese, a garden and some berry bushes on the lot.

But then a plan was born - or perhaps it came to mind while they were rummaging through their important papers earlier, preparing to move.  Could it have been that Laurs happened upon his blessing given him in Christenburg in 1884 and took time to re-read it? Likely. Much that had been promised him at the time had come to pass and much was promised for the distant future. "Ja, Ja, all this is wonderful and fine," he must have thought. . . "Your life shall be spared long upon the earth". . . "Ja, Ja!" But it was the part that came next that must have bothered him and set his mind working on it. . . "The still small voice will say to you - 'Go back to your native land where you shall bear witness of the Gospel for your relatives and friends, both the high and the low.  You shall do many works in their midst, as the Angels of the Lord shall prepare the way and the wisdom of the Holy Ghost be given you. . ." Now how could he himself just ignore this part of his blessing and expect the continued blessings of heaven?

Else must have readily agreed that Laurs should return to the Old Country and also that she herself should return with him, since she still had so little of her own genealogy. There would never again be a better time for them for they were not
getting any younger! But what about money? They would talk to the boys, perhaps some of them could help a little with that since most were doing well. And perhaps Louis and Florence would buy their Gunnison place instead of just renting it as they were doing. Vena could of course stay with Emma, who was so in need of help now. Thus Laurs and Else had talked and planned and the immediate future took on a glow of anticipation. But when they spoke to Andrew about it he encouraged them to wait<span id="page-377"></span> 
yet another year, for he had also been making plans to return to Europe and take up the studies that had been interrupted by Adelbert's death. This time he wanted to take his family along, and it would be better to wait until their new little daughter, Elsie Eliza, was a little older and thus better able to travel. If they themselves would wait another year, they could all go over together!

Laurs and Else pondered Andrew's advice and decided to wait. Then Else wrote the exciting news to her loved ones in Jutland, for she could not keep it, and Laurs wrote to them also and to his brother Christen. -- Oh that they two should meet once again in this life! It didn't take long at all for letters to come back from some of Else's loved ones, all in the same envelope, and she and Laurs read them aloud to each other in Danish, as they were written, and rejoiced for they knew they would see the writers in person 'ere long. Following are translations of these letters:

"Thorsted, Denmark
15 April 1909

"Dear sister and family:--

Thank you very much for your letter, it was a great joy to all of us. But I will admit that I feel a little ashamed because I haven't written for so long. I have often thought about it. Yes, dear sister, I, like you, pray for us Old Ones and the Young Ones too and thank the good Lord our Father for all his gracious gifts to us. It is almost more than I can believe that you can take that long journey again, but may it be a successful one and know that here will be joy and that we will take care of you as well as we can. We still live in our home. Mikkel is well and can go about both home and outside and the same is true of me. We have Frederick, Maren and Holger home and those who are out are doing fine too. We don't have as many grandchildren as you but we only have two who are married so it is understandable that we are in lesser number. Jens has nine healthy children and Kristian one who is two years old. Yes, when you get to Thorsted you can visit all of your family. Sister Marie and brother Lars are fine but I guess they will write. I am sending a view of sister <span id="page-378"></span> 
Stine's home at the time Anders was here in Denmark. He visited Svend and Stine in Vinding by Vejle. As you know their daughter Signe was married to the Principal of the High School, but he died last summer so she sold the school and has bought our old house. Svend was here in March to buy a piece of land. We expect him any day now. He will build their new house himself you know. Stine will stay at Signe's place till the house is finished. Svend shall then stay with us in the meantime. Their lot is not more than five minutes walk from our house so believe me Stine and I are looking forward to living so close to each other. Dear sister, we don't have much to complain about reading your writing but it may be hard for you to read mine. You said that it was the time for sowing when you wrote. Here it is different for after having a mild winter now we have had three days of heavy snowing and today the men have been out shoveling snow to get the road passable. This is something none of us ever remember having happened before right in the middle of April - but it will do much good anyway. It is good to have a sure leader to trust in so we have reason to be happy children.

"Yes, dear friends, I must close for it is always a hard task for me to write and for that I am sorry since there is an old saying which goes, 'If you make me happy you make me good', and I know we can make each other happy by writing. But when we meet and talk together that will be even better. Tell Anders Hello for us Old Ones and the Young Ones too. Those were happy days we had when he was here. Yes, how time goes by - it is now five years ago soon. But how happy we are for your picture. We have to search long to find a family as big and nice as this one! With this I will say goodby and God's peace with us all, your Sister - Karen."

"Dear Relatives Far Away:

"Mother has now written and asks me to send a little greeting too. I thought that she probably had told everything so that there was no news left for me to tell. It is too bad that my dear cousin<span id="page-379"></span> 
Elvena cannot read my letters for then it would be her rather than you that I wrote to. Dear Aunt, if it really should come true that you will visit us next summer how happy we will be! We will treat you as good as we can in every way - but cannot cousin Elvena come with you? I think it would be nice for you too if she did and we would look forward to that very much. You write that she just turned twenty-two. I turned twenty-five on the second of April. This must be the time we celebrate birthdays. Tell dear, good Anders 'hello' for us many times and congratulate him on his little children. Wasn't it his oldest son who passed away? Dear friends, if it just hadn't been so far between us then maybe there could have been a possibility for me to visit you for I still have a desire to get out, really out and try and see what I can amount to. Maybe my opportunity will come someday. Mother is well - she can do things herself. Father will turn seventy-four on the first of September. He has good health too so I should really take the opportunity to get away now. Receive, all of you, the most loving greetings from your niece and cousin - Maren Skaarup.

Tornely, Den. 17 Apr. 1909"

"Dear Aunt Else:

"Now that mother is planning on writing you I would like to send along some word too. Yes, you must come next summer for sure, and couldn't Elvena come too? You say that you are thinking of letting your son Louis have your home in Gunnison, then I guess Elvena could come with you and you could close the house you have now. Uncle Svend's family is up here in Thy now. As you know, they are going to live out at Thorsted. I have been working in an embroidery shop in Thisted for fifteen months. I finished my apprenticeship in January and have been working for wages since. I shall now, this May, go to Salling High School for the months of May, June and July as a student and to help with sewing classes at the school. The pay is 40 Kr. besides the tuition.

"There is going to be a big Festival in Aarhus this summer which will start in May. It said in<span id="page-380??"></span> 
the paper about a month ago that they would have to work both nights and holidays to get ready by then. Be sure and tell Anders "hello' for me. Maybe he can hardly remember me as you know I was small and not yet confirmed when he was here. I am now a good sixteen years old. I guess I will write the return address on the letter as plainly as I can. I am enclosing a picture of myself which I would like cousin Elvena to have - it is the last I had taken. I am sewing much so I shall have all my clothes ready for school as we been unable to get a serving girl. Mother tells me so often about Aunt Else so I know you well although I have never seen you. Now I will close with many greetings of love to all the many cousins but mostly to Elvena, Anders and you two dear Old Ones. From your niece, Edel Christensen.            Tornely, Thisted, Denmark."

"Dear Sister Else, husband and children:

"Now that my daughter Edel has written such a long letter I will just add thanks for your letter which we were so happy to receive and for the hope it awakened in us of seeing you again once more in this life. Yes dear sister, we would all be so happy if you and your husband would risk the trip again. I guess it is I now who am the Old One for I am not very well as my weight is so high. I am 200 lbs. and my legs are bad since I suffer from vericose veins. However summer is the best time for me. Tell Anders 'Hello', we all remember him with great warmth. Tell all of your other loved ones and your husband the same also but receive for yourself a big and loving greeting from my husband and me - Marie."

As it turned out Laurs and Else were probably thankful that they had waited and not gone back to the land of their ancestors that year, for it was a period of birth and deaths, happiness and sorrowing for members of their family and they were on hand to share in both. It started out in February of that year when Arthur, a twin himself, was presented with twin girls by his wife Millie. But let the oldest of these, Cousin Grace, tell the story:--<span id="page-381"></span> 
"Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging kerosine lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me, for I was there and heard the bang! Our parents were proud and happy with their enlarged family - four children under the age of four. Then too, the way things happened was quite the talk around town. I was born about twenty minutes before midnight on Feb. 16th 1909 and Gladys was born about twenty minutes after midnight on Feb. 17th - twins born on different days. This was quite a drain on mother's health and so it was decided that Aunt Vena Christensen should take me and Aunt Mary Gledhill should take Gladys, until mother regained her strength." Aunt Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) now well past eighty, continues the story:-- "When Grace and Gladys were born Grace, a large blond Christensen baby, came first, not long before midnight. About two hours later, not long after midnight, Gladys, a tiny, sickly, dark complexioned baby that looked like the Gledhills, came. Millie, in her hysteria, refused to own the second baby. Dr. Hagan put her in my charge - they didn't expect the little thing to live. I cared for Gladys in my room at home where I fed her with an eye dropper for two weeks, a mixture of whisky and something else the doctor put with it, which probably helped to save her life."

Though Dr. Hagan delivered the majority of babies now in Gunnison, you could bet if a new one was arriving at any of the Christensen's homes, either grandmother Else K., Aunt Vena or both would be right there to help out, before and after. And a number of other babies were expected by the Christensens within the year. Arthur's and Millie's twins weren't a dozen days old when Joseph and Roxie had another child at their place, the seventh, but only the fourth to live. This one was a big, long, hungry baby and Roxie had far too little milk to satisfy him. So every few hours someone took him over to his Aunt Millie's for an extra breast nursing, since she had plenty for the twins and some to spare for Virgil. Not to be outdone then, Chris and Caroline brought forth their seventh child and third son, Farrald, the very first part of that September. And a month<span id="page-382"></span> 
and a few days after Farrald arrived, Louis and Florence had their fifth child, the first baby to be born in the old Gunnison homestead since Vena, as far as we know. Little brown-eyed Dale helped to compensate for the loss of baby Spencer, who had been laid away by Louis and Florence some seventeen months earlier. Thus five more grandchildren were quickly added to Laurs' and Else's posterity - jewels in their crowns! Else K. at least was most likely present to greet each one on arrival.

But - "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. . . " On Sat. 18 Dec. 1909 Elsie's and Alma's little son Byard died. He was then a beautiful child of four years nine months and sixteen days, but had always had an incurable heart condition. Alma was on the desert with the sheep at the time and Elsie was expecting again soon. She and grandmother were alone with the little one when he passed away. His burial was delayed until Alma could be notified and return to Gunnison. On Wednesday afternoon, two days before Christmas, a brief funeral service was held at the residence. Thus over a happy home the shadow of a little grave fell. But exactly seven weeks later Elsie had a beautiful baby girl to fill her empty arms. This Edith was so welcome, not alone because of her little brother's passing but also because she was the first daughter, following four sons.

Emma and Charles had also known much sorrow in the past two years, having lost two baby daughters in stillbirth, one right after the other. Neither were named. Their oldest daughter Ada, though quite young at the time, says she distinctly remembers the last of these little ones in her box-casket lying there perfectly formed like a beautiful doll. She just couldn't understand why this baby sister wouldn't wake up - she so much wanted a little sister to play with for she had only Byron. Charles buried each of the little corpses on their ranch there, across the wash some distance from the house. But then Ada got a real live sister when Emma gave birth to a healthy baby girl, 13 Jan. 1910, who later received the name Imelda.
<span id="page-383"></span> 
A few years before, Andrew and Sarah had purchased a lovely home in Salt Lake City on 27th South and 9th East. The story went that it had been built by President John Taylor, so Edythe says, and she continues:-- "The house was of brick, with an artistic front porch and roof from which jutted dormer windows. The glass of the front parlor window was of good dimension with an upper panel of colored glass. The home was of two stories. A couple of the upstairs bedrooms had windows facing the west from which we could watch the sunsets with their colored reflections upon Great Salt Lake, as well as the snow-capped mountains of the Ochre (Oquirrh?) range in winters. The annual fireworks displays of old Wandemere Park were exciting delights on July Fourth and Twenty-Fourth nights. It was like having reserved seats to the very best shows.

"The grounds were extensive. Many homes have since been built upon the area that was then our lot. Fruit trees of all varieties, raspberries, strawberries, and different kinds of currants grew abundantly. There was much garden space. The property even boasted a windmill but this father took down to avoid the danger of having it crash onto the roof in a strong wind. A big stream of water gushed from a pipe on the property, but whether its source was from a spring or an artesian well I do not know. Father envisioned our own fish pond and proceeded to have one excavated, lined with cement and stocked with an abundance of trout. It was later protected with a high mesh fence when the second daughter of the family, Elsie Eliza, came along; for from the time she could toddle she was fascinated with this pond. The fence had a padlocked gate to permit easy entrance to the pond when necessary.

"Sometime later, in fact Friday 8 April 1910, my two younger brothers and I were hard bent on 'jumping the rope'. It was the rage at school and Wendell and I hoped to perfect our form. We were down in the orchard some distance from the house. Mother had commissioned us to watch out for seventeen-month-old Elsie who had also come out of doors to play, but was not with us. We had<span id="page-384"></span> 
looked toward the fish pond and the gate appeared closed so we looked no further. After a time mother called from the back door, "Have you seen Elsie?" The rope was thrown down and we scattered to search. I reached the pond. The gate was now ajar, apparently it had been pushed closed but not locked. There, peacefully floating on the water, baby face to the sky was our little sister. I was quickened and stunned by remorse - why hadn't I gone out to the gate and really checked - why hadn't I watched more closely and kept the baby with us? I wrestled with myself and even yet, after all these years, I feel responsible for that tragedy. A small funeral service was held in our parlor a few days later and Elsie was buried in the family plot at the Provo City Cemetery beside our brother Adelbert. I never 'jumped the rope' again, nor could I even bear to watch the school groups jumping the rest of that spring."

Nevertheless this was not the end of the grief for the Christensens. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We, Albert and Jennie and family, lived in the John Maiben home in Manti which we were renting while our new house was being finished, our old one having been sold. Elaine and I had just returned from Sunday School, it being Sunday 22 May 1910. We found mother in the parlor, accompanying herself on the organ and singing that very old hymn, "Who are those arrayed in white, brighter than the noonday sun. . ." At least these were the words she was singing, if not the title of the song. Father was out of town on court business. A messenger came to the door - Father was wanted on the community telephone, long distance.  Mother went to take the call - she seemed worried.  She came back in a few minutes, tears streaming down her face. Cousin Orilla, Chris' and Caroline's daughter Elaine's age had just passed away with scarlet fever. Others of their children were down sick with it also. The funeral would not be held until they could get word to Uncle Chris who was up on "The Weber". They would let us know later. Five days after, Friday 27 May, about the same time of day as Sunday, mother was again seated at the organ playing and singing "Who are those arrayed in white. . .", when a girl from the<span id="page-385"></span> 
telephone office came the second time to call mother to the telephone - long distance. "It must be word about the funeral" she said as she went out. Soon she returned almost beside herself with weeping. "Poor Chris - poor Caroline", I remember her sobbing; "Elora too has passed away with scarlet fever!"

Uncle Chris returned home just before Elora died but there had been nothing he or anyone else could do to save her. Joint funeral services were planned for the two sweet little girls, and since the family was in quarantine for this dreaded disease, as were numerous other families in the town, the services were held outside in front of the Christensen residence. Pearl remembers that her two younger sisters were dressed all in white for their burials and that for the funeral their caskets were lifted outside and propped up on one end so that the beautiful corpses, thirteen year old Elora with her long, waist-length blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, and seven-and-
a-half year old Orilla with her golden curls, could be more easily viewed by the mourners on the sidewalk. Mary Gledhill (Dowdle) remembers that the neighbor children and young people, herself among them, gathered and sat on the ditchbank across the road north to watch the sad proceedings, for these lovely girls had been friends of theirs. All were weeping.

"There is no death
The stars go down to rise upon a brighter shore
And bright in heaven's jeweled crown
They shine forevermore."

--Anon

Life is so uncertain - and best laid plans can go awry. Yet throughout the maze of births and sorrowful, unexpected deaths, Laurs and Else kept alive the hope of going back to Old Denmark. Now the time was fast approaching when they had hoped to join their loved ones there - and for this they fervently prayed. But would all that had happened put a damper on it? Would little Elsie Eliza's death change Andrew's and Sarah's plans? Encouraging letters came again from Else's people<span id="page-386"></span> 
and apparently they too were looking forward with hope for their visit to Denmark: --

"Tornely, Apr. 10, 1910
"Dear Sister with Husband and Children:

"Thank you very much for your long, loving letter and the pictures. Everything was received in good order. I was so amazed at the cover and everything - even the little string was so fun. To think that you dear sister had tied around it all! Yes, I can surely see that you have lost weight, but believe me I am far from a small thing - so big and fat! But I can move and if I didn't have these difficult legs I could tumble around well yet, but they are whole even if they are tired of the big
weight and vein knots. Otherwise I am fine and healthy if I can just avoid cold weather. So I would rather move into the city to live and get rid of the garden. My husband is striving with it at this time, planting potatoes, carrots, chervil, radishes, peas and onions. We are behind compared to you but they go along too, those who are behind. Yes, we would be so happy to see you so come as soon as you can! Now you can visit all four of us in one day. Svend and family live in a nice house in Thorsted. He will also put in a garden. I believe that sister Karen and Mikkel are thinking of giving the farm to some of their children but it won't likely be until next spring. Brother Mads' wife Else has been sick again this winter with stomach trouble and a weak lung. She is up a little now but looks terrible. They have their Edel at home but this May their daughter Marie is coming home from Sjaelland where she has been for many years, then Edel will go to High School.

"I guess my Edel will write you. She is home this month but is leaving again in May. She would be glad if she could see the much-talked-of Aunt Else. When she was younger she wanted to go over to see you she said. Now that the family have all seen your letter we will begin to answer so that you shall not miss getting word before you leave. Edel will write, and here with the most loving greetings to you, Christian, Anders and everybody, am I, 
Your sister, Marie Christensen"<span id="page-387"></span>
"Dear Sister:

"As I am staying with sister Marie at present, I will send you our greetings too as I don't think we will get to send a letter this time. At this time of year Svend is quite busy and he is taking a trip in a few days. But I can tell you that we are fine and really happy at the thoughts of seeing you dear ones, especially from so far away. Yes, if you just do come to Denmark once more! Loving greetings, your sister, Anne Kirstine (Stine)"

"Thorsted, Denmark
15 April 1910

"Dear friends in the distance:

To you dear sister, first we shall say thanks for your long letter. It is delightful hearing from you but when we have the wonderful joy of seeing you then will it be much more delightful. I can tell you that we are all well and have it good. Mikkel is still running the farm but it probably will be only one more year. He'll shortly be an old man for in September he will be seventy-five. But he is well and he gets around, away and at home, and that do we all. So we have so much to thank the good God Father for - yes his grace for us is more than we can comprehend. I know to begin with that I won't write as long a letter as you, dear sister. Brother Mads' wife is very sick and has been that way for a long time so we don't know if she is going to be here very long. But it all stands in God Father's hands, and since they rely on this it shouldn't be as hard on us friends as long as what happens is God's will. We have sent your letter back to Marie so don't have your new address but hope your old one will find you. I am supposed to say 'hello' from Svend and Stine, we are happy that they came to Thorsted. I will close with many loving greetings to you all.
Mikkel and Karen Skaarup. "

"Torneley, Denmark
17 Apr. 1910.

"Dear Aunt and whole family:<span id="page-388"></span> 
"At last I grab the pen and write. We had a sewing girl here last week and so I helped and have been so busy. I have had sewn some underclothing and a national costume. Of dresses and over-clothes I shall have nothing new since I was so well supplied last Spring. I am going to High School again this summer. Vallo High School is the one I will attend and O. P. Jensen is the name of the director.  It begins the fourth of May. I will teach handwork and gymnastics and take instruction in the remaining subjects. The school will be in session until August. Then I'm really going to start working, for if everything goes as we have figured, I will begin the middle of August at Silkeborg Seminary where I will have to go for four years to get my teacher's examination (degree). I have a tremendous desire to do this and father and mother have their hopes in me too. But father is getting old and will soon be seventy-four and that's really up in the years. However it is his greatest desire that I'll make something of myself - I am of course his baby girl.

"If you come this summer can't you make it so that you will be here in August? I would like to be here while you are here.  When Anders and his wife come to Europe we hope they will also come to Denmark's land. Thanks for the pictures. Mother let so many see Elvena's picture that when I got hold of it it was almost black. When she is photographed again I would put a great price on receiving a copy. But if she would come over here with it herself it would be all the more dearly come by. Elvena should not be afraid to come over here, when I get enough money there would be nothing I'd rather do than come over and visit my family in America. But it would only be for a visit as I could never leave our good Denmark. 

"I have to go in a little bit and that's why my writing is so choppy. But of course you'll forgive it for herewith is sent to the whole family best wishes from the inhabitants in Tornely, by your devoted - Edel Christensen."

## SOME DREAMS COME TRUE
<span id="page-389"></span>

In Salt Lake City, Andrew, doubtless thinking it best to get Sarah and the children away from the scene of their recent tragedy, resigned his position as Principal of the L. D. S. High School and continued his plans to take them all to Europe that summer of 1910. Sarah and the three children, putting aside their grief for brighter things as best they could, took on a project to help, as Edythe relates:-- "To raise extra money, mother took a strawberry patch in East Millcreek, on consignment. We drove out early and picked berries every other morning through the bearing season, then sold them dewy-fresh with heaped-up cups."

Though this must have been a difficult decision, Andrew and Sarah finally decided to sell their promising place there in order to finance the trip as well as his advanced schooling in Europe. Learning that Chris had decided to leave Gunnison and settle Caroline and the children in Salt Lake where they would be nearer "The Weber" and his work, Andrew approached his older brother on the subject. Edythe writes of this also:-- "Our home was sold to father's older brother, the wonderful Chris I. I have been told by his daughter Pearl, that her parents had already decided to purchase another Salt Lake home before father approached
them with the need to sell. His family changed their plans as an accommodation to us. I hope, however, that they felt some of the joy that we had in the old place."

Laurs and Else and Andrew and his family left for Europe that midsummer of 1910, but as things happened they didn't travel there together after all. Laurs and Else made arrangements to travel with some L. D. S. missionaries, "3 Klasse", while Andrew and family went a little earlier in July and doubtless had better accommodations. Again we turn to Edythe's history for the details of their travel then:-- "Father, mother, Wendell age 7, Sheldon age 4, and I age 10, left in early July for Europe. Father's parents were to meet us later in Denmark, to visit among the<span id="page-390"></span> 
relatives there. Wherever we went, Father always 'put himself out' to give us all the cultural and educational experiences he could - bless him! We traveled first by train to Montreal, Canada. The fortress-like city of Quebec was also a stopover. In each place sites pertinent to early colonial history were visited and the events explained in bright detail. Our ship was of the White Star Line. We cruised along the St. Lawrence River to its mouth, then into the rough Atlantic. After one meal or two mother, Sheldon and I were confined to our quarters for the duration of the voyage. Father and Wendell were not at all affected by the sickness-of-the-sea, nor did they hesitate to boast of it.

"Many others had been ill enroute and so it was in part a pretty peaked-looking group that docked on that one particular afternoon at Liverpool, England, where we were soon taken to a modest hotel in time for a late 'tea'. This consisted of a platter of thinly sliced white bread spread with sweet imported Danish butter to go with our glasses of milk. In no time the rounds of bread disappeared - they had the taste of ambrosia to us. The serving woman almost despaired of filling up 'those Americans'. By morning a 'milk strike' was on and from our hotel windows we heard the clatter of horse-drawn carts and witnessed cans of the precious white liquid being dumped out on the streets.

"We then journeyed to London for a few days sightseeing, taking in many worthwhile things such as the British Museum, Christopher Wren's handsomely designed Church of St, Paul, and Westminster Abbey, etc., and then went on to Oxford. Here we were settled in a large, comfortable and clean upstairs sittingroom, which served also as a dining room and partial bedroom, with another small bedroom adjoining. And there was a precious English garden enclosed by a wall, at the rear of the house. The place was owned by two spinster sisters who insisted on marketing, cooking and washing up. The tasteful English food was served
in covered dishes delivered to our door each mealtime, with the necessary plates and silver. No<span id="page-391"></span>
shopping for groceries - no cooking - no washing dishes! Imagine the wave of luxury that came over our hard-working mother and how she blossomed into increased loveliness under this release from care.

"Father enrolled at Christs College - one of the many in that educational city of renown. There were few afternoons following his classes that he did not take us through some part of the venerable quaintness of Old Oxford: Green lawns stretching everywhere with trees and shrubs in abundance, leaves just turning their color, and a profusion of flowers that fairly took our breaths away; a lazy river winding its way through, on which we sometimes rowed; parks inhabited by bushy-tailed squirrels and small tame deer; horse-drawn streetcars on which we occasionally rode; interesting and quaint shops, book stalls and stores,
collectors dreams, in which we often browsed; and old, sometimes crumbling vine-covered churches whose musty-smelling doors were always open and into which we never failed to enter."

* * * * *

In the meantime, back in Zion, Laurs and Else were ready to leave for Denmark at last. They had secured and thoroughly investigated literature and instructions pertaining to a journey of this kind.

Passports were not required to secure admission to Denmark, but they were useful or necessary as a means of identification, or in proof of citizenship. They should be exhibited wherever evidence of citizenship was required. Since Laurs had never served in the military in Denmark, and although he was now far too old for such service and besides had been a naturalized American citizen for well over thirty years, having declared his intentions to become one 2nd Aug. 1875, in the First Judicial District Court of the United States in Provo, Utah, still he had no mind to take any chances in Old Denmark. So he applied for and secured his passport, which came with the following "NOTICE: The person to whom this passport is issued is hereby directed to affix his signature<span id="page-392"></span>
thereon, in the space designated, immediately upon its receipt. . . etc. . . etc. . . American citizens who expect to make a prolonged stay in any foreign country should apply for consular registration to the American Consulate in that country. . . P. C. Knox - Dept. of State, Washington, April 11, 1910." Else of course had her passport from before.

The couple had arranged to travel from Salt Lake City with a group of Europe-bound missionaries, two of whom were going to Denmark, Elders John Elmer Larsen of Tabor, Canada, and Hans Sanders of Salt Lake City. They had received their letters of instructions which read as follows:-- "INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITORS WHO ACCOMPANY THE EUROPEAN PARTY LEAVING JULY 13th. . .Your train leaves Oregon Shortline Depot 5:15 p.m, Wednesday:-- The Oregon Short Line Ry. to Ogden; the Union Pacific Ry. to Omaha, the Chicago Great Western Ry. Omaha to Chicago. Your rail ticket is all in one ticket for the entire party between Salt Lake and Chicago, and is held by the Elder in charge of the company. If you have a trunk to check you should be at the Oregon Short Line depot baggage room not later than 4 p.m. Wednesday. The Elder in charge has an order to get your rail ticket from Chicago to Montreal that is paid for, and you hold your own steamship ticket. The large new steamer "Megantic" that you go on, sails from Montreal at daybreak Saturday the 23rd, and passengers sleep on board the steamer the night before. Liverpool address; Durham House, 295 Edge Lane, Liverpool, England."

Else had procured a small notebook in which she copied addresses, any genealogical information she happened across, and a sort of day by day account of their travels, and from this we copy:-- "Left our home in Manti on the 9th of July (1910); left Salt Lake City on the 13th; came to Omaha on the 15th; came to Chicago on the 16th; left there on the 17th July; came to Buffalo on the 18th; came to Montreal, Canada on the 19th of July, going on the ship the evening of the 22nd July." This was Laurs' sixty-third birthday and he may have recalled the last time he was in Canada, which was exactly forty-four years before, when<span id="page-393"></span>
they rode the abominable cattle cars on their way to Zion in 1866 as newly arrived Danish emigrants. In fact it was in Montreal that they had first boarded those filthy boxcars. Laurs had spent his nineteenth birthday those many years ago crossing over from Canada into the United States. Who would have dreamed then that he would return again to Montreal? Neither could they know now that the day before, 21 July 1910, brother Mads' dear wife Else had passed away in Denmark. The two sisters-in-law named Else would never meet again in this life, or would Laurs ever meet Mads' wife, as he'd expected, but the others of his wife's kin by the grace of heaven he would soon see - and also Christen, his only living full brother! Can we imagine the stirring of his emotions as he thought upon these meetings?

Now continuing Else's account of their journey:-- "We started to sail the morning of the 23rd July, on the ship S. S. Megantic; came to Liverpool 30 July; crossed over from England to Grimby on the lst of August on the ship Vicaria; came to Esbjerg on the west coast of Jutland on the 3rd of August in the morning; came to Thisted the same day in the afternoon." Here at Thisted they must have been met by some of Else's folks from nearby Thorsted, perhaps Mikkel Skaarup, who had come for Else before. And when they had come to the village of Thorsted perhaps the flags were flying again to greet them, for this was the Danish way to celebrate. And what a family reunion and festival that must have been, though surely somewhat tempered by the grief that still clung to them because of Mads' wife's passing. And what wonderful days those must have been that followed, with all four sisters, their companions and brother Mads together, along with all the nieces and nephews who could manage to be there for the welcoming of their Aunt Else and Uncle Laurs from America. That "Uncle Laurs" fit right in with the crowd can well be imagined, for with his good natured disposition, kindliness and rare diplomacy, not to mention his ever ready Danish wit, he must have won them all over, both the Old Ones and the young.

* * * * *

<span id="page-394"></span>But Laurs and Else were not the only ones from the Mormon state who were traveling to Denmark at the time. President Joseph F. Smith, his wife and son and Presiding Bishop Charles W. Nibley, his wife and two daughters, had arrived in Copenhagen July 27th and were in the process of visiting many of the various branches in the Mission, including the one at Aalborg. They were being accompanied by Andrew Jenson, then President of the Mission. These brethren from Zion spoke to capacity audiences wherever they visited and Brother Jenson showed slides and pictures of outstanding places in Mormondom. It was a most successful missionary venture on the part of these brethren, according to former Church Historian, Andrew Jenson, and the Danish and Norwegian newspapers published many favorable comments on the same, although there were others who railed against them. This was said to be the first time in history that either a President or a Presiding Bishop of the L. D. S. Church had visited in Scandinavia.

The publicity given these L. D. S. Authorities doubtless made it somewhat easier for Laurs, in his kind way, to try and open up friendly conversations on the subject of religion, as if the way had been paved by a higher power. Nevertheless, even though Jutland Danes were seldom silent and usually began each sentence with a "Ja" or a "Nej" and ended each question with an "eh", yet when the Gospel and its principles were mentioned there were never any "Jas", "Nejs!"-or "ehs", only silence. So how in the world could Laurs, Else or anyone else tell what was on their minds then? It was a bit discouraging to the would-be missionaries.

Yet the welcome given the two by Else's people was warm and sincere in every other respect; and who can say no sparks of truth were lighted there? After a few days of it in Thorsted, Laurs and Else were on their way again, going south from Thisted by train to visit numbers of other relatives, as Else wrote in her notebook:-- "Came to Hurup on 9th Aug. to Salmon Sorensen's my brother Mads' daughter Valborg's place; came to Christen "Flarups" the 10th of Aug. A.M, at<span id="page-395"></span> 
Nessum by Hurup."[^9] Christen Flarup was the name they called Laurs' brother Christen Christensen, but whether it was merely a nickname or whether he had assumed this name by then we know not. So it was here that the two brothers were reunited after forty-four years of separation, but whether this, their last meeting on earth, was all Laurs had hoped for aside from the aspect of religion, we are uncertain. As far as the Gospel was concerned, however, we have been told that his mission here was unsuccessful, for Christen would have none of it! But strange as it may seem, one of his two daughters later joined the L. D. S. Church there in Denmark, according to Aunt Sarah Christensen's understanding.

[^9]: Nessum=Naessund in Heltborg parish, where the births of Christen's children were recorded.
Christen and his wife Else Marie Andersen had twelve children, of whom one died in infancy, three in childhood, and one by drowning at 17 in the North Sea.  The rest eventually moved away.

Genealogical gatherings were interspersed among the travel entries in Eise's notebook, and according to these they must have visited relatives in Kjallerup, where she was born; Hvidbjerg Western, where she was christened a Lutheran; Bedsted (Bested) where she was baptized a Mormon; Kobberod where grandfather Laurs was born; Gettrup where his mother was born, and other places dear to their youths. Even though Else's "day-by-day" account does not list these places, her genealogical gleanings jotted down at the time do. After two days spent with Laurs' brother Christen, they parted from him and went on their way as follows;-- "Going to Laurs' cousins, Thomas (Nielsen) Wies from Nessum the 12th of Aug.; today the 19th Aug. evening - we are here in Tolbol with my cousin, Sidsel Marie Hvid (Madsen) and family; today is the 5th of Sept. - We are at the home of Mr. Svend Kirkagade; today is the 8th Sept. - we are now in Skive with Laurs' cousin, Peter Kvisgaard Poulsen (wife and one child), at 2 o'clock we will go on the water to Hvalpsund on the way to Nibe." Laurs made some notes of his own regarding this part of their journey in a small memorandum book, in this manner:-- "From Struer 9:22. In Skive 10:32 (here lives a son of Jens Kr. Poulsen, railroad assistant P. Poulsen.) From Skive with motorboat to Hvalpsund; In Nibe 6:39 - in Nibe lives Jens Kr. Poulsen's daughter-in-law, flower trader (florist), Signe Poulsen, from there to Grydsted School."<span id="page-396"></span>  
We continue Else's account:-- "Going to Aalborg 17th Sept. 1910. We are here in Aalborg 17th Sept, in this good home with some loving saints, Christen Pedersen and wife Kirstine Marie; Mrs, Marie Carlsen, 679 E, Jensen Ave., Salt Lake City, her father and mother live here in Aalborg - we must see them here and also go to L. D. S. Church headquarters here in Aalborg, at Borupsgade 12. Going back to Thisted tomorrow. In Aarhus the 20 Sept. in the home of Peter Forgesen Fisher, father and mother of Willardsen's wife Marie of Centerfield - also had word from her Aunt Anne. "Kobenhaven" 30 Sept. 1910, will see Hans Mortensen's girls here today."

So it seems Laurs and Else traveled from one end of Little Denmark to the other visiting their relatives, both close and distant, and also calling on relatives of friends back in Zion; and as they traveled to and fro the list of names and vital statistics of families they visited enroute grew and grew in Else's notebook. Sometime during their journey Else contacted a professional genealogist by the name of Jens C. Nielsen, and engaged him to search out the records of her noble progenitors, the Hvids - way back. Perhaps this was one of the things that took them to Copenhagen then as well as their desire to visit the L. D. S. headquarters there and greet mission president, Andrew Jenson, whom they had known so well since they traveled together on "Old Kenilworth".

Here one now saw ten bicycles to every motorcar and at noons or days ends the ratio was higher. Old-fashioned church gables still zigzagged on the sky, where they stood with their red tile roofs, high white walls, and copings bright around them
like red ruffles. Perhaps Laurs and Else stood with all the people in the public square there and sang "There is a Lovely Land", as the band played it. It was more popular with the Danes then than "King Christian". They had added a new verse to it lately, something about "Denmark shall never fall as long as there are blue waters lapping on the shores of her green islands." But in spite of all the "new" this homeland of theirs would always be old, for even before the fierce old Vikings there had been a Denmark!<span id="page-397"></span> 
Then Laurs and Else must have written Andrew and Sarah at 81 Coroly (or Corohy) road, Oxford, England (the address was in Else's notebook) to inform them that they woul be returning to Thisted in Jutland the forepart of October and to meet them there then, and, according to cousin Edythe's history, this is what Andrew and his family did:-- "Sometime in late fall we left the idyll of Oxford for the province of Thisted, Denmark - home of our paternal ancestors. The route was via the North Sea. It was only an over-night trip but, from the moment movement began in the hold of the ship until sometime after landing, I
experienced the sensation of having my head lifted from my body, then of being woosily dropped from a very high place. Again, mother, Sheldon and I took to our beds and stayed there. From the port of landing we traveled by train and ferry. The ferry boats were usually constructed with railway ties and holds sufficient to load the train intact on the boat, passengers and all, ferry it across and then release the train to speed on its way until the process was repeated again.

"We found father's parents with the relatives, as per schedule.  I don't know how much genealogy had been accumulated by Grandfather and Grandmother but all attempts to interest the relatives in the Gospel were foiled. They were adament. The "red carpet" was extended and kept bright as long as "Mormonism" was kept under cover. We were dined and plied with extra refreshments until mother finally cried "halt!" She could take no more rich pastries nor cream thickened hot chocolate (substitute for coffee), and pled for watered-down milk and plain crusts of bread.

"At last relatives and our beloved grandparents were bidden a fond adieu as father headed his little family toward Germany and school. From Copenhagen we went by water to Hamburg, then by train to the capitol, Berlin. Kaiser Wilhelm II was then in his prime. Father arranged a visit to the Berlin palace and a parade of the Kaiser's goose-stepping troops - the elite guard - in review. These fairly gleamed in their bright uniformed, white-gloved spit and polish. At the entrance of <span id="page-398"></span>  the palace we took off our shoes, tied on flannel substitutes, and were guided over polished floors that shone as mirrors, reflecting the crystal-studded chandeliers as well as the many mirrored panels that slit the hardwood or taspestry bedecked walls. (The Emperor's ambitious glory was to be short-lived however, from then on.) From here, again by train, we reached our destination - the fine old University city of Leipsig."

Possibly one of Laurs and Else's last acts before they bid a last farewell to her people and left Thisted for their home in America was to visit once more the village of Norhaa and one of the spots most dear to Else's heart. We have reason to believe that they found the dwelling where she once lived in ruins. The churchyard cemetery where her parents were buried must have been visited as well, which must have called up fondest memories of her childhood and youth, together with a feeling of deep emotion at the thoughts of never being able to visit there again. But let Else herself tell of some of her feelings then, for she put them in verse. (These verses have undoubtedly lost much in translation from the Danish but we have done the best we could.)

"O Denmark, O Denmark, thou art my Birthland<br>
Now long years have vanished since I saw your strand.<br>
Here stood father's dwelling near the lake's wooded shore<br>
But now it is gone - we shall see it no more.

"O here was our garden with mother's flower bed<br>
But I see not the rose that once bloomed so red<br>
And gone is the bench where Rudolph and I<br>
Sat and listened so oft to the nightengale's cry.

"In Old Denmark here have I yet family,<br>
Therefore I came back just for them to see<br>
And I offer a prayer on this far-away strand<br>
That someday they'll follow me to Zion's land.

"A wreath have I laid on this dear hallowed ground<br>
On this grave where my mother in death was laid down.<br>
Then farewell to all who hold her name dear,<br>
For ship's bells are calling - we shall meet no more here." 

--Else K. Christensen

* * * * *

In Thisted they secured a "Haandbog for 3 Klasse" from one P. Andersen, and then it was back to Copenhagen for them again, by train and ferry. Here they mailed a few letters of thanks back to their loved ones in Jutland and sent along a few gifts of money to the nieces who had been so helpful during their visit. Then they sailed away from Old Denmark and her green islands about mid-October 1910, on one of the big ocean liners owned by the "Scandinavian-Amerika Linie". This should have been a fine trip for Laurs and Else since neither of them ever suffered from seasickness, having been raised to the lullaby rhythm of
the sound of the sea. However, they were plagued by a shortage of money, doubtless having overspent a bit "putting on airs'' in Denmark that they could hardly afford; though it must have been well worth it to be able to impress their kinfolk there. If Else was inclined to fret about it Laurs probably smoothed things over with a shrug and some comment such as:-- "Well, better to be poor and right than to be poor and wrong", having in mind their Danish relatives utter lack of interest in the
Gospel, as well as their modest circumstances.

It took nine days to cross over and, upon docking in New York City, the two found it necessary to telegraph home for additional money with which to continue their westward journey. While they waited, uncertain about the outcome, they likely busied themselves writing cards and letters, not only to their many children but to their Danish loved ones as well to let them know of their safe arrival in the U. S. A., and probably adding a postscript about being found financially embarrassed in New York, and of course making a joke of it. But it must have been no joke to be found so. Cousin Byron Peterson remembers his mother, Emma, telling about receiving an urgent request for help from her stranded parents in New York, and of hurrying down to the Gunnison telegraph office to wire them some money. In her haste, however, Emma stumbled and fell in the<span id="page-400"></span> 
dusty street near the office and dropped the precious money she had held in her hand. When she recovered herself and the coins, a twenty dollar gold piece was missing. Bystanders, seeing her plight, helped to hunt and finally brought a sieve and sifted the dirt all around where she had fallen until they found the gold piece.

Returning to their own state the last of that October, Laurs and Else must have viewed with joy the Rocky Mountains and all the other familiar sights and sounds that said "this is home". They must have stopped off a few days to visit Chris and family in Salt Lake City, for there was so much to tell! Then they must have hurried back to Manti in time to cast their vote, for it was important to them to assist in electing representatives who would support Republican President William Howard Taft. Elvena, Albert and family would have been on hand to greet them at Manti, where they had just moved into Albert's and Jennie's lovely new home there on Depot Street (now 195 West 1st North). Previously that fall, while the new house was being finished, Vena had been taking care of three of Albert's children in Old Man Henry's rock house next door, while Jennie had been at her father, Joseph Snow's house, quarantined in with Elaine there, she having taken scarlet fever. Remembering Chris and Caroline's sad loss of that spring, Jennie and Albert had taken no chances with this dreaded disease. Albert, Judge of the Seventh Judicial District, had been staying at the hotel when he could be in Manti, but now they were all settled and together again; and Vena was happy to have her parents back so they could all get settled again too.

Letters from Denmark were awaiting Laurs and Else upon their return - it was good to know that they were fondly remembered in Thorsted:--

"Thorsted, Oct, 24, 1910

"Dear Aunt and Uncle:

"Greetings from Denmark! Then you are already now on the long journey homeward bound for your land far away. I guess it has to be like that - but we can hear from each other. Receive<span id="page-401"></span> 
my heartiest thanks for your visit - I like you! I missed you so much the first few days, I almost believe it was because of the dear little children who kept me so busy. I wonder how things are for them in Germany? And you, Dear Uncle, with your good humor which you have preserved throughout all the many years you have lived over there - yes and preserved the language too. Thanks for what you sent me. I will buy something for it that I can keep as lasting memories of those days. But I think it far too much for I was glad to be able to do a little bit for you.

"Yesterday I took a trip by bike out to Aunt Marie's. I brought greetings to her from your letter. She said she was longing so dearly to get to know when you were coming back here to live - or so she said. Oh but I get tired of her ways for so often she talks so much and it is not always wisdom that she speaks it seems to me. I believe that Aunt Else will understand what I mean. I hope you are well on the ship - I wonder how far you are right now? I know that wherever you are you have a dome-shaped sky above you.

"Dear Aunt, when I am sitting all alone, as now at this moment, so many thoughts and questions come to me. I often feel like him who said 'The good things I intend to do I do not but the evil I didn't intend to do, I do'. Yes, we are all weak people and since we can do nothing for ourselves, all is spoiled for us - everything must be given us from above. Dear relatives, we are of different outlooks on life - you miss that with us. Thanks Aunt Else for the words in your letter saying that you do not judge us. We must believe that everyone who has a faith and lives his life according to it, will find his way home to the Father's House on high, by Jesus Christ. Now dears, you must forgive me for what I have said if you find it a little strange of me. I express myself very badly and imperfect I know, but the quietness around me always calls out deep thoughts and living longings of the heart - 'Business weakens, quietness awakens.' Goodby and thanks for everything good. Hearty greetings to Elvena and loving greeting to you from your niece, Maren Skaarup."<span id="page-402"></span> 
"Thorsted, Denmark
28 Oct, 1910

"Dear Friends in the Distance:

"Thanks very much for the letter, it came in good condition. We hope that when these few words reach you that you are back in your daily routine again and safely home. Now you have a lot to think about since you have been in so many different homes recently. There are so many impressions to be received through travel. Here we are very thankful that all went so well while you were away. You asked, dear sister, how goes it with the Skaarups? It was so strange that you should ask, especially at this time during Mikkel's dark period (illness). Trouble is not something unknown to me, but I must thank the good God Father for both the light and the dark and for everything we lack. I know for certain that we do not always thrive best with wind (under good circumstances). I could just about say that the only wish I have is that Mikkel, and all of us, could be free of our ailments but we must admit that, as Paul says, 'we have a thorn in the flesh'. I hope you, dear sister, can understand my thoughts. I can truthfully say that Mikkel has been a good husband, and a good father to all of our children. But I can tell that we are getting older and we sometimes have to have things hard to get us to be humble and make us like little children for our God Father, who both can and will help us. I am so grateful at least that my leg is better.

"Day before yesterday we had the threshers here. You should have seen the bunch of grain we had. Brother Mads was here to help. I promised to send you a greeting from him and also one from Svend Poulsen. Stine is not yet completely moved to Thorsted but hopes that it will be shortly. Maren has written to you so I think I had better quit at this time. Herewith I will wish God's peace be with us all. We were so happy for your visit. I am supposed to say 'hello' to you from our children who are away. Yours, Mikkel and Karen Skaarup."

There was also a letter enclosed from<span id="page-403"></span> 
Mikkel's and Karen's son Christian, The "Marie" he refers to was his new wife. (Translation)

"Thorsted, 28 Oct, 1910
"Dear Aunt and Family:

"I feel it's my duty to protest against Marie's coverage of me concerning my inner personality because there she plainly exaggerates to a high degree. The judgment she gives is such that it is dependent upon the eyes with which it is seen and I don't believe that her sight is completely unobstructed. But I'm not so smart a doctor that I can cure her but will leave it to time who doctors all mistakes, it is said.

"I have a friend of my youth among the Mormons, Peder Christen Gertsen, do you know him? If so I would appreciate it if you would say 'hello' to him for me. He visited me here in Vesl&oslash;s some years ago. He has a brother over there, Lars
Christen Gertsen, who he said had become a free thinker, perhaps you know him also.

"I hope that our common Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, God the Father's only born son, has many mansions and also a prepared place for you with your dear husband and children. I have the impression that you are a courageous and God-devoted woman. Here on the earth there are, funny as it may seem, so many distinct parties with different beliefs, many of whom think that they alone are God's true disciples. However, the center of it all is Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and he, with his almighty grace, will have us all gathered home to himself when the great harvest day comes.

"Marie desires me to request a complete description of your travel home, and especially when you stood in America flabbergasted for want of money. Marie also suggests that I should let you know that I am really happy with her. So I will herewith add that she, my big baby - for so she is - is more interested that the work goes easy for her both in and out of the house. I wish to be a good husband for her just as she, my own big darling, also desires to be and is a good wife<span id="page-404"></span>
to me. God bless her and God bless us all! I'm supposed to send greetings to you from the Lars M. Christensens, Aunt Marie and husband, and hearty greetings from your nephew - Christian Skaarup."

So, they wouldn't talk about religion when Laurs and Else were there - but they could write about it now when there was less chance for rebuttal! Perhaps then they had set their Danish kinfolk to thinking, after all. Who then could say that no seed of truth had been sown among them there?

## PROPHECIES FULFILLED

"The Master Artist who molded the Wasatch Mountains surrounding Sanpete Valley must have loved beauty and put an extra measure of it in his work that day. He made those mountains high and strong and rugged. He remembered to garment them with blue pine forests, with groves of slim, graceful aspen and scarlet maple patches. He strung crystal ribbons of water along their arms and pinned white columbines and bluebells high upon their grassy heads. In the midst of this beauteous creation He carved out a "Bishops Chair" or a "Queens Throne". As He tapered them off near Manti He purposely left a mound of ivory stone jutting out into the valley. Many days and seasons covered the stone mound with the gray alkali dust of the valley bottom. A few scrub cedars and pine crept out of the lower canyons and stood upon the plain gray hill; because from its summit they could see the whole valley.

"One day a young Nephite came to the valley purposely to visit the small gray hill. He stood very quietly upon its crest. The hill felt the warmth and power of his magnetic person for he was a Prophet of God! His fair hair shown gold in the sunlight and his face was serene with the spirit of revelation. This Prophet, Moroni, knelt and brushed the dust from off the hill's face and withdrew a chip of white limestone. He smiled happily as he examined it. Then he bowed his head in<span id="page-405"></span> 
prayer and dedicated the hill to become a home of a sacred temple of God.

"Years passed. Seasons of eternal snows and thawing winds swept the hillside. A few more cedars came out of the deep canyons to keep watch. Only the red-men visited the gray hill. Centuries of waiting followed, but these did not darken the gray hill's memory of the Nephite prophet's visit nor of its own glorious destiny. . . And again it was November - a crisp Indian summer day. The gray hill, wide-eyed with wonder, saw in the distance a caravan of strange people approaching. White-topped wagons wormed their way across the valley and drew halt under the very foot of the plain gray hill - and here they made their camp. When all were asleep late that night the cold breath of winter came out of the west, turning the enchanting colors of autumn to withered blackness much as fire would char. Everything in the valley became covered by an ermine blanket of snow and lay cold and white - everything except the watchful green cedars on the gray hill. Next day the people went to the gray hill and dug out warm homes for the whimpering children and purple-lipped women. The happy hill felt the comfort of these pioneers within it.

"Winter waned and days began to lengthen and warm. The hill became worried and fretful for it knew that when spring came thousands of rattlesnakes would crawl from its crevices and challenge the dugout homes of the pioneers, and it was helpless to give aid. It could only hide its ugly, muddy face and bear the humiliation. Would the gray hill's promised destiny never be fulfilled then? Yet, when the dreadful day came, these men and women valiantly met the challenge of the poisonous fangs and slew the snakes by the hundreds. No one was bitten or injured. But 'ere long the redmen came to torment and kill and the pioneers found their dugout homes insufficient protection. The gray hill could help this time, for she gave the stone needed to build a strong fort that saved many lives when Chief Blackhawk was on the warpath.

"In spite of all, the pioneer colony grew and<span id="page-406"></span> 
the gray hill supplied stone for new homes for new people. But with all the new scenes and changes the hill remembered the Nephite dedication. Then it was spring again and today this memory was especially vivid. Springtime always brought new
hope. Today was April 25, 1877, and the mountain air was filled with wild flower fragrance and mating songs of the birds. A gentle night rain had washed the valley to sparkling brightness. The warm morning sun called from out the earth its verdant green carpet and spread it wide, as if to welcome a nobleman's coming; and today the gray hill felt the footsteps of another Prophet of God.

"It listened as the Prophet Brigham Young told his companion, Warren S. Snow, 'Here is the spot where the Prophet Moroni stood and dedicated this piece of land for a temple site and that is the reason why the location is made here and we can't move it from this spot; and if you and I are the only persons that come here at high noon today we will dedicate this ground'. Five days later construction began and soon the temple started to grow like an exquisite white flower from out the depths of the hill. Eleven more years the gray hill waited to see the Manti Temple finished and its delicate towers patterned against the sky. Then, at the glorious sight of it, the heart of the hill burst wide open with joy and let forth a flow of clear, pure spring water so that lawns, trees, shrubbery and flowers could be watered to thrifty growth."

The "Plain Gray Hill" referred to in Florence N. Bagnal's beautiful story was anything but plain and gray when Laurs and Else Christensen, our beloved grandparents, took up their temple work in real earnest the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century in Manti. Then Temple Hill, rich in tradition, stood green and bright and crowned with a majestic temple of God; fulfilling its sacred destiny, as the prophets of old had foretold. And here to this Hill and this Temple the aging couple went faithfully and often, as brother Joseph Hatten Carpenter, Manti Temple Recorder for some forty years tells:-- ". . . Laurs M. Christensen and his good wife, your grandparents, lived in Gunnison for many years.<span id="page-407"></span> 
When I was working in the temple they moved to Manti and spent their remaining years by coming almost daily to the temple. Your grandmother had quite a record of her kindred she labored for. Your grandfather worked considerably on my record. I hired him and paid him, as his own record was completed to the extent he had it. Your grandmother was a very intelligent woman, and was anxious that her children should have good educations. . ."

Yes indeed, Laurs and Else K. went often to the temple now. At first they walked the four or five blocks or so to and from their home there. Later they took the horse-drawn temple hack both ways. Grandmother eventually received numerous records of her ancient relatives on the Hvid line sent from Denmark by the researcher she had engaged on her last trip there. They each did all the work they could for their dead. They also solicited the help of some of their sons and daughters in this work, and even involved some of their grandchildren in doing baptisms for their dead. It was the custom for many years for Sanpete Valley
children to be allowed the privilege of going to the Manti temple, on or soon after their eighth birthdays, to have their own baptisms in the beautiful font there. Until the practice was discontinued and other places provided, Grandmother Else
took the responsibility of seeing that most of her grandchildren who lived in the area during her time had the opportunity to go there for that purpose. Pearl, the oldest grandchild, writes of this:-- "I was baptized at the age of eight years. Grandma Christensen took my two cousins, Harold Christensen and Leo Nelson and myself to the Manti temple for the occasion. Afterwards she took us up the spiral stairway into the top of the temple and told us to always remember the things we saw and heard there. I shall never forget them. Grandma also took me there several times later to be baptized for the dead." Most of the grandchildren thus favored got to climb up the winding stairway, as cousins Pearl and Harold did, and as I did, to the very tip-top of the temple's west tower, for a breathtaking view out over the valley; and a number of them were taken by<span id="page-408"></span> 
grandmother to the temple again at various times, as Pearl and I were, to be baptized for some of our Danish relatives of long ago.

Nevertheless Laurs and Else didn't bury themselves in temple work entirely but succeeded in doing some of the other things they enjoyed. Else especially loved to visit her friends - and she had a host of them. In earlier days she went by horse and buggy. Crystal Snow Witbeck remembers when "Sister Else Christensen used to stop in at Sterling on her way back and forth from Manti to Gunnison, to visit my mother, Anne Marie Nielsen Snow, and get a 'cold glass of buttermilk'. Father, Franklin Snow, would unhitch her horse and water it in the creek by which we lived and feed and care for the animal while the two dear friends chatted away in Danish, perhaps for hours. Oh the unusual experiences your grandmother could tell about the olden days in Denmark; I wish I could remember some of those stories today."

Grandmother Else not only visited all around Sanpete Valley but in Salt Lake and other places and it seemed that everywhere she went she found friends to talk to. As she progressed in years she abandoned the horse and buggy and took to the train for her visits. On one of her various visits she may have been bragging a little overmuch about her "wonderful children" and the fine marriages they had made - you know how proud mothers are sometimes, when they get to going on about their offspring, and Else K, was no exception. Well, on this particular occasion a certain sister so-and-so, whom she was visiting, being perhaps a bit jealous or at least hoping to take her friend Else "down a peg or two", finally got in her say, -- "Ja, Ja, but Vena you vil haf alvays vit you!" You see Elvena was getting on in years and not yet wed.

Some of Laurs' and Else's greatest joys in later years came from visiting their children and their families. Cousin Byron remembers that his grandparents often came from their home in Manti to visit at their home east of Gunnison. "At first they came by horse and buggy," said Byron, "and whenever we saw Grandma coming we'd go out and kill a big fat hen, for we knew she'd want to make<span id="page-409"></span> 
Danish soup and dumplings right off. Father raised pigs for the market, sometimes fifty or more at a time, and occasionally when grandpa and grandma came to our house grandma would ask if we had a 'runty pig', referring of course to a baby pig who wasn't doing very well, She prefered the ones with curly tails. Father always seemed to have a 'runty pig' when grandma paid us a visit and she just seemed to have a special talent and pride in getting runty pigs all plumped up and doing fine in scarcely no time at all. Indeed grandma certainly had a way with little pigs. One time one of these pigs got away on their way back home to Manti and grandma had a hard time getting over that 'poor little lost pig!'

"I remember driving to Manti with grandpa in a horse and buggy with a cow tied on behind. That was a long, slow trip. Another thing I remember about grandpa is how much he liked fish of all kinds, but especially smoked herring. He always ate fish the old Danish way, putting whole pieces into his mouth - bone and all. Soon the bones would come flying out either side of his
mouth, looking like 'cat's whiskers'; but sometimes they got caught in his moustache and had to be untangled. Both grandpa and grandma came to help us thin beets and later to harvest potatoes, and of course father paid them. If they came from Manti on the train they walked the mile from the station at Christenburg to our house.

"Grandma expected to be minded and usually got her way. I remember one time mother went away and left her to tend Ada and me, when we were quite young. Something we were doing bothered grandma, perhaps it was playing in the water - I don't quite recall now. Anyway she cautioned us several times not to do it and the last time with an 'or else'! But we continued to defy her until we could see she meant business. When she came toward us with that look in her eye - we ran. To our utter surprise she took after us and caught us and 'ker-plunk' her hand came down several times, where it hurt the most. I've never seen anyone run that fast, especially an old woman." Perhaps grandmother Else figured<span id="page-410"></span> 
that the gentle Emma's children needed a little discipline.

Cousin Ivy remembers that after they moved to Salt Lake City grandma and grandpa always came up for General and Semi-Annual Conferences and stayed at their place. She remembers her bedroom was next to theirs and she could never go to sleep early when they were there in October for they would lie in bed and talk about politics - always politics - until way into the night. Since grandmother was somewhat deaf in her later years, she talked quite loud then too. 

Elaine remembers that when Cullen was a wee baby he had been very fretful with eczema or something and she had taken him outside in his baby buggy to wheel him to sleep. It took a long time back and forth, back and forth. She had just gotten him fast asleep and had wheeled him into the shade and set the brake, preparatory to leaving him there to sleep for awhile, covered with mosquito netting to keep off the flies, when grandmother came walking up the path to their place. As she drew near, Elaine put her finger over her lips to indicate "be quiet". As grandmother approached the place where Cullen lay she smiled and put her finger over her lips too. Then she leaned over the buggy to look at him, saying at the same time, "Ja, ve must be quiet for he is asleep". But her words were not whispered but fairly "boomed out", and of course Cullen awakened with a frightened scream. Dear grandmother, she had no way of knowing how loud she whispered, because of her deafness.

Cousin Rose wrote of Laurs and Else:-- "Memories of my grandparents are all too few, as I was pretty young, but I do remember grandma coming to our house to quilt for us and allowing me to 'card' the wool, much to my delight. Grandpa I remember with white hair blowing and always a sweet smile and a moustache that tickled. Somehow pictures of Albert Schweitzer remind me of him. I'm sure these two lovely people were largely responsible for the many wonderful traits and beliefs that our Dad passed on to us and I am very thankful indeed to be a part of their progeny."

The Great Giver of Life was continually sending new little souls to earth to bless the lives of Laurs and Else's children during those years, but the Grim Reaper was ever close at hand also, taking away friends and relatives dear to their hearts. A chronology of births and deaths among those close to this devoted couple, during the years 1911-1914, appears thus:-- 20 May 19ll a son born to Andrew and Sarah Christensen in Leipsig, Germany, named Luther after the great Christian Reformer, Martin Luther, who began his work of reformation in that country. . . 1 Oct. 1911 a fifth son and eighth child born to Joseph and Roxie Christensen in Gunnison, Utah, but only the fifth child to live, named for Roxie's youngest brother Henry but called by the name Marvin. . . 23 Oct. 1911 a nearly twelve pound son born to Albert and Jennie Christensen in Manti and named Phillip Van Buren, for some of his mother's progenitors - his birth leaving Jennie in somewhat of a delicate condition. . . 24 Nov. 1911 Lars C. N. Myrup, missionary, Danish Emigrant of 1866, gentleman-farmer and civic leader, age 66&frac12; years, died in Centerfield, Utah, leaving numerous descendants, having had three wives. . . 18 Jan. 1912 a nine pound baby girl came earlier than expected to Arthur and Millie Christensen in Coalville, Utah, where Millie had gone for medical help from their home in Upton. . . 19 Jan. 1912 the baby girl born to Arthur and Millie, whom they had hurriedly named Mildred, died and was buried in Coalville. . . 7 Mar. 1912, a baby boy was born to Louis and Florence Christensen in Gunnison, Utah, he being their sixth child, and named Weldon D... 4 Apr. 1912, a son and eighth child was born to Christian and Caroline Christensen in Salt Lake City and later named Gordon Larsen, the second name being the maiden surname of his mother. . . 10 May 1912, a second daughter and sixth child was born to Elsie and Alma Bartholomew in Gunnison and fittingly named Ella May which was later changed to Ellamae. . . 6 Mar. 1913, John Taylor Christensen, son of Christen and Anne Jensen Christensen, died in Manti, Utah at age 41. His wife Margaret and daughters Florence and Edna survived him, twins, a boy and <span id="page-412"></span> 
a girl, having preceded him in death. . . 8 Oct. 1913 Pauline C. Andersen, age 58&frac12; years, daughter of Christen and Karen Lauritzen Christensen and Danish emigrant pioneer of 1866, died today at her home in Centerfield, being survived by her
husband, Andrew Andersen, three daughters, Annie Lenora "Nora" (Jensen), Karen Pauline "Carrie", and Mattie Isabella (Dack), several grandchildren and two brothers, Laurs M. C. Christensen of Manti and Christen Christensen of Jutland, Denmark. . . 3 Apr. 1914, Anne Jensen Christensen, widow of Christen Christensen and Danish emigrant pioneer of 1866, died at age 76 at her home in Gunnison following an illness. She is survived by one daughter, Caroline C. Jensen, three sons, Christen K., Andrew E., and Joseph Y. Christensen, two step-sons, Laurs M. C. and Christen Christensen, the latter of Denmark, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren. But in spite of it all, life went on for most of the Christensens and their loved ones, at least a little longer, and the sun continued to shine - or the rain fell.

As we recall, when Andrew B. had been preparing to go to Europe in 1910 he had sold his home in Salt Lake City to his older brother Chris. Chris had in turn sold his old home in Gunnison to his youngest brother Arthur M. These Christensen brothers and sisters were great to stick together and help each other out, In the latter part of 1915 the sister Elsie, having had somewhat of a temporary misunderstanding with her husband, felt it necessary to sell her lovely red brick home in Gunnison and move to cheaper quarters, so brother Arthur M. bought her home and returned his home, formerly owned by Chris, in on the deal.
Thus Elsie and her five children moved into the old home and Arthur, Millie and their four children occupied the red brick house. Louis D., who had purchased his parents' old home in Gunnison, was away most of the time, being employed in Wyoming
with Chris and the Bennion Livestock Company, of which Chris was general manager. Chris had a home on "The Weber" where he took his family to live in the summers, but during the winters they were mostly alone in Salt Lake City where the children could be in school. Elvena divided her<span id="page-413"></span> 
time between her sister-in-law Caroline, in Salt Lake City, her sister-in-law Florence and her sister Elsie in Gunnison, for she was still single and much sought after as an unfailing support in the homes of each and everyone of her loved ones.

Chris, always interested in the welfare of others but especially in his own family and his parents and brothers and sisters, was worried about Elsie and her children and about Louis, whose family was so far away and needed to be near him. He was also concerned about Elvena, whom he thought should be getting a husband, or at least something of her own around her. So it was about this time that he must have conceived the idea of establishing a large family-owned and operated ranch in Wyoming.

He himself had purchased 160 acres of land east of Lyman, Wyoming, a few years before, from the Bennion Livestock Company. There was a lot of acreage adjoining his property there that could be had almost for the asking. An earlier home steading act involving that part of the territory allowed any responsible person to take up to 160 acres there who would settle on the land, fence it in, cultivate it and add improvements. As a further inducement to settlers the "Grazing Homestead Act of 1916" increased the amount of land a person could homestead to 640 acres, practically saying "here is land - transform it into a farm and it is yours!" It must have seemed a great idea to Chris, as well as a solution to a number of the family problems, for some of his folks to take advantage of this opportunity to obtain land there and work together to build a successful ranch. And being a man of action, as well as vision, he must have successfully presented his plan to various of his brothers and sisters, for some of them soon filed on portions of land adjoining that which he owned twelve miles east of Lyman, Wyoming.

In January 1916 Louis took up 640 acres of land near Chris and their sister, Elsie Bartholomew, also took up 640 acres at the same time. Chris' oldest daughter Pearl filed on 320 acres of property directly adjoining her father's, about <span id="page-414"></span> 
the same time. A little later the sister Elvena took up 320 acres of land adjoining Louis' property and Andrew filed on 160 acres nearby. In fact, each piece of property adjoined that of another member of the family, making it quite a tract of land in their joint possession. Earlier Chris had named his place "The Oasis" - so the Oasis it was for all.

Previously Chris had built a nice barn on his land, with stalls for eight horses and pig pens and a chicken coop and fixed places for hay and grain stacks. Now he had a four-room frame dwelling built on the dividing line between his and his daugh-
ter Pearl's newly acquired property, with two rooms on her side and two rooms on his, with a pantry and clothes closets too. This house was completed the forepart of March 1916. In the meantime Louis was making improvements on his place, putting up
fences and having a three-room log and frame house built for his family. They were also having a two-room house and attic built on Elsie's property to house them and satisfy homesteading requirements. Sometime later a two-room log cabin with an attic was built on the sister Elvena's piece of land. A well on Chris' place, though salty, supplied water for the animals, but drinking water for the various families had to be hauled in large barrels from a spring in White Sand Hills about two miles east of The Oasis.

On 27 March 19l6 a grand exodus took place from Gunnison, Utah, involving Elsie and her three boys and two little girls and Florence and her six children, now including her second daughter, little two year old Alice Fern. Elvena must have also gone along to help with the children, though she had not yet applied for her land in Wyoming. The night before the whole crew slept at sister Emma's, for she lived within a mile of the depot, and that morning they all boarded the train and headed for Lyman, Wyoming. Louis must have come long enough to help them move and Chris and his older boys, Elmer and LeRoy, must have been on the other end of the line to see that they all got out to The Oasis safely. And since Louis' house was not yet finished, nor Elsie's either, Pearl<span id="page-415"></span> 
remembers that they all stayed for awhile at her's and her father's house, until the other two houses were ready to move into. LaFaun remembers how crowded they were and they slept on the floors and some even had beds on the table. Edith remembers
that there didn't ever seem to be food enough to go around then.

But soon those that were able were out tilling the soil and planting. Elsie tells of this in her own history:-- "The children and I worked hard clearing the sagebrush, doing some planting of crops and garden and making the necessary improvements to 'prove up' on our homestead property for two difficult summers." The Oasis raised potatoes, not only for the folks who lived there but also to help supply the needs of those employed by the Bennion Livestock Company. I understand Elsie had charge of the planting and harvesting of numerous bushels of potatoes, which netted her a little extra money.  Grandfather Christensen went up to Wyoming on occasions to help with the work there, and grandmother sometimes went up to visit. In telling of those days she once said, with tears of emotion in her eyes, ''My proud, my beautiful Else, grubbing away there - working like a hired man in the dirt!" Surely grandmother Else had forgotten how she herself had labored at similar menial tasks when she had lived in the United Order in Mayfield so many years before.

Several years before, back in Sanpete, Albert had sponsored one of his father's Danish relatives and her family, making it possible for her, her husband and two young daughters to come from Denmark to America to live. He gave the husband a job and the family a humble home on his ranch west of Gunnison. Actually Laurs and Else had been instrumental in arranging the whole thing soon after their return from Denmark. These Danish relatives, who had joined the church there, were eager to emigrate to Zion and needed help in doing so, which Albert provided. But being unused to American ways with the land, the cousin's husband, Niels Jensen, turned out to be an unprofitable farmer, though Albert gave him reasonable opportunity to learn. So Albert's<span id="page-416"></span> 
brother Joseph took the Jensen family off his hands and tried Niels Jensen out on his farm east of Gunnison. Joseph even built the Danish relatives a home there, which is still standing on the Keller Christensen farm. But Niels Jensen was also a disappointment as a farmer on Joseph's place as well, so one of the Myrup cousins gave him a job on his place. Lois Myrup Anderson writes something of this:-- "A Danish cousin of our Christensen's, and her husband Niels Jensen, lived in Hill Creek, Uinta County one summer working for Uncle Adolph Myrup. She bragged a lot about her 'wealthy family in Denmark' and showed us pictures of their big house there." The Niels Jensen family eventually ended up in California and seemed to like it
better there, These were among the few of grandfather Christensen's Danish relatives to join the Church and move to America, None of grandmother's relatives ever moved here or came even to visit, as far as we know--nor did any of them join
the church.

About a month after Louis and Elsie and their families had moved to Wyoming, Albert's wife Jennie, who had been in poor health for years, became seriously ill and was taken to Salt Lake City for special medical treatment. Some six weeks later, Thur. 27 July 1916, she passed away there and was brought back to Manti for burial. Thus Albert, busy as Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court, was left without his beloved companion and with five motherless children on his hands. Of course Laurs and Else and others of the family did all they could at the time to comfort and assist their bereaved loved ones, and Elvena immediately came into her brother's home to care for things there as best she could. Letters of condolence poured in from all over the State and numbers of newspapers commented on "Judge Christensen's great loss". Yet few could do much to assuage the grief in the home where "the light had gone out" for a time at least. Yet "Aunt Vena" was able to help so much with the children then and of this one of them, Elaine, writes:-- "I may never be able to give Aunt Vena credit for all she was to me when she came to live with us after mother's death. I remember very<span id="page-417"></span> 
little of her before that time and might have forgotten as much as I have had I not been keeping a journal while she was at our home. Although at the time, by years she numbered thirty to my fourteen, we shared secrets, activities and heart pangs. Besides providing me and my friends with home-made bread spread with thick cream and sugar for an after school snack, she also provided a sounding board for and a sympathetic understanding of my restless teen-age fancies, as evidenced by an entry in my journal, dated 14 June 1917:-- 'Today has been another beautiful June day with its deep blue sky and glowing sunset. We have completed our housecleaning today and are very glad to get it over with. After the cleaning was done, which was about 7:30 p.m., Aunt Vena and I decided to follow the railroad track until dark. We sent after some candy and nuts and crackers, which we wrapped in a bundle and started off, saying we were going to grandma's. We went west and then followed the long silver threads of tracks until we thought we had gone almost four miles; then we stopped and wished on each others bead rings which Hale had given us. We wished on our bracelets and necklaces too. I wished three things for myself and one very nice wish for Aunt Vena - that she would soon fine a nice man for a husband. After that, eating and jabbering away at each other, we followed a road which we thought would lead us into town. But the road had been flooded over and, as I had a little hole in my shoe, I got my foot wet. Finally we came to Main Street where we passed the dance hall and heard the music. I began to pity myself because I wasn't there. Aunt Vena said that we'd go home and if Daddy wasn't there we'd get cleaned up and she'd take me to the dance for a little while. My hair had been in curls since Saturday and Aunt Vena told me that it really looked awful. We fixed and fixed but it still looked like a rat's nest and it was black where I had curled it on the stove poker. So we didn't go. She told me that she would help me plan the party that we were going to have in a few days. . . June 16, 1917 (Day of the party) We've worked hard carrying benches, tables, victrola and lights for the lawn. Dear Aunt Vena has<span id="page-418"></span> 
worked so hard cooking and sewing for us, etc.'

"After mother died Aunt Vena (bowing before the perplexities of problems attendant upon caring for five young children) often dreamed of Jennie. She must have seen her in many teaching situations of all kinds, taking time out to nod encouragement
and approval of Aunt Vena, who stood humbly on the other side of the veil, seeking help. That mother adored her for her sweetness, gentleness and selflessness I have no doubt. As I look back through the eyes of experience I can now know how
tired she must have been from all of our varied demands, how lonely for love and attention from friends her own age and yet how patient, understanding and available she was for our diversified family needs. I know that she showed a great compassion for all of us and that she was especially close to little Phillip, as she must have been also to mother. Aunt Vena slept in the Blue Room with five year old Phil who clung to her as a substitute for his mother. One morning just at dawn she awoke to see Phil smiling and nodding at someone in the room. Aunt Vena turned inquiringly just in time to see a flounce of skirt disappear down the hall. Upon asking Phil who the visitor was, he replied, 'I've been talking to my mama.' That Aunt Vena herself lived close to the angels, I've never doubted."

Laurs and Else were then living a little nearer to Albert's in Manti, since they had given up their place on 1st North and 1st East and moved to a smaller place one-half block west of Main Street on what is now known as Union Street. In fact they were living directly across the street north from the Tabernacle Block that had become so important to them in their first years in Zion, some fifty years before, when the Black Hawk Indian War was in progress. They had contracted to buy this 32-ft. by 107&frac12; ft. lot and the house on it from John Lawrence and Anne J. Lowry. Doubtless they had heard of the possibility of
buying it from their long time friend and associate, Eliza R. Bartholomew, who herself had contracted to purchase the place from one Lottie Hoggan and then changed her mind after paying $100.00 down<span id="page-419"></span> 
on the bargain. Sister Bartholomew had sold her contract to the Lowrys and Laurs and Else in turn had got it from them. A warranty deed and abstract to this property were made out to Laurs, 17 Apr. 1922, indicating that by that time the place had been fully paid for and terms of the contract met. The price they had paid for it was $850 plus interest, and another $100 to Sister Bartholomew for her equity.

The house itself was a long, rather narrow two-story affair of adobe that opened almost directly onto the front sidewalk on the south. It must have previously been a little shop or store of some kind with living quarters built on behind and was first owned and built by a DeMill family. As I recall, there were two rooms in front, a bedroom, and a front room from which one descended down several steps to a large living or "sitting room" and kitchen area with a pantry. From here there was a back stairs leading up to a couple of spare bedrooms and an outside door to the west leading to a small porch. There was a cemented cellar underneath but no inside bathroom. There was little room for animals on the narrow lot, except for a few chickens and perhaps a "runty pig" or a lamb or two. There was a small raspberry patch and room for enough garden for the two of them, and they had enough primary water right in Manti City Creek to keep it watered.

This small place was about all Laurs and Else could take care of at their ages, since they were then both pressing seventy. Although they were two-and-a-half blocks farther away from the temple than before, yet they were nearer the Post Office and center of town and some nearer their son Albert's. All in all this must have proved to be a comfortable arrangement for them.
The temple hack still continued to drive around regularly to take them to their chosen work in the Manti Temple, since they were very busy there; for in 1915 Else had commenced the great redemption work for her noble Hvid progenitors, which line she had obtained back almost nine centuries, through her professional Danish researcher, to one Skjalm Hvide who had been born about 1052<span id="page-420"></span> 
in Roskilde, Copenhagen Amt, or County, Denmark. Skjalm Hvide had married the Princess Signe Haroldsen, daughter of King Harold IV of Denmark, or Harold "Hen" as he was anciently known, and his wife Margrethe. Laurs helped Else by doing the work for her male relatives, including old Skjalm Hvide. He also did work for some of the male dead of Brother Joseph Carpenter's, as has been mentioned, and for others, by which means he earned a modest living. It helped some in regards to their living when, by a Government act of March 4, 1917, Laurs became entitled to a small pension amounting to $20.00 per month payable quarterly, for his service in the Black Hawk Indian War as a "Private in Captain John H. Tuttle's Company, Utah Militia Infantry."

Laurs and Else must have started out housekeeping in their new location with mostly brand new furniture and equipment, or at least what was new to them, though some may have been second hand. Interestingly enough, an itemized bill for furniture, rugs, etc., purchased about the time of their moving, was found among their papers in the Old Brown Kit. It was from the Michigan Furniture Company, 430-36 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah and reads as follows:-- "Buffet - $35.00; Wash Stand - $2.50; Library Table - $15.00; Mirror - $5.00; 3 chairs - $9.00; 4 chairs - $14.00; Rocker - $15.00; Kitchen Table - $6.00; Refrigerator - $15.00; Rug - $70.00; Range - $35.00; Heater - $15.00; Sink - $1.50; S. H. Bed - $8.00; Couch - $12.00; 2 Dressers - $60.00; 12 yds Linoleum ($4.50 each) - $54.00; Dining Table - $40.00; Cupboard - $12.00; Oxidized Bed - $22.50; 6 x 9 Congoleum Rug - $15.00; 4&frac12; x 6 Congoleum Rug - $6.00; 4 lengths Pipe - $2.00; 2 Elbows - $1.00; 2 Collars - 20&cent;; - Total - $551,70."

In my minds eye I can see now some of this furniture and the way it was placed in that old adobe house on West Union Street. I can still see also, in memory, some of the other things that were there which helped to "dress up!" that house and make it Grandpa's and Grandma's:-- dark red plush covered, gilt edged Family Albums full of photos of strange people resting on the library<span id="page-421"></span> 
table; hand made lace tidies here and there on the backs and arms of the rockers and couch and some well-used hand-painted velvet sofa pillows that had seen better days on the seats of the same; brightly colored hand cut, hand sewn and woven rag rugs spread over the carpets to protect the spots of greatest use; a few thrifty-looking potted plants on the window sills; some heavily framed, enlarged photographs of relatives hung on the front room walls and a gay printed calendar in the kitchen and a pendulum-swinging-clock on the clock shelf ticking off the minutes and singing out in most positive tones the precise time every hour. But Grandmother wasn't much for collecting "do-dads" and folderol - she loved people more than things!

I used to go there often during the year after mother Jennie died, and I always felt welcome and so comfortable there. Though the house was right across the road from school, north, I would go around by way of the Post Office to pick up the mail in my grandparents' box and take it to them on my way home from school in the late afternoons. I usually arrived at their place soon after the temple hack had dropped them off following the afternoon session in the temple. I remember Grandpa, having pulled black sateen sleeve protectors well up over the elbows of his white starched shirt, would usually be stretched out full length on the couch in the front room, resting. He was always glad for the mail; it saved him a trip to town after a wearying day at the temple.

But most of all I remember Grandma, softly humming as she moved about fixing their late afternoon meal of cold sliced meat and cheese, bread, butter and jelly, coffee cake or sweet rolls and a hot drink. She would cease her humming to greet me with a smile and a loving kiss, saying, "Vel, vel, if here isn't our dear Weryinya!" - just as if she hadn't seen me for a time, even though I'd been there the day before and the day before that. (She always pronounced my name that way in the tender, caressing, intimate style she had of speaking to those she loved - and I loved her for it!) Then she would insist that I<span id="page-422"></span> 
stay and "have a bite" with them. This I always hungrily hoped for but tried to appear reticent about - but Grandma wouldn't be put off - and so I'd stay and pull up a chair to the dining room table in the front room where the cloth and things were set. Then she would fetch the coffee pot or the tea pot from the kitchen stove, as the case might be, and while she was filling their cups she would say in the most natural and hospitable way, "Vil you haf a cup of tea (or coffee) Weryinya?" She wouldn't wait for an answer but would quickly place a cup and saucer for me and pour in some hot water from the teakettle, put in plenty of cream and plop in a couple of sugar cubes. She even stirred it up for me. I guess this was what they called "Brigham Tea"- the only kind of tea Brigham Young approved of for the Latter-day Saints. I was never given regular coffee or tea in my grandparents' home, or my parent's either. But drinking tea and coffee was one of the very few vices Laurs and Else allowed themselves; it would have been pretty hard for them to have broken this habit of a lifetime - and they never did.

Sometimes on Saturdays I went to Grandmother's in the morning when she would be doing her "heavy cooking" for the week. The most delectable eating of my childhood came if I was fortunate enough to be there when she was making "Abelskivers", those  delicious little bell shaped tender Danish apple pancakes made with plenty of fresh eggs, a little flour, salt, buttermilk, grated apple, soda and whatnot, and fried just so in small lakes of butter in little round mold pans made just for that purpose. There was magic in the way she turned them gently over. Then she rolled them in a bed of sugar and served them up piping hot with one's favorite jelly or preserves. To me, nothing has ever tasted so "yummy" as Grandmother Else's freshly made abelskivers.

She had other kitchen specialties of course, like her Danish soup and dumplings. Her "sweet soup" and "red mush" for the makings of which she always seemed to have raspberries, red currents and a plum tree on the place, were happy changes
for one who was so used to rice pudding, sego<span id="page-423"></span> 
pudding, bread pudding, custard or blancmange for dessert. Then there was that home made Danish beer which all the adults in the family used to make such a fuss about. When each new batch of Grandmother's Danish beer had duly "ripened" and was ready for the tasting, word would go out from her place and the big folks would swarm in and have a cork-popping good time of it! Though I never learned to like that harmless Danish beer that Grandma made, I loved the happiness and hospitality of those many little family festivals we had at her and Grandpa's place when the beer was "ripe".

Grandmother Else could cook and she could sew and she could fix up her house, and these she did and did well, and she was the most charming, lovable hostess, in her unpretentious, homespun way, that one could imagine. She never apologized for the things she had or had not, but seemed grateful for all she had been given, but especially for all the choice opportunities that the Gospel and the Land of Zion afforded her and hers. If she yearned for fancy things for herself and her home we did not know it; but I doubt that she ever pined much for ornamental decorations, rich tapestries and fixtures, magnificent paintings or other works of art. Her needs were simple it seemed, and yet who knows, perhaps she too "dreamt that she dwelt in marble halls" at times. The only personal ornaments we ever saw her wear were simple amber ear-drops hanging from her pierced ears, an amber colored shell comb in her braided crown of amber colored hair, then streaked with grey, and a plain gold brooch. Indeed, the things Grandmother seemed most interested in were richness of the spirit and the culture of the soul. The things for which she seemed to strive most were the arts of living, serving, loving and learning. I often saw her studying by the lamplight at nights, bespectacled in little oval shaped eye glasses with fragile wire rims and bows. She loved to read - to study - to learn - to keep abreast of things. As they say of those who never quite grow old in spirit, "She grew a little green wood every year."

During that year of 1916/17, after mother<span id="page-424"></span> Jennie died, Aunt Vena lived with us, Albert's family, as has been stated. About the first part of July that second summer, however, she was persuaded to leave and go to Wyoming by Uncle
Chris, who seemed very anxious to get her up there for some special reason. In fact it was perhaps Chris himself who took her there on one of his various business trips back and forth from Sanpete. It turned out that he was anxious to have Vena meet a young bachelor from Upton, Utah, by the name of George T, Clark, who was one of the herders for the Bennion Livestock Co. As Chris had observed the character and habits of this man in his employ he had found him to be an all around honest, clean, good and fine fellow and was thoroughly convinced that George would make Vena a splendid husband. So Chris took Vena to stay with some of the folks and saw to it that she and George got together, doing all he could to foster a match.

It was but a few weeks before Elvena Christensen and George Thomas Clark were married, for of course Chris had built each of them up to it well beforehand. They went to the Uinta County courthouse in Evanston, Wyoming, 14 Aug, 1917 to secure their license and then sought out the LDS Bishop to perform the marriage ceremony. Each of them was thirty years old at the time but they were as thrilled and happy as a couple of teenagers.

## WYOMING INTERLUDE

The part of Western Wyoming in which some of the Christensens were now living was in the general area known as Bridger Basin, through which what was left of a once mighty river wound its way. Long ago Fort Bridger, from which the region got its name, was a precious shelter from Indian's tomahawks - the same Indians who finally whooped themselves into tame and stupid retreats on the reservations. Pioneering in this unmade country was first begun a hundred years ago by railroad workers who came to build the Union Pacific Railroad which now bisects the territory.<span id="page-425"></span>
The flapping tent villages of these railroaders were soon replaced by homesteaders cabins. Then Wyoming's vast sagebrush and grass covered prairies caught the eyes of stock raisers, and "cattle barons" with their immense herds moved in. Thousands of cattle grazed and roamed at will over the range and cattle raising became the territory's first major industry. At first most of the range cattle there were owned by non-residents who came but once a year from the east to look after their interests in Wyoming - thus the name "Cattle Barons" was given them.

Resenting the ever increasing power of the non-resident stockraisers in the business and politics of Wyoming, homesteaders began fencing in their land along the streams in order to protect themselves from ranging cattle and to break up the range. Cattlemen retaliated by having their employees file on property and, not content to fence in homesteads alone, they often included whole sections of public domain between their own property, thus gaining control of millions of acres and preventing the free use of public lands. Angry homesteaders, who would not steal from their neighbors, began to think nothing of rounding up calves belonging to some far distant "cattle baron" and applying their own brands. "Careless application of the branding irons" brought increasing financial losses and embarrassment and threatened the paradise of the cattlemen. Cattle and horse thieves flourished and rustling became a big business on the ranges of Wyoming.

Failing to pin down these "bandits of the plains" or to secure protection from them through the courts, some cattlemen felt forced to take the law into their own hands and life on the prairies of Wyoming took on the aspects of a civil war. Lynchings, shootings from ambush and other methods of frontier justice became the style as cattlemen made a strong effort to hold the range. Some hired "regulators" to kill the rustlers and frighten homesteaders from the territory. On one occasion paid professional gunmen were secretly brought into Cheyenne, Wyoming in a sealed railroad car to join in the fray; and though the<span id="page-426"></span> 
importation of hired gunmen from other States was against the constitution, yet it continued. Homesteaders were killed and their property burned. It was a bigger, bloodier war than the outside world suspected. It reached its peak in 1901. Bitterness and prejudice prevailed and popular sympathy was divided between cattlemen and homesteaders. Accounts of trouble were usually contradictory and garbled and the local authorities threw up their hands in dismay. But law abiding citizens were indignant at the flagrant disregard for law which allowed wholesale murder of guilty and innocent alike. Federal authorities were finally called in to intervene in this inter-sectional warfare between rustlers, homesteaders and cattlemen. Conviction and execution of a "regulator" in 1903 ended it to all purposes, but the rustling went on about the same.

Meantime, it had been discovered that Wyoming ranges were ideal for sheep raising. Sheep could graze the arid and semi-arid regions there and the dry, cold climate helped to produce a heavy growth of long, fine wool. So trailing sheep through Wyoming became another profitable industry. This began to annoy the cattlemen and, having failed to remove the rustlers entirely from the range, they began to concentrate on getting rid of the ever increasing herds of sheep which trailed through the country and fed on the public domain. They argued that the ranges were becoming over-stocked, but especially that cattle would not graze where sheep had been - that sheep had an offensive odor and that they ruined the range. Frank Benton stated the situation in this rhyme:--

"Sheep range - cattle sure won't graze<br>
But cowboys hate sheep anyways!"

Various practices were adopted by the cattlemen in different parts of the State to drive out the sheep owners. Cowboys stampeded whole herds of steers through flocks. Some bands were driven over cliffs. Poison was scattered on the salt-sage to kill the sheep. When attacks on the sheep failed more drastic measures were taken - herders were killed, wagons were burned and herds were scattered. For example, in 1905 Louis A.<span id="page-427"></span> 
Gantz was trailing 7,000 sheep to the Big Horn Forest Reserve for grazing. Ten masked men visited his camp, which was about 40 miles from the town of Basin. They clubbed and shot 4, 000 of his sheep, burned his wagons, killed a team of horses, destroyed $700 worth of grain, and warned his herders to leave the country and never return. This "Cattlemen's and Sheepmen's War" finally ended in 1909 and forced the recognition of the sheepmen's rights to a share of the range.

These great borderland dramas were almost at an end when Chris took over the management of the Bennion Livestock Company (1908). This was an organization owned in the main by Chris himself and John M. Cannon, also of Salt Lake City; but there were other stockholders. According to Chris' daughter Pearl, the company controlled or owned about 50,000 acres of range land and summer lambing ground on which they cared for their thousands of head of sheep, plus a few cattle and horses. An extensive ranch and summer range land in the Weber River Valley in northeastern Utah served as the company's main base of operation. The ranch itself they called "The Weber", and here they had a large two-story ranch house. Through successful irrigation methods which Chris first introduced there, he and his hired help were able to raise thousands of tons of wild or "white" hay. The Company also had rangeland in Chalk Creek Basin near the head of the Weber River and also owned property at Trout Creek and Manila and on the West Desert, where they owned two ranches and leased the school sections. They also owned a small ranch at Upton, Utah, about twenty miles over the mountain from The Weber, where many of the company's cattle and horses were cared for and hay and grain raised. Chris' brother Arthur managed and farmed this ranch for the Bennion Livestock Company for four or five years (1911-1915). He was a stockholder for a time.

The Company wintered four herds of sheep of about 2,500 each, near a place in western Wyoming called Carter, which being on the railroad was an outfitting place for sheepmen who<span id="page-428"></span> 
came there for supplies. They wintered two similar herds down at Manila where it was a little warmer and they could feed some hay. They also sent one large dry herd onto the West Desert in Skull Valley. In the spring the herds from Carter and Manila trailed to the lambing grounds at places about thirty miles southwest of Carter, called Spring Valley and at Piedmont, Wyoming. From the lambing grounds the sheep trailed on to the large shearing corral which Chris and John Cannon had built at Altmont, Wyoming. Here thousands of sheep were sheared each spring for several years. At Piedmont they also had a large dipping vat where they dipped the sheep to kill the ticks the years the sheep ticks were so bad (1915-16 and 1917-18). From the shearing corrals the sheep trailed on to their summer range on The Weber. This trailing was hard on sheep and men, sheep dogs and horses too. Chris was always on the job at those times with the buckboard and "Fannie" the mule, and "Old Bay" his faithful horse. Later he got a Ford pickup truck which made things easier for him and traveling much faster.

The Bennion Livestock Company employed quite a number of men each year, including a manager and workers on each ranch, as well as two herders with each of its many herds, plus "Camp Jacks" who were the men engaged to cook and care for the camps and horses. As mentioned, Chris' brother Arthur managed the Upton ranch for the company and his brother Louis helped with the herds. George Clark, mentioned as having married Chris's sister Elvena, was one of the dependable herders and Peter A. Jensen, who later married Chris' daughter Pearl, was assistant manager of the company as well as one of the herders. Chris' two older sons, Elmer and LeRoy, helped with the sheep or on the ranches as soon as they were old enough.

Chris often bought hay for his company in and near Lyman, Wyoming, which was a number of miles east of Carter, and he became well acquainted in the area and bought some property for the company from a Mr. C. N. Larsen about 12 miles east of Lyman, 160 acres together with

water rights for part of it, part being in alfalfa and part dry farm. About 1913 Chris, as before mentioned, had bought this 160 acres from the company as an investment. Later, with his encouragement, some of his brothers and sisters had taken up the adjoining homestead land together with a certain amount of range land that went with these homesteads, until by the middle of 1917 most of the ground still available in this area had been taken up by members of the Christensen family. On this jointly owned land, The Oasis, Chris, his daughter and his brothers and sisters envisioned a large and prosperous estate some day.

In the meantime, war clouds had gathered over Europe and by 1914 the major countries there were involved in a bloody struggle, It had been hoped that the United States could be kept free of this conflict but by April 1917 she had been swept into it. Soon two million American men were fighting with their allies in Europe and an equal number were training in this country preparatory to going over there. Thus with the coming of a bright new century with its new inventions, enterprises, and miracles, came the shadow of this new century war - "a war to end all wars" it was said. Would people never learn then?

Back in western Wyoming on The Oasis, that middle of September 1917, this war must have seemed far away. Louis, Florence and their six children were living in their three-room house there, improving their property and harvesting their crops. Elsie and her five children were living in their two-room house not far away, cleaning up their land and getting ready to harvest their potatoes. Elmer and LeRoy, or "Roy" as we shall henceforth call him, usually took turns with the herds or farming on their father's and sister Pearl's places each summer. This summer Roy was on The Oasis with Pearl, helping to harvest the hay and grain they had raised. Elvena (now Mrs, George T. Clark) was living alone in her two-room log cabin, her husband being away with the sheep most of the time. All seemed peaceful and serene there that lovely autumn, but clouds of trouble were gathering on the horizon for them<span id="page-430"></span> 
also. Following are extracts from a testimony later given by Louis:-- "I reached Lyman, Wyoming in December 1913. I remained here in the country until the spring of 1914. I was with the Bennion Livestock Company, an assistant to my brother Chris "I"
Christensen. He was then the general manager of this company. I never was a stockholder but I worked for the company every winter after I came here. I took up my land in January 1915. I moved my family here in March 1916 and moved them directly to the ranch . . . I built my first house in the spring of 1916. It was a log and frame house and it was burned down in October 1916. At that time I attached no importance to this and did not think it was a criminal act. I rebuilt the house in the spring of 1917. . . The only trouble I had had in the county up to this point was with a Mr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the oil well about 25 miles west of Carter, who shot at a herder of C. I. Christensen's and C. I. saw him about the matter.

"On September 14, 1917 I was at my ranch and my wife and children were there. On this day I was ploughing during part of the day and in the afternoon I went and hauled water from the spring and then fixed up my wagon to haul wood. I retired between nine and ten o'clock. During the night our dog barked and attracted my attention. This was between about two and three o'clock A.M. About three o'clock I heard a horse come in and up to the east side of the house and then a little later take off on the run, I remarked to my wife, "I guess Mike (our dog) is running 'Old Cap' off. (Old Cap is one of my horses.) I laid there for a few moments. I had my clock set for four o'clock and got up to see what time it was. When I went to the south room (kitchen) I saw the reflection of a light through the window and I went to the door and opened it and got the smell of fumes. I stepped out and saw a blue flame about six inches high at the edge of the roof and at the same time detected an odor that smelled like wood alcohol. I put out the fire with the water I had hauled. I found part of a torch, a piece about two inches long and an inch wide. It looked like canvas or piece of water bag<span id="page-431"></span> 
and there was charcoal there as if it had been attached to a stick and it seemed as though there was a little piece of cotton or wool about the size of my fingernail and then ashes of old rags. It had burned through the shingles and into the sheeting under the shingles for about 2&frac12; ft. wide and 3 or 4 ft. long. After daylight I discovered the horses tracks and followed them from the house and along the road clear up to Mr. White's on the way to Lyman. There sheep had come into the road and obliterated the tracks. I went at once to Bishop Rawlins and reported this attempted burning to him, and the following day I went to Evanston and talked to County Attorney Mathews. I had received a threatening letter in July but had told no one of it up to this time, I then told Bishop Rawlins about it. I returned home after my trip to Evanston and watched every night from then on but saw nothing.

"But on the night of Sept. 20th someone came again but I did not hear them, though I was up until about midnight watching. The next morning my oldest boy went out and there found, on the south side and about six feet from where the other fire had been, someone had attempted to again light a fire. I found tracks of a horse that had been standing outside. This was the same track as the first one. I followed this track up on the bench two hundred yards to where I found another track as though a horse had been standing. There was evidence of this and where it had turned around there. One horse was sharp-shod, the same as the first track, the other was shod on the front feet with old shoes. I followed the tracks up to Jenson's and then a lot of horses had come in and so obliterated the tracks that I lost them. I reported this to the sheriff by phone and also to Bishop Rawlins. The sheriff said, 'We will have to do something about this', but he did not come. Dewey Rawlins came out to watch with me and we watched all the night of the 2lst, but nothing happened.

"On the night of the 22nd Dewey and I came out of the house and we heard a signal - it was a whistle. We went out by the barn and out on the canal bank and while there we heard someone in<span id="page-432"></span> 
the potato patch between us and the house. I sent Dewey down along the south side of the potato patch and I went north along the canal. A man ran out of the northwest corner of the potato patch and I shot at him in the dark as he was running. I shot at him a second time as he was near the bank of the canal and I think I hit him, because I heard the bullet strike something. We searched along the canal that night but found no one and it began to rain very hard and was very dark. The next morning we went out and found where someone had fallen on some sagebrush. There were imprints in the mud of clothing, as though it was corduroy, and there were footprints; but on account of the rain they were so that we could not properly measure them. Tracks of two horses had come together at this point and it looked as though someone had gotten on one of the horses and ridden off. Dewey and I followed the tracks across the bench and from the creek towards Mr. White's house. We believed they were the same tracks that we had seen before. I reported this to the county sheriff's office but no one came out. But on Monday night Attorney Mathews was advised by Bishop Rawlins of the matter and he came to the ranch on Tuesday."

It was quite apparent that someone wished to make trouble for the Christensens by trying to burn them out, or at least frighten them into leaving the place. The anonymous letter received by Louis on July 14, 1917, though he had paid no attention to it at the time and destroyed it, not wanting to frighten his family, had given him three months to move out or he would be burned down. But the threatener had waited only two months to make the attempted burning. In the newspaper published at Lyman, the first article in relation to the burning was under the date of Sept. 25th, mentioning the attempted fires on the nights of 14th, 20th and 22nd of September and stating that the County Attorney and the sheriff were in Lyman on the case by the 25th. The Bridger Valley Enterprise also printed an account of the threatened burnings. But everyone in the region was talking about it and rumors flew thick and fast. Suspects were found on every hand, centering mostly on one particular crowd. A certain Mr. So-and-so was said to have made the<span id="page-433"></span> 
statement that it was "no worse for a man to be burned out than to be eaten out and by reason of Christensen eating him out he had lost about twelve hundred head of sheep". Other suspicious statements were reported, but no one could really find out the motive and as the truth was hidden and thus unknown, rumors flew to take its place.

The testimony of Uinta County Sheriff Lowhan backs up the statements Louis had made:-- "I heard of the trouble the day I was called there the first time. It was about the 25th. Christensen came in and told me about it and said someone had attempted to burn him out by throwing a wick or rags on the roof. He told me about a letter but that it had been destroyed. I did not go up until the time he was supposed to have shot someone. I met County Attorney Mathews at Lyman and went to investigate the attempted burnings. When I got west of the place the shooting was alleged to have taken place, Mathews and Christensen joined me and Christensen showed me the east and the south side of his house where burning attempts had been made. It was burned in both places and through the shingles in one. He showed me the remnants of the torch; it looked like pieces of old drawers, charred and nearly all ashes.

"The house is a three-room frame house about twenty by sixteen feet. It faces east. There is a hill behind it to the west. He showed me where he stood when he shot. He was up on the ditch bank to the west. I saw where a man had fallen on the brush and left imprints of corduroy in the mud, but the brush was broken down and I could not measure his tracks on account of the rain. It had rained all night but the tracks did show that horses had come to where the man was lying. There were two tracks came up to him and I could measure those tracks. We followed them to the road and then they went towards Lyman. They came off from the hill towards Lyman. There was no blood to be found anywhere along there to indicate that the man might have been wounded. On this trip I deputized L. D. Christensen and left him there."

It is easy to see how these threats aroused<span id="page-434"></span> 
the fear of the families living on the Oasis. If one was in danger they all were. LaFaun, then nearly sixteen, remembers taking her turn standing guard with a gun at nights. Edith, Elsie's oldest daughter, recalls how her two older brothers, A. Owen and Edgar, used to stand guard at their place at nights and how even her dear mother stood outside with a gun, taking her turn at guarding, night after night. She remembers, during those frightening times, that as soon as it was dark all the lamps would be put out and she and her younger sister Ellamae would be put to bed and told to stay there and not get up and run around under any conditions, or "the mean men would come and burn the house down" - "Firebugs" was what they called them. On the other hand, A. Owen, then a brave lad of fifteen and man of the house, now remembers that he thought the whole thing was more or less "much ado about nothing" at the time.

Thus a week went by on The Oasis and Sunday, September 30, 1917 came around. Chris, who went back and forth between the herds, the ranches and his home in Salt Lake City, was not there but Pearl and Roy were there living in Pearl's house and had been helping with the harvest. But let Pearl tell of it:-- "The harvest was over, the land cleared of alfalfa, grain, oats, wheat and lucerne seed; the potatoes had been harvested - we raised lots of potatoes for the company. Five huge stacks of hay were piled in our yard, as well as large stacks of oats, wheat and alfalfa seed waiting for the threshers. It was a quiet Sunday evening the last of September, about 8 o'clock.  Supper was over, the dishes done, and Roy and I were sitting reading. All at once I looked up to see everything so bright and said, 'Oh, what's that bright light - it looks like the sun coming up!' We rushed to the door and opened it and looking out saw everything in the yard ablaze! The stacks were on fire about 50 ft. from the house. Horses were screaming, pigs squealing and chickens clacking. We ran out and started fighting fire. I drew water from the well and Roy threw it on the barn. It seemed only minutes until Aunt Elsie's boys and Uncle Lou were there and with their help we got the four<span id="page-435"></span> 
horses out and saved the pigs and the barn, but all the crops - a whole years work - were burned to the ground. Soon some people came from Lyman; they had seen the flames from that distance. Someone went for father and he came the following
night."

We now go on with Uncle Lou's story:-- "On the 30th of September 1917 I was home with my family and Dewey Rawlins was there with me. This night we went up west of our place and then Dewey went south to circle around the south and east side of the place while I was going to the west. When I got up on the hill I saw my brother's place burning and I ran over there. Later Dewey came over and I asked him, 'What about my place?' He ran back towards my place. A little later I started back towards my house and then I heard some shots in that direction and started to run. As I was running along towards my home I came near what is called 'the Old Bedstead', on the bench, and here someone shot at me and struck me through the coat, though the bullet only grazed my skin. When I reached the house, Dewey reported to me that he had seen a man west of the house and had shot at him several times. It was now about 11 P.M. Later we  tracked two horses from my brother, C. I. Christensen's place to my place, where they separated upon the hill west of my house. Later they had joined again and we tracked them towards Lyman."

Here is the statement of Deputy Sheriff Twombly of Uinta County about his activities the same night:-- "On Sunday, 30th Sept., I went to Lyman and on out to C. I. Christensen's, while the stacks were still burning. I found tracks close to the stacks. There was one horse track that I tracked from the hill to L. D. Christensen's house and to within 40 yards of the house. It looked as though the horse was there tied and that a man got off and went down from the hill, from which, near to the Christensen house, I followed his tracks to within 50 yards of it and into the potato patch southwest of the house. It appeared as though he stopped here and then left running. He ran out of the potato patch and up towards the old bedstead that is<span id="page-436"></span> 
standing upon the hill and there he kneeled down and I could see the corduroy imprints in the place. This was where L. D. Christensen claims to have been shot at by a man who was kneeling near this bedstead. I found no shells at this point but measured the horse tracks. They came from the south side of the burned stacks, up past the west end and around the east side. There seemed to be but one track but there could also have been a horseman on the opposite side. A lane runs east and west. I followed the track from C. I.'s place in a southerly direction towards L. D.'s and then west. L. D. Christensen and Dewey Rawlins helped me and we measured the man's tracks thirty or forty times - they were the same, a cowboy boot. We watched
Christensen measure the tracks of both horses. First he measured the tracks near his home and he and Rawlins both claimed that they were the same that they had seen there before. Charley White, who lives west of Christensen's, claims that he heard his dogs bark early in the evening but did not go out to see whether anybody was passing or not."

Impressions of then five year old Ellamae are included in her present history thus:-- ". . . About this time we moved with mother to a homestead near Lyman, Wyoming, where Uncle Chris, Pearl, Uncle Lou, Uncle Andrew, and later Aunt Vena also had homesteads. To me this was quite an adventure. I was oblivious to the problems of clearing the land and making a home of stretches of sagebrush, but remember the huge bonfires of sagebrush when the land was cleared. We explored the hills during the days, free as the wind, but after dark we were afraid to venture out. I remember my brothers sitting watch with a gun, and of returning home to find rocks thrown through the window. I remember waking one night to see Uncle Chris' haystacks on fire. . . At the time I didn't know anything about range wars between the cattlemen, sheepmen and homesteaders - it was only something frightening."

Chris came the night after his crops were fired and a few others came to help guard the homes of the Christensens on The Oasis. Someone<span id="page-437"></span> 
with a gun was at each dwelling and others had set places to keep an eye out for. Each was cautioned to shoot into the air as a warning for help if anything unusual took place or anyone strange was seen in their area. There was a tenseness of foreboding in the air. Twenty-three year old Pearl and her brother Roy, nearing seventeen, were on guard at her's and their father's place on the night of Tuesday, Oct. 2nd, 1917. Chris himself, saying he was going down to one of his sister's places to see how things were there, had left going in that direction. The lights were out in the house but the door was open in order that the two inside could have a better view of the yard, though the opening was protected by a screen door. Suddenly each saw, almost simultaneously, something moving outside in the brush nearby - it looked like a man crouched down. They both sprang to the door to give a warning shot. One held the screen door open while the other prepared to shoot into the air. The action was almost automatic as they had been so carefully instructed by their father in what to do in such a case.

But then something went wrong. The motion that triggered the gun also jarred loose the screen door and it swung into the path of the bullet and banged shut, deflecting the shot to where it never had been aimed or intended, worlds without end. It all happened so rapidly and then came the startling and heart-rending cry into the night - "Oh. . . You've got me!" It was their father's voice. No one on earth had known that the time of Christian I. Christensen's probation was to be over then or that so successful a career would come to so sad an end. But though mortally wounded and in intense pain, heaven granted this exceptional man a few more days of life that he might comfort his grief-stricken children and try to make them understand that they were no more to blame than he, for he had thought they were asleep when he had returned unexpectedly and thus failed to tell them. Reason tells us that no one was to blame, except perhaps the person or persons who had perpetrated the whole thing in the first place.

His wife and family were quickly notified and<span id="page-438"></span> 
Caroline came before he passed away, 5 Oct. 1917, the day after his fiftieth birthday. His oldest son, eighteen year old Elmer, then farming on the ranch in Cedar Valley, had had a premonition that something was wrong before he got the upsetting word; for he had dreamed, or imagined, that his father came and stood in the door of his tent the night before.

They took the body to Gunnison, Utah, for burial beside his daughters, Elora and Orilla, in the family plot there. Then the bereaved Caroline and her six fatherless children, Pearl 23, Elmer 18, Roy nearing 17, Ivy near 13, Farrald 8 and Gordon
5&frac12;, went back to their home in Salt Lake City for a time. They had difficult days and decisions ahead. But always life must go on somehow for those that are left, and soon they were back again doing what they had to do, some in Wyoming and others in Salt Lake City.

Elsie's daughter, Ellamae, tells about going to Utah when her Uncle Chris died:-- 'I remember when Uncle Chris was shot; and when he died we rode with his body to Evanston, from where we went by train to Salt Lake City and on to Gunnison. In Evanston Edith and I had to go to bed in the hotel with our shoes on because we had left the button hook home." Men were left guarding at The Oasis while the occupants were all away, for even in the face of this tragedy no safety could be felt for their homes there. Sheriff Lowhan made this statement: -- "I came back to the Christensen's ranch on Oct. 4th, "after C. I. was shot and stayed there until the 9th. On this trip I remained while L. D. took his brother's body to Utah for burial. Dewey Rawlins and Rube Field were there one night watching and from the 9th to the 12th Deputy Sheriff Twombly was there."

Louis and his family, Elsie and hers, as well as Vena, returned to the ranch in Wyoming as soon as possible, for this was their home and they had no intention of abandoning the struggle to save what they had there from the evil forces that seemed determined to drive them out. Elsie of course planned to move into Lyman for the winter to put the children in school, as she had the year before,<span id="page-439"></span> 
and Florence planned to do the same. We quote again from the testimony of Louis:-- 'I moved my family away from the ranch and into Lyman on Oct. 20, 1917, but I remained there at the place and others were with me. 

"On Nov. 19th I was in Lyman and left between three and four o'clock P.M. to go over to the ranch, arriving there before dark. I put my horses in the barn and then went over to the sheep camp about a mile south and east. Elmer Christensen and Miles Critchley were at the camp. I expected to have supper there with them and then go back to the house, but they induced me to stay for the night. We went to bed but the sheep were restless and woke us up. We got up to see what was the matter and it was then that we saw that my house was on fire. This was between eleven and eleven thirty that night. We at once ran over to the place. It looked at first like only the roof on the east side was on fire, but we found that the whole house was burning and it burned to the ground. There was nothing we could do to stop it. We later found that horse tracks came in at the gate and went up to the west window. We followed this track back west again; it was what we called a 'malable shoe' and the first time I had seen a track of this kind." The sheriff was notified next morning and he came out to the ranch to investigate; his statement follows:-- "I went out again when L. D.'s place was burned and I found the track came down the road and in the mud to the northeast corner of the house and passed the north end of the house and turned west and then turned in close to the house and then went back the same way, out of the gate and up the road towards Lyman. I measured the track. It was 6 inches from toe to heel and 3&frac12; inches between heels, It was a new shoe. There was just one horse track."

Someone was responsible for these burnings at The Oasis and it was not the ghosts of past range wars. The Uinta County officials were anxious to get at the bottom of things. Judge Albert Christensen of Manti, Utah, lawyer of the family, was likewise determined to see that the<span id="page-440"></span> 
guilty parties who had caused so much misery and anxiety were found and brought before the law. He was instrumental in getting the Uinta County officials to hire the help of a private investigator or detective from the Burns Detective Agency in Salt Lake City to work with them secretly, gathering evidence and tracking down the criminals. Albert himself engaged a well known criminal lawyer of Salt Lake City to work on the case, evaluating evidence, interviewing witnesses and taking testimonies, as well as to assist in the prosecution should the case come to trial.

The report of the activities of this private detective in his efforts to track down the parties guilty of trying to burn out the Christensens in what was known as "The Uinta County, Wyoming Arson Investigation", is full of drama and intrigue, but will have to wait for a later telling. Though arrests were made, the suspects were let out on bail and the case never came before the courts, nor were there ever any convictions. While the officials tried to learn the truth, the costs mounted. Finally the investigation was completely dropped by the county officials. The general feeling among most of the area was one of anger and disgust. There was the familiar talk among them that some of the officials must have been in with the crooks; others said the reason the officials were opposed to any further investigation was that perhaps the detective got too close to some of their friends. No one really knew.

Judge A. H. Christensen hired the detective to go on with his investigation independent of the county officials. He was not anxious to have the criminals behind bars for vengeance sake but to assure that there would be no repetition of the same and that his brothers and sisters and their families could be left alone and safe to pursue their normal living at The Oasis. After several more weeks, however, reports and accounts became so contradictory and garbled and rumors so irresponsible that the detective was dismissed and the investigation closed after six months in all.

We can't help but believe that most members of the various Christensen families, if not all, were<span id="page-441"></span> 
greatly relieved to have this chapter of their lives ended. The notoriety brought on by this investigation must have been extremely distasteful to these modest people who were anything but publicity seekers. But with the end of the investigation
came the end of the dream for the great estate on The Oasis for the Christensen brothers and sisters. The dream must have begun to dim the day their oldest brother, Christian, died. It wasn't long before his family sold out their interests to Louis and left the area. Elsie and her children left before long to rejoin their husband and father in making a new home. Elvena and her husband went back to Utah to live. The girls realized little if anything from their homesteads, which were eventually sold for taxes. Andrew failed to prove up on his property there so lost it in the long run. Louis and his family were the only ones who continued to live in Wyoming. But though he continued to retain a good share of The Oasis, he went into law enforcement as a profession, being elected to the office of Uinta County Sheriff for several terms and finally being appointed to the position of State Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Wyoming's Governor, Nellie Taylor Ross, first woman governor in the United States. So The Oasis dream disappeared for the Christensens, but with the swift changing years new dreams, new hopes, new opportunities and fresh challenges took its place for all of them.

## TIME'S HOURGLASS

After the last rites and burial for their eldest
son Christian, age fifty, were ended, Laurs and
Else gathered with many of their descendants at
the red brick home in North Gunnison, then owned
by their youngest son and his wife, Arthur and
Millie. Of course Arthur and Millie and their
children, Melrose, Wesley, Grace, Gladys and
David, were all there, as were Joseph, Roxie and
their offspring, Harold, Ruth Ellen, Myron, Virgil,
Marvin and nine-months-old Don. Andrew and
Sarah had come up from the LaVerkin area in
southern Utah's Dixie with their entire family,
<span id="page-442"></span>
then including Edith, Wendell, Sheldon, Luther
and Lucile; while Albert had come from Manti,
bringing with him his five motherless children,
Virginia, Elaine, Sherman, Hale and Phillip.
Emma and Charles and their three children,
Byron, Ada and Imelda were all present. Louis
and Florence had brought all their seven with
them from Wyoming, LaFaun, Lucien, Rex,
Dale, Weldon, Alice and baby Rose, six months
old and youngest of the group. With Louis and his
family were guests from Lyman, Wyoming, Bishop
Clarence Rollins, who had spoken at the funeral,
and his daughter Ada.

Caroline and her children, Pearl, Elmer,
Roy, Ivy, Farrald and Gordon, were not in attendance 
at this Christensen family gathering, for
they had left as soon as possible after the services
to return to their home in Salt Lake City. Elsie
and her five youngsters, A. Owen, Edgar, Clifton,
Edith and Ellamae, had also left right away to
return to Wyoming, and Vena had gone back with
them since her husband George had been unable to
accompany her to Gunnison and she undoubtedly
wished to rejoin him as soon as possible.

Laurs and Else and the others were likely
disappointed at not getting them to stay for the
taking of a family group picture. But they went
ahead with the picture nevertheless, all of those
present standing out in front of the red brick house.
Laurs and Else both looked their full seventy years,
for Christian's death had been a great shock to
them. Most looked sad or thoughtful in the picture
that was taken that 12th of October 1917, but Aunt
Roxie's sweet face coming up like a full moon over
Grandfather's shoulder helped to brighten it up
some. It must have been hard to realize at the
time that it had been ten whole years since their
last family group picture had been taken. There
were a number of new faces on this one - but some
were missing, and not just because they had not
stayed to be taken.

We can imagine that part of the discussion
carried on among the adults at this gathering was
concerning their getting together oftener. Life
was so uncertain and time so precious and it

<span id="page-442a"></span>

<br><br>
Else and Laurs Chrisensen and most of their descendents
at the time of their son Christian's burial in 
Gunnison - October 1917

<span id="page-443"></span>
moved along so rapidly. In seventy years one had
only 25,000 days and 600,000 hours to use and
cherish. There was no time to waste on useless
and shoddy things, only time for the best; and
what could be better than for a family to spend it
together enjoying each other while yet there was
time in which to do it? They talked of having a
family reunion the very next summer and likely
a committee was appointed to plan it and all
pledged to be present. And then they separated,
each family going its way, doubtless with renewed
resolve at least to see their dear progenitors more
often and to keep in touch and cheer them on in
their declining years.

A month and a half later, 29 Nov. 1917,
Laurs went into the Manti Temple and did the
endowment work in behalf of his beloved son
Christian. Six days after that, 5 Dec. 1917,
Caroline and five of her living children went with
Laurs and Else to the Salt Lake Temple. Here
Caroline had her own endowments that day and
Else did the same work for the deceased Elora.
Then all of Christian's and Caroline's family, both
the living and the dead, were sealed together for
eternity, all but Pearl, and Laurs stood for
Christian while Else stood for Elora. Those on
the other side must have rejoiced on that occasion,
and those on this side of the veil who understood
rejoiced too.

Elvena (Vena) came back to her parents'
home in Manti to have her first baby. Her mother
Else took care of her. She was past thirty-one
years old and according to Tresia she had a very
hard time. The little girl was born 12 July 1918
and was given the name Vera. Vena was not yet
up and around when the Christensens began gathering 
for their family reunion, nor was she able to
join to any extent in the festivities. We do not
know if George was able to come, but probably
not as he was usually with the herds of the Bennion
Livestock Company, and with a new member in the
family to provide for felt unable to miss his work
and the income it provided.

This family reunion was quite an affair,
according to the record kept by the then nearly
<span id="page-444"></span>
sixteen year old Elaine in her journal, from which
we are fortunate to be able to copy:-- "Sat. July 19,
1918, Cousin Edith Christensen came down from
Provo to Grandmother's, for the reunion. . . Sun.
July 20, We went to the train to meet all the folks
and were disappointed to find only A. Owen. . .
Mon. July 21, was the starting of the Christensen
Family Reunion. As soon as we got breakfast
over with we all got cleaned up and Edith and Ruth
Ellen, who were staying with us, and Virginia and
I went up to Grandma's where (Oh joy!) were all of
Uncle Lou's folks, LaFaun, etc., and Mr. Rollins,
Ada Rollins, Jim Rollins, Bob Blackner, Uncle
Andrew and Aunt Sarah's family, and all the
Gunnison folks. Later there were fifty of us for
dinner at our house. Then we had a program
where Bob Blackner sang 'Sunshine of Your Smile'
and 'Somewhere a Voice is Calling'. Then the men
folks did the dishes and cleaned up the house while
LaFaun, Edith, Ruth Ellen, Lucile, Virginia and
I went jitney riding. Next we went to have some
ice cream with A. Owen, Bob and Jim. That night,
with the lights on the lawn and the Victrola going,
we had a family dancing party. But that let out
about 9:30, so LaFaun, Ada Rollins, Virginia and
I went to the dance up town for &frac12; hour. That night
we slept four in a bed... Tues. July 23, The
family went to Funk's Lake. Ruth Ellen, LaFaun,
Virginia, Ada, Jim, A. Owen, Bob and I went out
in the Ford and had two blowouts on the way. We
had a fine time at the lake, eating, catching cats
and boat riding. That night we had another dancing
party on our lawn and served punch. . . Wed. July
24, We went in the jitney to Gunnison to the Twenty-fourth 
of July patriotic program where Bob Blackner
sang 'The Flag Without a Stain' and 'Keep the Home
Fires Burning'. Then came a nap and then dinner.
After dinner the family had a meeting. It was the
grandest meeting. There were tears in everybody's
eyes. Then we went to see the races. We went to
the Twenty-fourth of July dance in Manti at night
. . . Thur. July 25, We went down to the depot to
see a group of soldiers off to war and then came
home to see the Wyoming folks off - all but A. Owen.
Sure is lonesome here."

By the first part of November that year it was
<span id="page-445"></span>
rumored that in Europe the "war to end all wars",
the worst war, the bloodiest war in history, was
almost over. Soon it was all over over there and
the boys were coming home! Cheering, flag
waving crowds, with bands playing, were at
hundreds of railroad stations throughout the
length and breadth of the United States to welcome
home their heroes. Cousin Elmer Christensen,
Christian's and Caroline's eldest son, was among
those to return from the First World War. Though
he joined the service not too long before the end of
hostilities and didn't get into the actual fighting,
he was however, as far as we can learn, the only
one of Laurs and Else's descendants to get into it
at all. How thankful they must have been when the
threat was at last ended.

* * * * *

Though Laurs and Else had kept up occasional 
correspondence with their loved ones in
Denmark ever since their return from there in
1910, this had been almost entirely disrupted
during the war and for some time after. They 
wrote again when the great war was over, and in
April 1920 received two letters from Jutland in
return; one from Else's sister Marie and one
from her sister Karen. A translation of each
follows:
"Skovlyst 21, Thisted, Denmark
26 Mar. 1920

"Dear Loved Ones:

"Thanks for the letters we received; they
are passed around among us. Mikkel and Karen
were here and Karen read the card for me while
I rested on the sofa. I have to rest my legs since
their support is not always strong. But I will say
thanks to my Father in Heaven that I can still move
about and take care of myself. I cannot stretch
my strength as far as you can but I am happy and
contented and I receive a little more to live on and
this is good as everything is so expensive.

"Our sister Stine died the 18 March (1920)
and was buried the 23 March. I believe she was
not as satisfied spiritually as could be desired,
Of course it can come to both old and young. But
<span id="page-446"></span>
now she is released from the earthly life and we
are sure she departed in the belief of the 
three-in-one God (Trinity). We have heard so little
about them since, but it was pneumonia which
took her life. She couldn't stand it with her asthma.
The doctor that came also knew she couldn't live.
It was strange that she should be so far away from
us when the end came, but all was well for her with
husband and children. New construction was being done
[in Frederikssund] last summer, and it was all good 
for them. While that was underway, they were with 
the children in Copenhagen.  

The eldest son, Holger, a carpenter and married, has
2 children, a son and a daughter, and the happy youngest 
daughter, Stinne, is married to a trolley operator, a 
solid, good man from Fyn. They have three delightful 
children, 2 boys and a girl. They were there until everything 
was finished in the Frederikssund Cooperative, of which Viggo 
is the manager and Dagmar the housekeeper. They had taken
care of all the support, and now our brother-in-law 
Svend remains alone behind.[^10]

[^10]: This passage has been revised for the digital edition.  The earlier printed  translation is misleading in two ways especially:  The original Danish letter makes no mention of Frederikshavn (in Eastern Jutland), nor of a house being built for them there, nor does it say that Stine died in Copenhagen ("where she died").  The original does mention Frederikssund (in NW Sj&aelig;lland, the main island), where son Viggo was manager of the Cooperative.  This is where Stine, and later Svend, who lived with Viggo and his sister Dagmar, died.  (Hence Marie's "so far from us.")  Only when the original letter, instead of the translation, was consulted was it possible to find out where they spent their last days.  The earlier translation also occasionally rearranges the sequence of passages, but this is not really a problem.

"Old Mrs. Vagner, born Jessen, is still
living. She has been so near death and is so feeble
but is up and around again. She had been to see
sister Stine. They lived together awhile many
years ago. I used to visit her once in a while.
She's poor now though she was an only daughter
from Lyngholm and a grocer's widow. We are
so much better off, we children of Anders Kristjan
the houseman. Yes, father did well - long live his
memory.

"Yes dear sister, you can be sure we Danish
pray and hope for our brothers and sisters of the
southland. The Germans can continue to be, as
Gruntdvig said in his talk, 'our burden.' That is
true, but we believe true and fast that everything
stands in God the Father's hands and in that belief
we live and are happy.

"Our Edel is happy. She has a daughter and
son. I am going to travel there in April and hold
Easter in Jesus' name; Thousands of Greetings.
Marie"

"Thorsted, Denmark
28 Mar. 1920
"Dear Sister:
<span id="page-447"></span>

"Right at first, many thanks for being so
kind to write to us; it is a great joy to us. I have
now read Marie's letter to you and see that she
has written about what we know of sister's sickness 
and death.

"About the first part of March Viggo and
Aksel Poulsen, who lives in Aarhus, were here
for a visit[^11] and Viggo said at the time that 'mother
is becoming better than father.' So it was a surprise 
for us when we saw Stine's death announced
in the newspaper. We decided we would not send
a letter to you until we knew something about her
last days.

[^11]: The original translation reads, without commas, "who live in Aarhus," which is understandable since singular and plural verbs (here "bor") are the same in Danish and the letters are rarely punctuated.  But we know from the previous letter and other records that Viggo was living in Frederikssund; only Aksel lived in Aarhus.

"April lst, Dear Sister:-- We have now had
a letter from Svend and that we are all happy and
thankful for. Sister was not real sick for more
than eight days. The Dr. was there on Wednesday
and he said that she would have to have someone
with her. That was taken care of and so she lay
and had it good. Dagmar was with her and lay
down in Svend's bed and they talked together for
one hour before Stine passed away, which we
have very much to be thankful for.

"Sister Marie was here for Easter and we
had it very good in spite of what disrupts both in
and out of our little land. I think that you certainly 
know the latest happenings in Copenhagen.
Yes dear sister I was better to write this time;
of course there was enough to write about. I will
with words say that all in the family have it good.
Herewith will I bid you farewell, and may God's
peace be with you all. --Karen Skaarup."

Alas, separations come and all must travel
the way of death. Though last partings are
grievous, none can escape them. There is an
earthly end to everything, both bad and good and
sooner or later every living body must lie down
to sleep the exhausted sleep of the dead for a time.
So Ane Kirstine "Stine" Andersen Poulsen had
passed on at seventy-one years five months and
six days, the first one of the Andersen brothers
and sisters from Jutland to go since Christen.
Else received a copy of some verses that had
been written and sung at the silver wedding
<span id="page-448"></span>
anniversary festival held years before in honor of
Stine and Svend. In part, they went like this:

>"Svend Poulsen, the bridegroom, came to work <br>
    on Mikkel Skaarup's farm. <br>
He came not with sword but with axe on his <br>
    shoulder and a saw in his hand. <br>
He was a fine worker and smiled a lot. <br>

> Stine Andersen, the bride, had a courageous, <br>
    loving heart <br>
And a happy, pleasant nature. <br>
These two met, but how they met and fell <br>
    in love <br>
Only they themselves know." --Yes, there had been happier days!

In Zion on 23 June that year 1920, the son
Albert married again after almost four years as
a widower. He was forty-seven and a half and his
bride was nearly thirty-five. The two, Miss
Myrtle Farnsworth a successful teacher in the
Manti High School, and Albert, chose the beautiful
St. George Temple in which to be wed. The
mothering of his five children was a great challenge
and Myrtle was worthy and capable in every way.
She took over the responsibilities as wife and
mother with optimism and great courage and
brought love and devotion, encouragement and
great strength into the home. Besides she was
an excellent seamstress, a marvelous cook and
a splendid housekeeper. Good stepmothers are
not easily found but she was one of the best.

"Aunt Myrtle", as many of us lovingly call
her, is the only one of our Christensens of the
second generation living at this writing (1969). She
will soon turn eighty-four and is still a strength
and inspiration to us all, not only her own children
and theirs, but us stepchildren and ours. There
has been no line of distinction drawn between us as
far as we can tell. Aunt Myrtle well remembers
her father and mother-in-law, Laurs and Else,
and admires them greatly, although she found Else
a little hard to get acquainted with at first. She
related this little incident about her.

One day, not long after she had taken up her
<span id="page-449"></span>
duties as housewife in the Albert Christensen
home, she was washing dishes and using a new
styled wire dish-dryer in which to dry them, considering 
this more sanitary than the old dishtowel
method besides being a real time saver. Else
came to call at that moment and stood in the kitchen
doorway watching this operation, hands on hips.
Finally she said, "Sarah has von of doze". Myrtle
replied, "Yes I know; she saw mine and liked it so
well that she got herself one right away." Else
stood looking for a while and then she stated very
positively, "Vell me, I vill alvays vipe my dishes!"
There was no "beating around the bush" with Else
K. She called a spade a spade and an axe an axe.
One always knew where she stood.

In the meantime Laurs and Else went on
with their temple work for their dead kinfolk. In
June of 1921 she was privileged to do the work for
her dear departed sister Stine in the Manti Temple.
She likely hoped to outlive her other sisters and
her brother Mads in order to be able to do the
same for them when their time came. They were
all still living the last of April 1922, when a letter
was sent to Laurs and Else from Denmark, by
Mads' youngest daughter, Edel Hvid.[^12] Following
is a translation of the same:

[^12]: Edel Petrea (b. 1889) was not the youngest.  Thora Dusina (b. 1897) would have been 25 at the time and was living with her sister Valborg Hvid S&oslash;rensen in Hurup.  She would surely have been among those who arrived in the "Hurup car" for Mads' birthday.

"Tingstrup, Thisted, Denmark
29 April 1922

"Dear Aunt and Uncle:

"Thanks for your long, dear letter which we
were all so happy to read. Aksel is going to take
a trip home in the month of June when it is Uncle
Mikkel and Aunt Karen Skaarup's golden
wedding anniversary festival. This is
a little late to send you an invitation but it would
be fine if you could come and surprise them on
this day. It is the longest day of the year (21
June) but you remember that of course - your
memory is good.

"I will tell you a little about father's birthday 
the nineteenth of last March. The day began 
with delightfully calm, mild weather and sun the
whole day. We had five guests for dinner. We
had first soup with dumplings and then ox (beef) steak
<span id="page-450"></span>
and fried chicken, potatoes, yellow
root (carrots), red cabbage, red beets, preserves,
and pudding for dessert. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon 
came the family in the Hurup car. There were
nine of them altogether so there was a big party
here. We drank chocolate and coffee. By evening
there were eighteen of us.

"The day after came our aunts, Karen and
Marie. They stayed awhile in the afternoon. By
then it had become so cold and had snowed and
frozen and it has been very cold ever since. Here
there is nothing by way of crops although we are
well along in the season. Late congratulations on
your birthday! I can remember Elvena writing to
me that it was her birthday the 27th of last month.
I hope this letter will get to you in time to let you
know of Uncle and Aunt Skaarup's wedding festival.

"Father was very sick one time during this
last winter. He had influenza and a heat rash, but
now he is completely well again. He became
seventy-seven years old, so of course he is not
wholly young any longer. We say thanks to the
good God for the time that goes. I hope you are
all well. Happy Easter! And loving greetings to
you all from Denmark and the Hvid family. --Edel
Hvid. P.S. -- I was so pleased to receive the
newspaper."

Yes, it was good that: Karen and Mikkel
could celebrate their golden wedding together; not
all were so fortunate - Stine and Svend for instance.
But of course Laurs and Else could not go to the
celebration. Their days of travel to far-off
Denmark were over. Perhaps someday others of
their descendants would want to go there. They
too had had their 50th wedding anniversary back
in April of 1916, but they had no special celebration
then. With so many of their family moving to
Wyoming about that time it probably just "got lost
in the shuffle."

The end of the year of 1922 Laurs got word
from Denmark of the death of his brother Christen
there on Nov. 27th. Now all of the family of his
youth was gone but him. It was a strange feeling
to be the last leaf left fluttering on the family tree.
<span id="page-451"></span>
How very lonely such a man must be who had no
companion or children of his own.[^13] How grateful
he was for Else and their many descendants!

[^13]: In fact Christen's wife (d. 1924) was still alive, but several of their twelve children had died young, and of those who lived to adulthood, none lived near;  two (Lydia and Daniel) had emigrated to America.  So Christen was indeed without children around him.

* * * * *

Else decided to travel and visit all of their
children. Laurs was busy helping various ones
in Gunnison with their harvests. They were always
good to look after him when Else was away. The
decision made, Else K, set out and started her
visiting in Gunnison with Emma, Charles and their
three youngsters. Then she spent a little time
there with Arthur and Millie, who now had five,
the youngest, Max, soon three years old. Joseph
and Roxie always welcomed Grandma at their place.
They still had their four youngest boys at home.
Harold and Ruth Ellen were married but both lived
in Gunnison. Else was able to get a look at four of
her great-grandsons while there, for Harold and
his wife Herma had three little boys, the youngest,
Clair, not more than ten days old, and Ruth Ellen
and her husband, Frank Hansen, had little Duane,
fourteen and a half months old.

Then Else went to Goshen where Elsie and
Elvena and their families lived. Elsie and Alma
now had six living children, three sons and three
daughters, LaPreal, now two and a half years old,
having been their first child in almost nine years.
Elvena was expecting her fourth baby and her
mother Else must have been real anxious to get
to Goshen in time for it so that she could be on
hand to help with the three little girls, Vera, Alta
and Tresia, until Vena could be up and around
again.

Else likely went from there to Salt Lake City
in time to attend some of the sessions of the
General October Conference. Heber J. Grant was
President of the Church then. She and Laurs had
lived under the administrations of Brigham Young,
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow,
Joseph F. Smith, and now Heber J. Grant, and
known and loved them all. This trip she spent
most of her time with her children and their
families however. Andrew and Sarah now had the
six children living, three boys and three girls,
<span id="page-452"></span>
like Elsie and Alma. Their Edythe had recently
returned from two years of study in Boston.

Else also spent time visiting Caroline and
her children, those who were around, while there.
Pearl, of course, she had likely seen in Goshen.
Elmer and Roy were out of the state, working.
Roy in particular was a great help to his mother
in those days in assisting with the support of the
family. Too much can not be said of the faithfulness 
of this boy in behalf of his widowed mother.
Farrald says the family would have had great
difficulty making out if it hadn't been for the financial 
assistance of this older brother during those
trying times, and in fact as long as their mother
lived. The three younger children were then at
home attending school and Caroline was able to
spend some time working in the Salt Lake Temple,
which she liked to do. Perhaps Else went through
a session with her while there, as she often did.

Wyoming was Else's next destination for she
had promised Florence she would come and do
some quilting for her. Cold weather was coming
on and Wyoming was well known for its cold
winters. Lewis and Florence were then living in
a fine home in Evanston, where he was still county
sheriff, and doing well. They now had eight living
children, baby Marjorie being two months past a
year. But they also had a grandson, since LaFaun
was married to Benjamin Slagowski and had a five
months old son Louis. Else got to see her fifth
great-grandson while in Evanston, for LaFaun
came from Lyman, where they were living, to
show him off. She and Laurs as yet had no 
great-granddaughters. She stayed several weeks in
Evanston. It was quite a long ways away and she
didn't hope to be able to get there very often in
the future.

When the first of November came Else had
had her visit out and was eager to be on her way
home. She had seen most of her descendants, as
well as numerous old friends, and she wanted to
get back to Manti in time to vote in the coming
special election. The train may have seemed to
run slowly to Else, homeward bound, for there
would be Laurs to greet and tell the news to, and
<span id="page-453"></span>
there was much of that. Albert's family also
would be in Manti to welcome her. And when she
neared the end of her journey and looked out of the
window of the Rio Grande train on which she
traveled, and saw the majestic Manti Temple on
the hill overlooking snow covered Sanpete Valley,
her heart must have welled up and almost cried
out loud, "Home Sweet Home". She had been
away so long - she was lonesome for the patient,
faithful, ever-loving Laurs!

Albert's family was mostly at home, although
Virginia was married to Daniel M. Keeler and
living in Provo, where she was expecting her first
baby in the spring. Elaine was teaching in the
High School at Manti. Albert and Jennie's three
boys were at home and he and Myrtle now had two
little ones of their own, the boy Cullen, two and a
half years old, and the baby girl, Mable Norma,
six and a half months. Else visited with them a
little while on her way from the station. She felt
better acquainted with Myrtle now than at first.
She confided in her the fact that she had had "an
axe to grind" for several years and that she had
taken care of that on this journey. Then she told
her about that Danish friend of hers, sister 
so-and-so, who had remarked to her some years before
Vena had married, "Ja, but Vena you vill haf
alvays vit you". "I vent to visit this friend on the
way home from my trip", said Else with a triumphant 
smile in her eyes, "and ven she asked about
my children, and Vena in particular and if she vas
vell, I said to her, 'Ja, ja - and Vena now has
four beautiful datters!'" Yes indeed, Else K. was
in excellent spirits when she returned from her
trip.

It was election day the day Else came back
and she went to the polls and cast her vote, and 
this turned out to be the final public act of her
earthly career. Within a week she had contracted
a cold which gradually went down into her lungs
and turned to pneumonia. She was seriously ill
for only three days. Her children were notified
and those near at hand came to do what they could.
The wife of the tailor next door, Sister Petersen,
who was a nurse as well as a very close friend
<span id="page-454"></span>
and neighbor, offered her services, and, working
under the direction of the doctor who was summoned, 
did everything she possibly could for her
desperately ill friend.

But Else K. Christensen passed away Monday
night, 19th Nov. 1923. It was a shock to all who
knew her. Sister Petersen laid her out, with the
kind assistance of other sisters of mercy. One of
their last services at the time was to wash Else's
long, heavy head of gray auburn-streaked hair,
and partially dry it and then leave it hanging down
from her head at the end of the table where she
was laid, to complete the drying before she could
be dressed in her burial clothes.

We have heard it said that sometimes spirits
hover around their dead bodies until they are
finally laid in mother earth to rest, to make sure
all goes well. Indeed stranger things have been
told. A couple of nights after Else's body had been
laid out there in her home in Manti she appeared to
Sister Petersen in a dream or visitation. She said
nothing but seemed to be disturbed and kept rubbing
the back of her neck. Sister Petersen felt strange
and puzzled about it and the next morning went next
door to the Christensen's to look at the body. Of
course she lifted the long hair hanging almost to
the floor and looked at the neck of the corpse. She
found that someone had left a damp towel rolled
between the hair and the neck, keeping things from
drying out there. Decomposition was beginning to
set in and this had to be taken care of right away.
Some may find this hard to believe but it was told
to members of the family by Sister Petersen herself.

The Manti Messenger carried an account of
Grandmother's death under the heading of "Else K.
Christensen", as follows:-- "Passing quietly away
at her home last Sunday night (Monday) Mrs. Else
Cathrine Christensen ended peacefully a 76 year
career of active service. 'Do good to those in
need' seems to have been her guiding motto, for
a careful study of her history shows her activities
to have been directed along these lines. From her
earliest childhood she has been devoted to service.

"She was born in Thisted (county) Denmark,
<span id="page-455"></span>
Feb. 9, 1847, the daughter of Andrew (Anders)
Christian and Mette Christine (Kirstine) White
(Hvid) Christensen. Early in 1865 she was baptized 
into the Church and on April 22nd of the
following year married L. M. C. Christensen.
The following month the couple left for America,
she leaving her home and family for the sake of
the Gospel. They arrived in Manti in October of
that year, having endured the hardships of the
sailing vessel on the ocean and the ox teams
across the plains. They moved to Gunnison from
Manti and then became associated with the United
Order at Mayfield, later moving back to Gunnison
where they spent many years. Later they moved
to Manti, then to Salt Lake briefly (?) then back
to Manti, which has been their home since. They
reared nine children to maturity and two foster
children; they have 54 living grandchildren and
five great-grandchildren.

"Mrs. Christensen has been a devoted
mother to her family, wife to her husband, and
ever ready to give service to her church and to
those in need. She was the first doctor nurse
Gunnison Valley had. She served in the Relief
Society both as an officer and teacher and in the
Primary Association. She was chosen at one
time as a delegate to represent the Republicans
of this county in a State convention in Salt Lake.
She has been especially devoted to the gathering
of her genealogy and has a record back to the
fifteenth century. She has made two trips back
to her native land, once alone and once with her
husband, to gather genealogy and has devoted years
of service in the temple to work for her dead relatives 
and friends. She is survived by her husband
and the following children: Andrew B., Salt Lake;
Joseph C., Arthur M. and Mrs. Emma E. Peterson, 
Gunnison; Albert H., Manti; Mrs. Elsie K.
Bartholomew and Mrs. Elvena Clark, Goshen;
Louis D., Evanston, Wyoming; and Mrs. Tresia
Lacy, adopted daughter, Exeter, California."

The account of her funeral in the Manti
Messenger was as follows:

"Impressive Services for Mrs. Christensen"
<span id="page-456"></span>
"A large group of mourners gathered at the
tabernacle last Friday to pay respects to Mrs.
L. M. C. Christensen. The services were conducted 
by Bishop's Counselor Alphonso Henrie.
The choir sang 'Come, Come Ye Saints'. Mr.
and Mrs. E. E. Johnson sang a duet. Miss
Christy Parry sang a solo, and Miss Helen Fikstad
and the choir sang 'Come Ye Disconsolate'. The
speakers were Simon Christensen, Peter Sorensen
of Ephraim, N. R. Peterson, Pres. A. E. Park
of Gunnison, and Temple Pres. L. R. Anderson."

The account of Grandmother's death, life
and burial as taken from the Gunnison Gazette at
the time is also recorded here:

"Pioneer Woman is Called to Reward

"Else K. Christensen, beloved wife of
L. M. C. Christensen, and well known throughout
Gunnison Valley and the entire county, passed to
the great beyond at her home in Manti last Monday
night at 12 o'clock. Death followed a three-day
serious illness and notwithstanding the fact that
she was very ill she was conscious and realized
that the end was near and bade all those about her
farewell. The husband, and Joseph and Albert,
sons, and a daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and
Mrs. Chas. Peterson, were at the bedside when
the end came.

"Mrs. Christensen just recently returned
from an extended visit to some of her children in
the northern part of the state and in Wyoming,
where she spent six weeks, and on her return
was well and in splendid spirits.

"The deceased was born in Denmark, Feb.
9, 1847, and had she lived until this coming February 
would have been 77 years old. When eighteen
years old she joined the L. D. S. Church and later
emigrated to America, settling first in Manti.
After a residence there for awhile she removed to
Gunnison and resided here for more than thirty
years. Some few years ago she returned to Manti
where she lived until called to the other world.
Mrs. Christensen was widely known and loved
always. In the early days she was the only trained
nurse in the entire valley, and through her charming
<span id="page-457"></span>
and loving ways and her efficiency in administering 
to the sick, she was highly esteemed and loved
by all.

"In her religious belief she was devout. For
thirty years she was an ardent worker in the Relief
Society and did much charity work. She was also
regarded as a very brilliant woman and before
coming to America, taught in the schools of her
native land. Since her residence at Manti she
has devoted her time to temple work, and her
time was occupied in this both at Manti and in
Salt Lake. Besides her husband and children she
leaves two sisters and a brother in Denmark.

"Funeral services have been arranged for
tomorrow, Friday, at one o'clock. Services will
be held at Manti and the body will be laid in its 
final resting place in the Manti Cemetery."

Yes, Grandmother Else K. Christensen was
laid to rest 23 Nov. 1923, in the Manti City Cemetery, 
almost within the shade of the magnificent
Manti Temple which stands on the crest of the
once "Gray Hill", overlooking the valley, and in
which she had labored ardently and long for so
many years for the salvation of others. Her grave
was placed on Albert's cemetery plot close to that
of his first lovely wife, Jennie. Some quite elaborate 
funeral cards, similar to ones often used in
Old Denmark on such occasions, were printed
with Else K.'s name on and sent to her close relatives 
in Denmark as a last farewell and keepsake
from her to them. (Cousin LaFaun has one of
these in her possession.)

Only a simple flat stone marker designates
the place of Else's resting. No fancy monument
marks the spot. Like the other noble mother
there beside her, her real monument is to be
found in the lives of her children and her children's
children, even to the fifth generation.

THE MONUMENT

>"I asked her once, when I was young, <br>
'Dear mother, are you great? <br>
And will there someday be a stone <br>
That will commemorate <br>
<span id="page-458"></span>
The things you've done to help the world?'<br>
My mother smiled at me, <br>
'You are my monument' she said, <br>
'And all the world will see <br>
In your kind deeds and in your life <br>
The ideals of your mother, <br>
You are my monument' said she. <br>
'I would not want another.' <br>
So now I must stand straight and tall <br>
And now I must be true <br>
To all the dreams you had for me - <br>
This monument to you."

> --Anon

There are some people who, from the moment
you become conscious of them, you care about.
Suddenly they have something to do with your life.
If they succeed - you succeed; if they have a 
failure - you fail to some degree. They wrap themselves
around your mind and heart. To me, Grandmother
Else K. was such a one! Softly she calls to me
over the years - even today. Tenuously her memory
clings. To be true to myself I have had to write of
her the things that I know and feel. One thing I feel
deeply is that in this earthly existence she gained
the approbation of an all wise and loving Heavenly
Father for her sacrifice and her faithfulness,
obedience and devotion to her Maker, and for her
great service to and her love and compassion for
his children - both the living and the dead. She
was a great soul. Sometimes I imagine I can
almost hear an echo of words coming from beyond
the veil - "Well and beautifully done, Else K.!"

* * * * *

Grandfather Laurs went on with his life and
his temple work - one couldn't just stop in the
middle of things. Just weeks following Else's
death he did the work for his brother Christen.
He was more contented in the temple than most
any place then. His children who were living near,
Emma, Joseph, Arthur, Albert and their companions 
were very considerate of him, as were
those who lived farther away. He often spent time
with them but he preferred to live mainly in his own

<span id="page-458a"></span>

<br><br>
Laurs

<span id="page-459"></span>
home and try and go on as before. But he was
lonely - there was no doubt about that! Being
naturally a rather quiet man himself, he missed
Else's humming at her work, the exuberance of
her conversation - her small talk - her soul talk;
and oh how he missed the comfort and strength of
her presence. Afterall, they had enjoyed more
than fifty-six and a half years together as man and
wife - mostly happy years in spite of hardships;
one didn't put aside a thing like that without longing.
But Laurs needed a companion - and he needed a
housekeeper.

One day in the Manti Temple he happened to
mention the latter to a widow whom he often met
and visited with there. In fact the two seemed to
be somewhat attracted to each other. Though
Laurs was half way joking about it at the time,
Sister Nielsen took him up on it right away and
practically popped the question herself (or so her
only daughter, Helga N. Larsen of Springville
seems to think it happened). Well why not?

So Laurs M. C. Christensen, widower of
seventy-seven years, and Sorena Boleta Thyrring
Nielsen, widow of nearly sixty-seven, went to the
County Court House at Manti and got a marriage
license and the same day, 21 Nov. 1924 went into
the Manti Temple and were married, for time only;
for Sorena was already sealed to her first husband
for eternity. Laurs shaved off the moustache he
had worn for many years and the new bride and
groom had their pictures taken together.

Sorena made Laurs a good housekeeper and
a splendid companion. She was of a very cheerful
nature and at times even a regular "cut-up". They
got along wonderfully together. She was extremely
attentive and good to him. She belonged to the
Scandinavian Choir there in Manti and was also
often featured on Danish programs as a singer
and entertainer. Laurs was proud of her. She,
like Laurs, loved to dance. Byron tells of going
to grandpa's house there on Union Street one day
after they were married, but it appeared that no
one was at home. Yet the house was unlocked and
he sensed that someone was there. He found
grandpa and Sorena in the basement dancing - they
<span id="page-460"></span>
were having a fine time. Sorena's son and daughter, 
by her first marriage, were pleased with
Laurs and they got along well together whenever
they had the opportunity to meet. Laurs and
Else's children welcomed Sorena with open 
arms, - "It is the best thing that could have happened to
father now", they said. She responded with love
and treated them all as her own. The grandchildren
too were showered with her attention, as evidenced
by two beautiful "star" quilt tops she pieced and
sent to me as a token of affection.

Sorena, like Laurs, had been born in Denmark
and also came to Zion for the Gospel's sake. She
and a brother came over together, leaving parents,
family and friends. Much of her research remained
to be done, as well as her temple work, and Laurs
was able to help her a great deal with these. She
helped him with his also - and with Else's. When
he had word from Denmark of Else's sister Marie's
death, 7 Mar. 1925, and again of Else's sister
Karen's passing exactly a year and eight days later,
15 Mar. 1926, Sorena went to the temple and did
the work for them when their time was right.

But time passes and people get old. The one
who never grows old, "Peter Pan", lives only in
"Never-Never Land". The long hard school of life
began to close in on Laurs. He became ill of a
diabetic condition which settled in his toes and
gradually spread. He suffered a great deal for
many months. Excerpts from his son Albert's
recollections printed in "The Hard Rich Soil", in
the form of letters mostly written to his son Sherman, 
tell much of his father's suffering in his last
days, as follows:

"16 July 1928. Grandfather Christensen is
quite ill. I'm afraid he won't be here long. He
would like to live he says, but if his time has
come he is ready to go. . . 4 Aug. 1928. Grandfather 
Christensen is very ill and I don't know how
much longer the life forces can sustain him. He is
a wonderfully fine type of man. You may well be
proud of your grandfathers. . . 18 Aug. 1928.
Grandfather is still doing very poorly and he is
quite discouraged. Grandmother Christensen is
very fine to him and we all appreciate her. She is
<span id="page-461"></span>
entitled to a great deal of credit. She never spares
herself but waits on him constantly. . . 18 Sept.
1928. Grandfather is still doing very poorly. He
cannot move about and the days and nights seem so
long. He is in pain constantly. He prays continuously 
to be released. He would like to pass away
as he feels no hope of recovery. . . 24 Sept. 1928.
Grandfather is still lingering on without getting
much better, if any at all. He is getting entirely
discouraged. It is too bad, the grand man that he
is and has been, that his last days should be so
full of pain and suffering. . . 15 Oct. 1928. Grandfather 
is still very bad, in fact getting worse all
the time, and he would like to be relieved from his
misery. He cannot get well it seems and the sooner
he can pass the better, as he feels. Of course we
are doing all possible for him. Aunt Myrtle went
down the latter part of last week and she came
back yesterday. She says grandfather is very bad
and wants to die. He may, however, linger for a
month or more. . . 6 Nov. 1928. I stayed at
Grandfather's Sunday night and yesterday until
train time. He is in very bad condition, poor
dear; he is also having a very hard time and no
chance to get well. Under the conditions it would
be a blessing if he could get relief. His mind is
as keen as lightning but his body is racked with
pain. Uncle Andrew went down to see him this 
evening and I phoned Louis at Lyman, Wyoming
this morning that father wanted him to come down.
He promised that he would."

Of course all of his children wanted to be
near him to give him the aid and comfort that they
could. Most of them came often. Even his foster
daughter, Tresia, and her husband Jim Lacy, came
to see him before he passed away. Tresia tells
about how they had written her that Grandfather 
felt that if he could only get hold of some whisky
that this might bring about a cure. It had been
used to cure so many things in the early days when
Grandmother was practicing medicine. But Utah
had prohibition at that time and no whisky could be
had there. So they brought him some whisky
smuggled in from Montana. Grandfather was so
pleased at their visit and pleased for their 
gift - and they bathed his sore-ridden foot and leg in
<span id="page-462"></span>
that, but of course to no avail. The diabetic ulcers
were in their last stages.

Albert and his family were of course then
living in Orem, Utah. We continue with extracts
from his letters to his son Sherman: "12 Nov.
1928. Grandfather Christensen passed away day
before yesterday about 1:30 o'clock P. M. and I
am here in Manti to assist in performing for him
the last earthly service we can. The funeral will
be held in the Center Ward Tabernacle here tomorrow 
at 2 o'clock P.M. He will be laid away
on the south side of Grandmother - where he has
designated. He remained conscious until the very
last. It was a marvel to all how rapid and accurate
his mental facilities worked throughout his great
pain and suffering. Although unassuming, his mind
was of a very fine order and capable of an accurate
grasp of matters of general as well as particular
concern. . . 14 Nov. 1928. Grandfather was given
a fine funeral. Many of his old friends and friends
of the family attended the services. The speaking,
singing and other music were excellent. All of his
living children were there except Louis from Lyman,
who could not come. Also many of his grandchildren
and some great-grandchildren were there. Phillip
was with me. (Aunt Myrtle and the small children
could not attend, being under quarantine still.) Ted
and Elaine were also at the funeral but Dan and
Virginia couldn't come."

In her history Laurs and Else's oldest daughter, 
Elsie Bartholomew, wrote this account:-- "Death 
brought relief to Father on 10 Nov. 1928,
nearly five years after mother's passing. He was
81 years 3 months and 19 days old when he died.
Funeral services were held in the Tabernacle or
Center Ward Chapel Tuesday afternoon 13 Nov.
1928. Many mourners from Manti, Gunnison
Valley and Mayfield attended. Speakers were
Simon Christensen, Bishop Brigham Jenson of
Centerfield, Bishop Niels R. Peterson of Manti,
and Patriarch J. Hatten Carpenter of Manti, with
closing remarks by Bishop Stott of the Manti Center
Ward, who presided. Three numbers were sung
by the choir - 'There is Sweet Rest in Heaven',
'Rock of Ages' and 'I Need Thee Every Hour'. A
<span id="page-463"></span>
violin solo 'Oh My Father' was rendered by
Chauncy L. Whitbeck; a vocal solo, 'The End of
a Perfect Day' by Mrs. Mildred Jensen, and a
vocal duet, 'The Morning', by Mr. and Mrs.
Ellis E. Johnson. President Jacobsen offered
the invocation and the benediction was by S. Peter
Peterson. He was buried beside mother in the
Manti Cemetery."

Grandfather's second wife, Sorena, continued
to live on in the home in Manti, which she inherited,
for well onto ten years longer. Then she moved to
Springville and made her home with her daughter
Helga until she passed away. The following account
of her appeared in the Provo Herald Sun. 28 Mar.
1943, under the caption, "Sorena Christenson":
"Springville - Funeral services will be conducted
in the Fourth Ward Chapel this Sunday at 3 P.M.
for Mrs. Sorena T. Nielsen Christensen, 85, who
died Thursday night at the home of a daughter,
Mrs. Helga N. Larsen, with whom she had made
her home the past four years.

"Graveside services will be conducted at
Ferron, Utah at 1 P.M. Monday and burial will
be at Ferron, under the direction of A. Y. Wheeler
and Son Mortuary. Friends may call at the Larsen
residence, 140 East Third North in Springville
before the services Sunday.

"Mrs. Christensen was born in Denmark
Feb. 1, 1858, a daughter of Marton and Nikolana
Hansen Thyrring. At an early age she and a
brother came to Utah as converts to the L. D. S.
Church. She lived at Ephraim for a number of
years and later moved to Salina. She has been an
ardent church worker, having been a Relief Society
teacher 45 years, and has also worked in the temple.

"Besides Mrs. Larsen she has a son,
Christian T. Nielsen of Ferron; also nine grandchildren 
and six great-grandchildren; a stepson,
Nick L. Nielsen of Homedale, Idaho, and two
sisters, Mrs. Eliza Nielsen and Mrs, Ella S.
Smith of California."

Laurs of course outlived all the members
of the Christensen Company who came to Zion
together in 1866, besides his brother Christen
<span id="page-464"></span>
and all of Else's people back in Denmark, except
perhaps her brother Mads Hvid, of whose death
we have no account.[^14] He also outlived all of
Christen and Anne's children, with the exception
of Caroline and "Chris Krat". Dear patient,
sincere, devout and honest Grandfather Laurs.
Like his father, his word was as good as his bond.
His principles were the highest and his ideals most
noble. He was humble - yet dignified; full of good
humor - yet sensitive and sympathetic to the
greatest degree. He was a gentleman, a loving
husband and father, and he was a loved and
respected grandfather. We shall always cherish
his memory.

[^14]: Mads died 15 Jul 1933 in Tingstrup, Thisted Landsogn, and was buried in Tilsted, where he long resided, 19 Jul 1933.

Here ends the story of Laurs and Else K.
Christensen as far as this book goes. We who
have followed them were born into a world quite
different from the one in which they lived and wove
their patterns of life. With their faith and works
they helped to build this new world for us and
future generations. It is a greater world, a more
exciting world than they were given. It is only
yesterday that our pioneer grandparents walked
the earth and did the work they chose to do. And
simply by doing well the things they did, with their
vision cast afar, they helped to provide for us and
ours greater opportunities than they themselves
had ever dreamed of. There have been more
changes since they passed away than in all other
times of written history put together. Could they
have visioned, when they sailed the seas in 1866
and walked across the plains to "Zion Land", jet
liners traversing the skies from here to Denmark
in a matter of hours? From sagebrush to cement
and steel, from covered wagon to mooncraft, from
Pony Express to Telstar - these are but a few of
the changes that have taken place since yesteryear.

Truly, we ourselves may claim no honor, no
reward, no respect, special position, recognition
or credit because of what our grandparents were
or what they wrought. We can only set eternal
goals and try to emulate the greatness of their
characters and their devotion to service, and in
so doing bring lasting honor to their names. How
<span id="page-465"></span>
we conduct ourselves is vastly important, for we
hold the future of the world in our hands. What
we do today, history will record tomorrow.

Yet each of us has so little time, as the
eternities of time are accounted. The wise wiil
charish it - the foolish waste it. For though it is
free, time is a relentless tyrant and takes its toll
in the long run. There is no time for shoddy
work - no time for non-essentials. The hourglass
of each life runs out too quickly.

>"Help me to choose, O Lord, <br>
From out the maze and multitude of things <br>
    that by me roll, <br>
One thing to keep before me as a goal. <br>
That when I die, my days may form for thee <br>
Not many fragments - but one perfect whole."

Laurs and Else K. Christensen were parents of elevent children, including two pairs of twines. One twin of each pari died soon after birth so are not counted as branches on their family tree but only as twigs. The remaining six boys and three girls in this part of the book as the Nine Branches of their Family Tree and the stories of their lives appear in the order of their births. With few exceptions these histories were written mainly by various of their children, at the request of this author. Brief accounts of each of their marriage partners are also included. Two foster daughters, partially raised by Laurs and Else, have something about them recorded here as well. None of these life histories are intended to be sophisticated biographies, for although they contain important and interesting data they are more like heartfelt, colorful, tender and even sometimes sad recollections about these whose graves we now tend and whose memories we so fondly cherish.

## CHRISTIAN "I" CHRISTENSEN

Christian, first child of Laurs and Else K,
Christensen, was born Friday 4 Oct, 1867 in
Manti, Sanpete, Utah, during the raging of the
Black Hawk Indian War there, Perhaps he first.
awakened to the war-whoops of savage redmen and
<span id="page-468"></span>
the fierce beating of warning drums, Both his
father and paternal grandfather fought in that war
with others of the hard-pressed occupants of the
then eighteen year old settlement of his birth. He
was christened just plain Christian but in early
manhood he assumed the middle initial of "I", He
was often called "Chris" or "C, I."

At the age of three-and-a-half, the war being
over, young Christian moved with his Danish emigrant
parents, a baby brother Andrew, and others
of his father's relatives, to a smaller settlement
some fifteen miles southwest of Manti, called
Gunnison. A short time after his seventh birthday
his parents joined the "United Order" and moved
five or six miles southeast of Gunnison to the very
small United Order community of North Mayfield,
taking Chris and his then three younger brothers
with them. The account of their circumstances and
experiences in the "Order" and later in South Mayfield,
have been given in some detail in another
chapter.

It was in Mayfield, we remember, that Chris
first attended school. His daughter Pearl tells of
this:-- "Christian had very little chance for an
education in school but he was taught by his mother,
at her knee, while she was spinning, carding or
doing other household duties. She, having had a
fine education, taught him so well that when he did
enter school for the first time he was placed in the
sixth grade. He studied very hard and had an
excellent memory. It was in Mayfield also that
Christian suffered the long-lasting and severe eye
infection which threatened to destroy his sight and
might have, had it not been for the constant efforts,
faith and prayers of his loving parents, grandfather
Christensen, and other concerned relatives,
Instead, however, he was left with a "happy tear"!
for life. Doubtless it was the persistence of this
eye infection that kept the boy from entering school
earlier. It was in Mayfield, too, that Christian
was baptized a member of the L. D. S. Church.
This took place on his tenth birthday and his
mother recorded it in her journal like this:--
"Christian Christensen, d&oslash;bt den 4 October 1877 i
May Field, d&oslash;bt of Henry Jensen." His younger
<span id="page-469"></span>
brother Andrew, four months past eight, was baptized
the same day, and by the same Henry Jensen,
Counselor to Bishop O. C. Olsen of Mayfield.

When Chris was going on thirteen the family
sold their home in South Mayfield and moved back
to Gunnison. His father leased a farm in Christenburg,
midway between Mayfield and Gunnison.

Here he and his boys farmed and the family lived
for a number of summers. Christian was a great
help on the farm for he had started farming young.
Pearl tells of this:-- "When Christian was about
six, he started to help his father on the farm. He
also herded a few sheep and cows on the flats in
Mayfield, Gunnison and later in Christenburg.
Many a day he skipped off with a smile, humming
the tunes he had heard his mother hum and sing to
him. He would carry a lunch tied up in a knapsack
on a stick over his shoulder. Most of the time this
lunch consisted of a slice or two of homemade bread
and a slice of bacon or salt pork; and on his way
he'd go, never complaining. He learned very early
in life the value of thrift and industry and he learned
to love and appreciate nature and the out-of-doors."

Pearl continues;-- "While living in Christenburg
the Christensen children played with the Ole
Larsen children next door, Ole Larsen and Laurs
Christensen freighted together many a time. The
children would walk or ride to Gunnison each week
to Sunday School, Primary and Religion Class.
Christian became attracted to Caroline Larsen
while living there and the two became childhood
sweethearts.

"At age fourteen Christian started working
for the man from whom they had leased their farm
in Christenburg, Julius Christensen, with his sheep
and cattle; for Mr. Christensen was a large sheep and
stock owner as well as a land owner. He soon
gave young Chris heavy responsibilities, for he
knew he was trustworthy. At age nineteen he was
put in charge of the sheep herds for his employer
and worked on shares, which gave Chris a chance
to put in so many sheep for himself each year.
This went on for several years." His brother
Albert, during some of this time, was employed
by Julius Christensen to run what was called his
<span id="page-470"></span>
"South Farm" or ranch in Christenburg. He tells
about receiving help from Chris there:-- "My
oldest brother, Chris, was my employer's foreman
over his sheep outfits, but in June when the alfalfa
was ready to cut and put up, he came down to the
ranch to help with the hay. Later he helped with
the grain which was all loaded and stacked by hand."

The year of 1888-89 Albert was given employment
with Julius Christensen's herds, under supervision
of his brother Chris. He tells something of
their experiences in "The Hard Rich Soil", from
which we quote:-- "That spring I went to work for
my old employer. I was with the sheep, a lambing
herd which lambed on the east slope of the Wasatch
Range about due east of the southernmost part of
Sanpete County. The sheep were ranged in about
the same vicinity until the first part of October 1888.
I had charge of one of the two large herds then owned
by Mr. Christensen. That fall my employer came
to me and asked me if I would continue to work for
him during the winter. He said if I would stay with
him for one year he would pay me as high a wage as
any man he had, except his foreman, Chris. That
-was $30 per month; Chris received $35 per month.

"Our long trip with the sheep was commenced
late in October. The herds moved through the
southern part of Sanpete County, across part of
Sevier County and up to Grass Valley in Piute
County, thence south past what is now known as
"Bryce Canyon" and from there down to a place
then known as "Loseyville", but now called "Tropic".
We camped a little north of Loseyville on a creek.
We had arrived at the campsite about dark. We
bedded the sheep near the trail and pitched our
camp in a sandy flat on the east bank of the stream.
Rain poured down during the night. From our
campsite, north and east, the ground gradually
rose for about half a mile and then the country
broke off into the valley. We could see the sheep
apparently feeding along this slope through the
forenoon, so we stayed in camp, drying our bedding
and clothing. The other herd had passed on ahead.
My brother Chris, foreman of that herd, was staying
with me and intended to move on the next day.

"After dinner I started out to go around the
<span id="page-471"></span>
herd, I discovered to my dismay that what had
appeared to be feed was a worthless red weed and
what held the sheep down was a plaster-of-paris
type of clay that gathered on and stuck to their feet,
When a sheep would succeed in extricating one foot
from this clay its other three feet would stick fast.
I notified my brother Chris of this condition and
together we went around the herd. We found that
a considerable number of the sheep had crossed
over into the swale, or valley, to the east. We
also found that a considerable number had moved
on to the west. They were in clay up to their sides.
We drove what sheep we could back to camp, where
the ground was more firm, then we attempted to
lift the other sheep out of the mud and place them
on firmer ground. We soon discovered that our
own feet would sink into the ground and when a
foot was pulled out the boot would remain fastened,
It was about dark when we got all of the mired sheep
back to firmer ground.

"The next day we worked the marooned sheep
over to a small hill where we had to leave them for
three or four days before we could get them back
with the rest of the herd. One of our burros got
into the clay up to her sides. We seemed unable
to get her out; so, rather than leave her in the mud
to die, we put a chain around her neck and attached
a team of horses to pull her out. To our astonishment
she came through the ordeal comparatively
unscathed. While she was useless until spring,
she later assumed her usual burdens. This was
the way we celebrated my sixteenth birthday, Dec.
13, 1888. (Chris was twenty-one)

"After the herd moved away from the mud
country we moved along leisurely. . . The winter
was quite severe. Along about February we were
forced to seek lower country. Feb. 28, 1889 was
one of the coldest nights I was ever out in. Several
sheep were frozen to death. The entire herd was
so cold that it failed to leave the bed-ground until
about noon of the following day. We moved down
into what was locally called "Death Valley". Day
after day came and went. I was up at daylight,
had breakfast, followed the sheep out onto the
range, generally came back to camp for luncheon,
<span id="page-472"></span>
then out with the sheep again. About sundown the
sheep would move slowly toward the bed-ground,
browsing as they went. Returning to camp, I would
make a fire and after I cooked supper and washed
dishes, I frequently read by campfire light. . . My
brother C. I. Christensen (Chris) was certainly a
grand brother and, I may say, a true companion to
me. He often came a long way just to stay with me
at night."

Yes, the life of a sheepherder could be a
lonely one, especially in winters, and it was not an
easy one at any time. But under this heavy responsibility 
Christian grew strong in physique as well
as character. "He was a tall, slender young man
with wavy brown hair and grey-blue eyes, but later
became heavy", says his daughter Pearl, "He was
very self reliant, with usually a happy smile for
everyone - but he could be very strict and stern
when the case demanded, though he seldom used
strong language. When he was upset with someone
his favorite term for such a one was 'chump head!'
But on the whole Chris had a wonderful way with
men - he was a real leader. He was very persuasive,
people had difficulty saying no to him. He
made friends easily. He loved people and he loved
music and he loved to sing and to dance. Some of
his favorite songs were 'Come, Come Ye Saints',
'The Star Spangled Banner', 'What Will the Robin
Do Then, Poor Thing', and some favorite piano
numbers 'Pure as Snow', 'Shepherds Dream', and
'Shepherds Evening Song'." In fact it might be said
that Chris loved life, for he had so much that was
good to give to it.

He married his childhood sweetheart, Caroline 
Larsen, 28 Dec. 1893. Pearl continues:--
"They were married in Gunnison, with a wedding
reception being held at 4 o'clock in the afternoon
at the Larsen residence. They were very happy
and cherished each other all their lives. Caroline's
father gave them two beautiful horses for a wedding
present. One was a sorrel (Old Mormon) and the
other a bay mare (Beauty). Christian and Caroline
rented their first home, the old Tony King place,
a rock house on the east side of Gunnison. They
lived there for two years while they built their own

<span id="page-473"></span>
home, which was about two blocks west of Main
Street. It was of white rock with five rooms and
was tastefully furnished and had handmade carpets
throughout. I myself, their oldest child, was a
year old when we moved into this home.

"Soon after we moved in the folks planted
shade and fruit trees, berry bushes, flowers and
a garden on the place. Since father Christian was
away so much of the time, this left a lot of responsibility 
to mother Caroline", An amusing incident
is told by their eldest son Elmer, in regard to his
father's long absences from home:-- "When I was
young, father was away most of the time with the
sheep and later, when I was at the ranch or with
the sheep myself, he wasn't there with me either.
I remember one time while I was real young and
we were still living in Gunnison, he came home
one spring after having been out on the desert all
winter. His whiskers were long and red and I
didn't know who he was. When he came over and
kissed mother I was shocked. After he left I told
her I was going to tell father that she let that man
with the red whiskers kiss her, but she only laughed.
After father came back from the barber shop with
the red whiskers all gone, of course I recognized
him and told himabout the red whiskered stranger
kissing mother - he sure got a kick out of that!"

Pearl writes: "Christian's employer, Julius
Christensen, died while still quite young, but Chris
was asked to continue working for his company until
they sold out, which left him with all the major
responsibilities for quite some time. But he was
equal to it. After the company sold out, Chris was
left with quite a few sheep of his own. Later he
bought a few more and then went into the sheep
business with Lafe Bown, also of Gunnison. This
partnership lasted for many years and was most
successful.

"Lafe and Christian ran their sheep up
Twelve Mile canyon in summers and on the west
desert in winters, Their company owned a separating 
corral south of Fayette, where they
separated their sheep both spring and fall.
Christian spent many a cold, hard winter going
back and forth on the west desert with the sheep.
<span id="page-474"></span>
He usually traveled in his buckboard. He would
put hot rocks in the bottom of it to keep his feet
warm and usually he had heavy wool-filled quilts
around him to keep out the cold. Many times he
would drive all night to keep a promised appointment.
Sometimes he would have to camp by a fire
or under a cedar tree until it was light enough to
find his way. There was little travel on the desert
in winter and the going was slow, A trip that would
take eight to ten days at that time in a wagon or
buckboard can now be made in four or five hours
in a car and forty-five minutes by plane.

"Christian and Lafe Bown had dependable
men that would help them with the sheep, which
left them free for their other interests when
necessary. Christian's two younger brothers,
Louis and Arthur, worked for him a lot. Besides
his sheep and cattle he had a farm on the west side
of Gunnison at a place called Clarion. There was
always a job to be done there and elsewhere, with
harvesting of crops, threshing, getting flour,
potatoes and meat in for the winter, and also wood.
Besides his own wood supply he hauled extra for
needy families and widows, He paid his tithing
with such farm products as grain, hay, wheat,
flour or cattle.

"The winters with him away seemed long but
the summers were wonderful. Father and our
family, Lafe Bown and his family, and other friends
and relatives spent many happy summers up Twelve
Mile Canyon together. We went riding, hiking,
picking wild flowers and berries. We made swings
for grown ups and for children and we made large
bonfires to gather 'round in evenings for fun, with
singing and dancing. A favorite hike was up
Musinia Peak by foot or horseback. Good old sour
dough bread and plenty of mutton chops cooked over
the open fire or on a camp stove was the food we
liked best."

The sheep business paid off for Chris in
those days and he was able to save quite a bit of
money. Among other things, he was most generous
in helping his brothers and sisters get the schooling
which he himself had been denied, He was indeed
an older brother to be honored and looked up to in
<span id="page-475"></span>
every sense of the word. Again we quote from his
brother Albert's recollections:-- "The four older
children of my parents were boys. The oldest was
Christian (or Chris or C. I.) then Andrew, Joseph
and myself. In the early days, in Mayfield especially,
we often roamed the foothills and fields
together. Chris generally took the responsibility
of my supervision on such occasions. In later
years we four were passed off as 'oldest' and
'youngest' and 'middle two', I generally looked to
Chris as my 'big brother' and a real big brother
he was. . , I remember well when I was struggling
to get an education. Very frequently there was a
shortage of spending money. At one of these
critical times my oldest brother (Chris) came to
my aid, and that without asking. . . While I was
attending Law School at Ann Arbor, Michigan, my
finances were again very limited. I sold some of
the things I had at Gunnison, including my rubbertired 
buggy and some other articles of which I now
have little memory. In the autumn of 1898, when
I was about at the point of seeking some help to
tide me over my last year, I received a letter
from my oldest brother, Chris, or C. I. Christensen,
as he then signed his name. This letter has
always seemed to me to be somewhat of a miracle,
It read, in substance:-- 'Dear Albert, I have just
sold a herd of sheep and I am wondering if you
won't need some help to see you through school.
If you will let me know about how much you will
need a month I will be glad to send it to you.'

"No one will ever know how grateful I felt
for this message. As a child Chris had always
been my ideal and almost my guardian. Now he
was turning out to be my savior, materially, as
well. Needless to say, I accepted his offer with
heartfelt thanks. Thereafter, the needed checks
came regularly, Just before graduation he sent a
larger check to take care of my graduation and my
trip home. . . Upon returning home I figured I
owed the Manti City Savings Bank a total of $700
and interest. My brother Chris had told me while
I was at school that he would look after the interest
on my note, but I wanted to make such further
arrangements as might be necessary. I went to
the bank and requested the cashier to look up the
<span id="page-476"></span>
condition of my account and told him that I would
like to get an extension. He left and in a minute
he came back and said, 'You have no loan here; it
was paid in full by Chris about a year ago.'. .
When I went back to Gunnison a few days later, I
called in to thank my brother for what he had done
for me and to give him my note. He told me to
forget it. When I told him I couldn't do that, he
finally insisted that he would accept nothing more
than the principal. 'You can take what time you
want to pay that', he added. I shall be in Chris'
debt forever."

That's the kind of fellow Christian "I" Christensen
was, and others of his brothers and sisters
could have told similar stories about his kindness
and helpfulness to them. While a number of these
were struggling to get their college educations at
B. Y. U. in the early nineties, Chris came to their
aid time and time again. His daughter Pearl says:
"Christian saved enough money to help his three
brothers and one sister through school at Provo.
I have been told that at one time he had saved two
hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces and he used what
was needed of it to help with their educations and
also buy new graduation outfits and pay for having
their pictures taken." More has been given about
this in an earlier chapter but too much cannot be
said about the generosity and charity of this wonderful brother.

We continue from Pearl's history:-- "Christian,
a strong Republican leader in Gunnison, was active
in politics there. He was City Recorder at one
time and City Treasurer, and was on the Gunnison
School Board of Education for a period of eight
years, from 1900 to 1908. He always used to see
that everyone had a chance to vote at elections,
and helped by picking up in his buggy those who
might not otherwise have ways to get to the polls,
especially the widows.

"The 4th and 24th of July were great days for
celebration in Gunnison, Christian liked to see
that all the children rode in the parade on a big
flat-topped wagon; he called them 'Utah's Best
Crop'. He loved to see everybody having a good
time. His little girls were dressed in white silk
<span id="page-477"></span>
dresses and his little boys in blue pants and blue
and white striped shirts, which their mother
Caroline made for them. She took pride in sewing
for her children. One year Christian was 'Marshal
of the Day' for one of these big celebrations. He
wore a large black Stetson hat with a long ostrich
plume which hung down over his shoulder and he
rode a black, shiney horse with its mane and tail
braided with blue ribbons. We all called the horse
'Old Black Joe',

"Christmas was another great holiday for
our family and both father and mother enjoyed
having their children and their relatives and friends
around them to help celebrate. Some of the many
good features were the wonderful dinners mother
cooked and served at those times, as well as on
other special occasions such as L. D. S. Conference 
times when we usually had visitors at our
house, especially after we moved to Salt Lake
City."

In 1908 Chris dissolved his partnership with
Lafe Bown and joined with John M. Cannon of Salt
Lake City, and other smaller stockholders, in
what became known as the "Bennion Livestock
Company". As has been mentioned earlier, this
company's main headquarters was a large ranch
on the headwaters of the Weber River in northeastern 
Utah, which they called "The Weber",
together with other smaller ranches and accompanying 
range lands in the areas. Chris trailed
his sheep and other livestock from Twelve Mile
in Sanpete County to The Weber, and his brothers
Albert and Arthur had some of their sheep trailed
up there also, as they became smaller stockholders
in this venture. Arthur's brother-in-law, Bert
Gledhill, writes something of this:-- "Arthur, after
his marriage, was associated with his brother,
Albert Christensen, in the sheep business. They
lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina.
After lambing, about July lst, they would move
into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer months
and then winter on the west desert. As I remember,
Arthur and his brother Louis took care of the sheep
on the desert until the later years. I was herding
with Louis on Cedar Mt. one summer when we got
<span id="page-478"></span>
word to take 1500 head of sheep and start for the
Weber River area above Oakley, Utah. Arthur
met us above Gunnison and was in charge from
there. That was the start of the Bennion Livestock
Company in which Arthur, Albert and Chris became 
interested. The following year the company
bought a ranch at Upton, on Huff Creek, from a
Mr. Benson, and Arthur was made foreman of that
ranch. The company herders came there for
supplies, which were hauled twelve miles by team
from Coalville. I lived with Arthur and Millie for
a time and worked on that ranch."

Chris was up on The Weber in May 1910
when he received word of the serious illness of
two of his young daughters. Pearl tells of their
deaths:-- "In 1910 scarlet fever hit the town of
Gunnison and nearly all the children got it. Elora
and Orilla took the terrible fever and both died of
it within five days of each other. There wasn't
much help for them in those days. Father did not
get home before Orilla died but he came a few hours
before Elora did. She spoke to him and asked him
not to be 'Woodman', meaning a member of the
Woodmen of the World Lodge. This request he
kept. (She also, in her young and innocent way,
asked him to take her mother and the children to
the Manti Temple and have them all sealed to him
as a family, for eternity. This he also promised
and was most sincere in it but, like so many, put
it off for awhile for more pressing things and never
seemed to get around to it.) The funeral services
were held on the front lawn of the home. The
girls' caskets were raised so that everyone could
see how pretty they were, with Elora's golden
brown hair which covered her like a cape to her
knees and Orilla's reddish-golden curls. Their
deaths were such sorrows to our family.

"Later on that summer father sold most of
his interests in Gunnison, including our home
which he sold to his brother Arthur, and bought
his brother Andrew's home on 9th East and 27th
South in Salt Lake City. (This home has been so
well described by Andrew's daughter Edyth in
other chapters of this book.) It was hard on our
family at first to move from the country into a big

<span id="page-478a"></span>

The lovely home in Salt Lake City about the time Chris (I) Christensen purchased it from his brother Andrew in 1910. Pearl, Ivy, Caroline and Roy grouped in front.

<span id="page-479"></span>
city among strangers. But since all the members
were very active in the Church at the time, all
except father, it didn't take long before we had
made many new friends in the Forest Dale Ward
into which we had moved, Mother took part in
Relief Society and other church functions, Whenever
father was at home he always attended meetings
with us, though he was never home long
enough to fill a position of responsibility. He
held the priesthood and was always a faithful
supporter of the L. D. S. Church, in spite of the
fact that his business and interests required that
he spend most of his time, especially his winters
and springs, away from the centers of civilization
and his family.

"He had replaced his buckboard with a Ford
pickup truck, which made things easier for him
and traveling faster. He traveled so many times
in the night to be able to keep his appointments.
When he could he took the train to Wyoming and
often stayed overnight at the hotel in Carter, trying
to get himself cleaned up a little from the grime
of travel, or, as he said, 'taking a bath in a tea
cup.' He spent many days and nights in the terrible
cold of Wyoming's winters. The Carter range was
below zero most of the time then."

But summers were different as far as being
with his family was concerned. Pearl writes of
this:-- "For many years, after we moved to Salt
Lake, our family spent most of the summers on
the ranch owned by the Bennion Livestock Company,
called 'The Weber'. We would move there as soon
as school was out in the spring and stay until late
fall, except for a trip or two back to Salt Lake to
check on the family home and get supplies for ourselves
and the hired men, as well as grain for the
horses. One of the highlights of these trips back
and forth, especially for father, was to stop at the
creamery located in the little town of Oakland.
Father was extremely fond of buttermilk and was
always sure of getting all he could drink of that
refreshing beverage whenever he stopped there.
It has been stated that his capacity for buttermilk
was remarkable.

"On the ranch in summers there was always
<span id="page-480"></span>
plenty of work to be done. Ranch work however
was interesting to us children and father seemed
to enjoy having us help with such things as separating
sheep in the pens and getting lambs ready to
trail to market. When it was sheep shearing time
at the various shearing corrals, we loved to go
along and play on the giant wool sacks. We looked
forward to going with father to the many sheep
camps scattered throughout the area, for this
meant horseback rides through the mountains.
The Company owned a small ranch and lambing
ground in Chalk Creek Basin east of Coalville and
up over the mountain directly north of The Weber.
Trips were made there to get horses, etc., and
trips were taken to the company ranch at Upton,
which was also east of Coalville and where they
raised hay and grain and made butter and had a
place to feed the company's horses.

"But if this was called 'work' there was
plenty of time left for fun too. A short distance
from the two-story-ranch-house was a small lake
called 'Commisary Lake'. Because this lake had
no outlet its waters became quite warm in summertime
and thus it became a favorite swimming hole
for the entire family. This was fun. It was fun
too for the whole family to spend time picking the
delicious wild raspberries that abounded in the
nearby areas, and make a picnic of it."

Christian purchased a part of the ranch known
as "The Oasis" near Lyman, Wyoming, as we have
heard, and about the same time he bought a dry
farm in Cedar Valley, west of Lehi, Utah and a
fruit farm at LaVerkin, Utah, in the Dixie country,
which his brother Andrew had interested him in.
It appeared quite evident that he had great hopes
for the future and that things ahead looked bright
for him indeed.

Pearl telis that her father never liked to use
the word "goodbye". It was always just "see you
later" or "so long". As he left his home in Salt
Lake City that last time in late September of 1917,
he didn't say "see you later" but simply "so long".
In fact, as he left that last time, he returned from
the front gate to the front door three times to say
"so long" to his beloved wife, Caroline. That was
<span id="page-481"></span>
the last time she saw him until she stood by his
deathbed at The Oasis in Wyoming the first part
of October. The circumstances of Christian's
accident and death have been covered in a previous
chapter but we should like to present his daughter
Pearl's courageous and moving account of those
also:--

"Father was shot the night of Oct. 2nd 1917,
at the ranch, and died there Oct. 5th. He was to
have gone up in another direction, but he did not
go and of course we didn't know this. He had cautioned
Roy and me to shoot for help if we saw anything
moving in the area. I feel that I was at fault
as much as Roy, although he held the gun, for just
as he fired in the air from the doorway the screen
door I was trying to hold open for him flew shut on
the gun, putting the shot onto father. Of course
we didn't know at the time that it was father. All
we knew was that we could see someone moving in
our yard, that we had been told to shoot for help
in such a case, and that we were frightened. I
guess this was just supposed to be - just one of
those things. This has been so terrible for us to
live with. As for me, I can hardly stand to talk
about it even now, after more than fifty years.
We all loved our father so dearly!

"He lived three days after he was shot in the
back. The bullet lodged in his chest and ricocheted
so badly that they dared not move him, except into
the ranch house. He suffered terribly. He talked
to us and forgave us with all his heart and soul,
because he knew we did not mean to do it. We
were just carrying out his orders to shoot for help
if we saw anything moving. They embalmed him
at the ranch and then we took his body on the train
to be further prepared for burial. Then we took
his body on to Gunnison where his funeral and
burial were held, 12 Oct. 1917."

Sensitive people sometimes seem to die a
little themselves with experiences such as these;
but life must go on for them nevertheless, for they
too "have promises to keep and miles to go before
they sleep - and miles to go before they sleep".
Christian's descendants should take comfort in
his nobleness of character and the examples he
<span id="page-482"></span>
set for them in service to his fellowmen. (Has it
not been said in the scriptures - "For he that hath
done it unto the least of these, my brethren, hath
done it unto me".) Truly he was a doer of good as
well as a leader among men. Though he had little
opportunity for formal schooling, yet he was an
educated man with an educated heart - a great and
passionate heart. That one of his main goals was
to give his wife and children the better things of
life and leave them all well fixed, there can be no
doubt. For this he worked and labored hard, sacrificing
his own comfort. One cannot do everything
but Christian did much. He was a man of action.

* * * * *

Caroline Larsen (Christensen) wife of
Christian "I" Christensen, was born in Christenburg,
Sanpete, Utah 7 Apr. 1871, the daughter of
Ole Hansen Larsen and Inger Olsen (Larsen) early
Utah Pioneers. She was baptized a member of the
L. D. S. Church in the Sanpitch River which ran
near her home, in the early spring following her
eighth birthday. Her father was a farmer and a
freighter in those early Gunnison Valley days.
Caroline and her brothers and sisters helped on
the farm.

Pearl tells of her mother:-- "Caroline
gleaned wheat with her mother, Inger, and others,
and her little bare feet would get so sore. Her
mother would wash and oil them and wrap them up
in rags. Many a night the small girl cried in pain.
Shoes were very hard to get at those times. Caroline
had one pair for church and Sunday School,
'Sunday shoes' they were called. This one pair of
little shoes she treasured very much. She was
about ten years old before she had shoes to wear
all of the time. The Larsen children and others
from Christenburg had a long way to go to church
and Sunday School, Primary, Religion Class and
also school, for they had to go to Gunnison, several
miles away.

"Caroline was a happy natured child and loved
to help her mother. She loved to sit by her side
and sew. When she had a few pennies she would
<span id="page-483"></span>
buy a piece of calico and make quilt blocks, and by
the time she was thirteen years old she had pieced
the tops for three quilts. She was eager to learn
and besides sewing she loved music and painting.
When she grew older she did a number of beautiful
paintings. She was very talented with her hands.
She was a beautiful seamstress and an excellent
cook. She learned to card wool, make rugs, quilt,
make butter and cheese and soap and cure meat,
and all the other early household arts that prepared
her to manage a successful home.

"Caroline and her brothers and sisters and
friends, including the Christensen children next
door, loved to swim in the Sanpitch River back of
their barn in what they called 'The Big Hole'. It
was here that her little sister, Josephine, age
four, was drowned. They found her little body a
mile down stream. The Larsen and Christensen
children, as neighbors, played together at many
things and Caroline Larsen and Christian Christensen
became childhood sweethearts while in
Christenburg.

"When Caroline was about fifteen years old
her father built a lovely home in Gunnison, where
they went to live in winters though they continued
to spend most of their summers on the farm in
North Christenburg. The first winter in their new
home her little brother Peter and sister Hanner
died of diphtheria during an epidemic.

"Caroline grew to be a beautiful young lady.
She was dainty and small of stature with lovely
blond hair and blue eyes, She was also soft
spoken, modest and gentle in nature - and she
was kind, She and Christian continued their
courtship which resulted in their marriage, 28
Dec. 1893, when he was twenty-six and she was
nearing twenty-three. The bride wore a pretty
robin-egg blue satin dress and orange blossoms
in her beautiful long blond hair. She made a
lovely wife and mother. The couple had eight
children, four girls and four boys: Pearl Eva,
Inger Elora, Giles Elmer, Christian LeRoy,
Orilla, Myrtle Ivy, Farrald DeLong, and Gorden
Larsen Christensen.
<span id="page-484"></span>

"When Caroline received word of Christian's
fatal accident she was frantic. Mr. Cope, secretary
for the Bennion Livestock Company, took her
to Wyoming to be near him, immediately, in his
car. She left the three younger children, Ivy,
Farrald and little Gorden, at home alone, with a
kind neighbor, Mrs. Seegmiller, to look out for
them if things went wrong. Pearl and Roy were of
course at the ranch and Elmer was on the farm in
Cedar Valley but soon joined the others. Caroline
was at Christian's bedside to bid him 'so long' when
the end came for him. His brother Louis and sister
Elsie and her two girls, and Bishop Clarence Rollins
of Lyman, Wyoming were on the train with Caroline,
Pearl and Roy when they brought the body to Salt
Lake City. Mr. Cope met them at the station and
did everything he could to help out. The body was
taken to the old Taylor Mortuary, then on West
Temple and First South. The others went on to
Gunnison where they were joined by their families,
as well as relatives and friends from both Wyoming
and Utah. But Caroline and her children stayed
several days in Salt Lake making preparations and
then all went down with the body, to join the others
for Christian's funeral and burial."

About two months later, 5 Dec. 1917, Caroline
took her children to the Salt Lake Temple and
had the necessary endowments and the sealing of
the family for eternity taken care of - all but Pearl,
who was then beyond the proper age. They were
accompanied by Christian's parents, Laurs and
Else K. Christensen. (Pearl had her own endow-
ments and was sealed to her parents some forty-
one years after, 26 June 1959, also in the Salt
Lake Temple.) Caroline herself went to the temple
often after that wonderful experience there that
December 1917, and continued to do so up until
three weeks before her death. She loved the
church and was a faithful attender to her duties as
a member. She had a strong testimony of the
divinity of the Gospel and her faith never wavered
throughout all the trials and tribulations of her
widowhood.

Caroline and Christian had been married
almost twenty-four years when he died, Just over
<span id="page-485"></span>
twelve years later her youngest son passed away,
lacking three months of his eighteenth birthday,
9 Jan. 1930, Christian had been well insured and
owned much property, which was soon sold. His
part of The Oasis, where he died, was purchased
by his brother Louis. The family would have been
left in fairly good circumstances had not the tender
hearted Caroline made some rather substantial
loans for which, through unforeseen circumstances,
she was never reimbursed, She herself died 8
June 1941, two months and one day following her
seventieth birthday, having outlived Christian
over twenty-three and a half years, during which
time she continued to live in her own home in Salt
Lake City. Following is part of an article which
was published in the Deseret News at the time of
her death.

"Funeral services for Mrs. Caroline Larsen
Christensen, 2732 South Ninth East Street, who
died Sunday at 9:50 p.m. at her home of natural
causes, will be conducted Wed. at 2 p.m. in the

## ANDREW "B" CHRISTENSEN

Andrew, second child of Laurs M. C. and Elise K. Christensen, was born Sunday 6 June 1869 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. Black Hawk Indian War hostilities were nearly over then and the railroad had just come to Utah Territory, the last spike having been driven at Promontory Point 10 May 1869, <span id="page-485"></span>linking the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads in a great transcontinental system. Andrew was named for his mother's father, the Danish version of the name being "Anders". When he was a young man he added the middle initial "B" and changed the last three letters of his surname from the original Danish spelling, "sen" to "son". He was less than a year old when his family moved into Gunnison Valley and here he spent most of the remainder of his childhood, in such communities as Gunnison, Mayfield and Christenburg. He was baptized a member of the L.D.S. church in Mayfield and it was here he also started school. We feel fortunate to have had choice contributions about him from each of his six children now living. Most of the remainder of Andrew's story comes
from them.

Wendell begins:-- "Father came from sturdy Danish stock-men and women of courage, faith and vision. At age thirteen he left home to work and help out. His first job was as a herder for the well-to-do but rather godless man, Julius Christensen, who spent time telling Andrew that a belief in God was utter foolishness. One day this man, while riding the range accompanied by father, was caught in a heavy cloudburst. In trying to cross a gulley, swollen with flood waters, the bankcaved in plunging horse and rider into the torrent. The man caught a hanging branch and was helped out by father, who said he never heard a man pray to God more fervently for deliverance."

Edythe tells a similar story about this professional atheist, Julius Christensen, and young Andrew:--"Father believed with heart and soul in the divinity of the Restored Gospel of Christ. Whether in jest or soberness, the older man made a point of now and then testing Andrew's faith. It nettled the younger man. One day it became necessary to cross a small lake. As often happens with almost no warning, a sudden squall developed. The wind blew hard and the waves rose high. The rowboat, near the center of the lake, jerked and tossed about until it seemed it would surely capsize. Andrew, who was rowing and fighting the elements with all his might, began praying fervently. To <span id="page-486"></span>his utter amazement, Julius dropped to his knees in the bottom of the boat and, calling upon Diety, also pleaded to be saved."

Wendell continues:-- "Much of father's time for the next six years was spent alone in the mountains and deserts far from home and loved ones. His companions were mostly sheep, wild animals and rough men. He had many hair-raising experiences of which he told us years and years later, before the fire on long evenings. He was a marvelous story teller and we children would sit entranced, reliving such experiences with him.

One of my favorites was about the day he had climbed to a high ledge on a slope overlooking the sheep herd and was deep in study when his attention was drawn to a disturbance in the flock. Looking down he saw a huge grizzly bear coming up the slope toward him. Although bears were not uncommon in the Henry Mountains, father was unarmed and this one seemed to have but one object in mind-him! First young Andrew shouted, then threw stones, but the grizzly came steadily onward. In desperation he looked around for some means of defense when he noticed a deep crack in the ledge upon which he stood. Bracing himself against the mountainside, he placed his heels in the crack and pushed and strained with all his might. Slowly the crack began to widen and, just as the bear reached the bottom of the ledge, a great section broke loose, crashing with a thud in front of the beast, followed by a shower of rocks and dirt. The bear rose on his haunches, then turned and headed straight down the mountain with a large boulder close behind and gaining speed at every turn. Father said he never saw a bear run so fast! The last glimpse he had of the brute was as it headed into the scrub oak and quaking aspen, with the huge rock speeding unchecked behind, crashing trees and brush in its path. The sight hit father's 'funny-bone' and he literally rolled on the ground and laughed.

"Through all his lonely days and nights he never ceased to remain true to the teachings of his parents and his church. Truly he lived close to the Lord during those years and had some remarkable spiritual experiences which comforted <span id="page-487"></span>him in his loneliness and strengthened him in his
faith and convictions as to the part he personally might play in shaping the world about him. All boys have dreams, but Andrew's were a bit vast. But to him they were real and he seemed to see before him all the means for their realization. During those years he never ceased to study and prepare for the future that began to take shape in his young, active mind. He dreamed of getting an education and kept books in a box in the sheep wagon. These he studied frequently, preparing for the day when he could go back to school and then begin his accomplishments."

Luther writes:--"There is nothing under heaven quite like herding sheep to make an intelligent young man realize there are better things in life. It was sometime during those half dozen years of playing nursemaid to the wooly creatures that there developed in father a longing for a more formal education. Those long hours, while the sheep bedded down at midday and at nights, gave ample time for him to daydream and formulate his plans, and from the classrooms of nature he learned well. It was from this period of his life that he drew much of the material for the wonderful and sometimes hair-raising experiences that he later told us children; the true stories that kept us quiet on long, slow, dusty wagon or car rides, rated with refreshments at our home evenings, or produced lucious drowsiness at bedtime."

Again we quote from Wendell's narrative:-- "At age nineteen father had acquired some sheep of his own and he decided to put one of his brothers in charge of them and start school. He went back to Gunnison and finished the grades, embarrassed by his size and age. Seminary followed, where he got high grades. He became a fine scholar. He went on to the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, the fall of 1891, and here he spent most of the next four winters. He taught part time the one of 1893-94 and graduated from the Academy 23 May 1895, with the degree of Bachelor of Pedegogy.

It was while at B.Y.A. the winter of 1891/92 that father became better acquainted with Sarah Jane Bartholomew and her older sister Roxie. <span id="page-488"></span>He fell in love with Sarah. The year following his graduation they were married. This took place 1 July 1896 in the Manti Temple. (Andrew had been given a mission call to the southern states earlier that year, but this was changed in order that he might accept a call to develop the school at Kanab, Utah.) In July or August following their marriage, the honeymoon trip was made in a wagon containing all of their belongings as they made their way southeast, where father was to serve as Principal of the Kanab District School."

Andrew and Sarah boarded and roomed at the home of a son of Jacob Hamblin, Walter Hamblin and his wife Blanch Robinson Hamblin, who had been married only about two years themselves. The house in which they lived is still standing and today is owned by some descendants of the Hamblins. A ninety-one year old lady still living in Kanab (1968) Mrs. Blanch Hicks Mace, once lived in the house across the road from the Hamblin place. She remembers going there many years ago and seeing a beautiful handmade picture of some yarn flowers hanging on the wall. She was told that Mrs. A.B. Christensen made the picture for Blanch Hamblin, when they lived there together in the Gay Nineties. Mrs. Mace also remembers her husband, Charles Mace, speaking of Principal A.B. Christensen, who signed Charlie's certificate of promotion from the 7th grade of the Kanab District School, 1 Apr. 1898. This certificate is still intact.

Andrew's children have divided their accounts of him into three parts - Dreams Dreamed - Dreams Realized - Dreams Unfulfilled. Edythe writes;--"Being the eldest child to live, I shall write mostly of the second part, for from these years I can report first hand. Father did not do things by halves. A degree from B.Y.U. was not enough. After two winters of teaching in Kanab he took mother and their firstborn, Adelbert, to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he entered the School of Literature at the University there. This is when I made my appearance."

Andrew remained in Ann Arbor for nearly three years and won his diploma, being graduated <span id="page-489"></span>with high honors in the class of 1901. Returning with his family to Utah, he received a call to head the Church Academy at St. George. This was the forerunner of Dixie College. He remained in the
school at St. George for two or three years and then located his family in Provo. Sometime following the birth of their third child, Wendell, most likely the spring of 1904, Andrew left for some advanced study in Germany. While in Europe he visited his father's and mother's relatives in Denmark. His studies in Germany, however, were interrupted prematurely by the death, in Provo, of his eldest son, Adelbert, December 1904. Andrew withdrew from school and hurried back home to comfort his wife and family.

Edythe continues: "Andrew's advanced study paid off. He was given the principalship, plus a teaching post, at the Latter-day High School in Salt Lake City. Dreams were being realized. He signed on some excellent teachers. He was a tremendous organizer and his schools ran smoothly. He was also a forceful, gifted speaker and made many talks in the Wards and Stakes throughout the valley in the interest of increased enrollment. He radiated a magnetic presence, a retentive memory, imagination, drive and purpose.

"It was when we first lived in Salt Lake that brother Sheldon was born, and three years later my first sister, Elsie Eliza. Father purchased a home on a large corner lot at the juncture of 27th South 9th East. The home was nice to look at, built of red brick in a compact, artistic form. Sections of the front window were of stained glass, forming abay. The rooms were lovely with their richly embossed wallpaper of wine-red, gold and blue. There was an upper floor with bedrooms; but best of all, a long combination storage and playroom. Here stood the trunk that contained many of mother's once-used dresses, including her white organdy wedding gown plus the dainty, French kid slippers with seed-pearl-studded bows. French heels and pointed toes.

"These were fruitful, happy times. There was always so much to do or investigate or construct. There were the annual trips to our <span id="page-490"></span>delightful relatives in Sanpete County; jaunts to the sheep camps; and in cooler weather, our memorable 'family evenings' where mother played the hymns and sang alto and father told the most wonderful stories that always called for 'just one more'. Father could recite poetry too and often did; we were held bound under his magnetic spell. Then there were our Christmases, which were something to remember, especially the one when we children found coal in the toes of our stockings.

"We had been duly warned but were a little unbelieving. Our downcast faces burst into joy when we were led by our mischievous, doting parents to investigate the other rooms. In the front one a fire sputtered from the grate and a Christmas tree sparkled, alight with tinsel and candles. (It had been fashioned overnight from the lower boughs of our own evergreens.) And oh what gifts there were. Mother had dressed a doll with real hair for me and father hadn't forgotten the books and other exciting things to delight us all. Little did we know that one of our very next Christmases would be spent in Germany at the home of one of father's professors, a Herr Doctor, whose name I have forgotten, and that the gifts would be beyond any we had ever seen, like something from a fairy tale, for Germany was then the toy center of the world.

"On our lot in Salt Lake City were a garden, orchard, berries, a natural spring gushing forth clear, cool water, and our own fishpond which father had built. But our baby sister was far too fond of water and her later drowning, the early spring of 1910, in this pond, brought a sobering period into all our lives, coupled with a haunting remorse that lay just below the surface for many years to come. (More detail has been given earlier of little Elsie's death.) Father became restless - did he blame himself?

"By July of the same year, father, mother, my two brothers and I were enroute to Europe, where father planned to study again. We had sold our home in Salt Lake to generous Uncle Chris to help finance the same. Father continued to take an interest in explaining, showing, guiding and <span id="page-491"></span>our eager lives. Mother also threw off her sadness as best she could and seemed to enjoy this period of her life.

"Father at first did some research at Christ College in Oxford, England. But for part of each day members of his family were also educated when, under his expert guidance, we wandered through the various colleges with their lovely green, deer-infested parks; the many musty, vine covered old churches; walked along the tree-shaded banks of the winding river and even rowed boats on the same quiet stream. Sometimes we watched the rowing teams or opposing teams of young men engaged in playing rugby or cricket. We browsed through secondhand book stores and rode on street cars drawn by horses along crooked streets that had originally served as cow trails.

"We left England and met Grandfather and Grandmother Christensen in the Province of Thisted, Denmark. Then followed a few weeks of nothing but visiting our Danish relatives. In the main they were prosperous appearing farmers with fine, snug barns boasting fat, sleek animals and many ducks and geese. The hand of welcome was extended until 'Mormonism' was mentioned. Grandmother Christensen's visit had been in the interest of genealogy. She loved people and was in her true element. Father assisted her in this work. It was his second trip to Denmark and the relatives there. At the Danish capitol of Copenhagen, he made time
to take us to the Thorvaldsen Museum and Chapel that houses the moving sculptures of Christ and His Twelve Apostles. Father related the story of the artist Thorvaldsen's humble beginning when as a poor boy, along the wharf, he was discovered whittling remarkable little figures of wood. Someone of note spotted the boy's potential and started him on his way towards becoming Denmark's greatest sculptor.

"From Denmark we went to Germany where father studied next. We were taken by him to see children's plays staged with unbelievable imagination and delight. 'Hansel and Gretel' and many of the fairy tales were made real before our very eyes. We visited the 'Gowandhaus', world famous <span id="page-492"></span>

concert hall established by Felix Mendelssohn, and took a journey to the site of the huge, almost ugly mausoleum of stone commemorating the Napoleanic
War victims who lost their lives in that vicinity.

Sometime in late spring, following my third brother Luther's birthday in May 1911, father received an invitation from one of the professors of the Sorbonne in Paris. For five weeks, five men were to live at his home and there study, discuss and absorb whatever phase of research he chose. This was a wonderful opportunity for father. The family headed for Paris, all except Wendell and I who were left at school in Germany.

"Returning from Europe the early fall of 1911, father was given a full professorship at Brigham Young University. It was about the end of our stay at Provo that my second sister, Lucile, was born (1914) for after three years of teaching at B.Y.U. father was called to head the Church Academy at Rexburg, Idaho. Here he was instrumental in establishing Ricks as a college. During his sojourn there, from 1914 to 1917, improvements were made, a new gymnasium built and the student enrollment climbed to new totals."

Wendell again takes up the story:--"During the last year in Rexburg father rented a wheat farm twenty miles east of the city. The crops were already planted and all our family had to do was keep it free from mustard weed and marauding cattle. It was a marvelous summer vacation. When harvest time came we called in the 'combines' which cut and threshed for a share in the profits. After all expenses, father realized $3,000, almost as much as an entire year's teaching salary. He began to feel restless again. He had not forgotten those boyhood dreams and was becoming impatient with the low salaries and limited opportunities within the confines of the schools.

"His daughter Edythe had become a bit thin and anemic but there was nothing so serious that a summer in the sunshine wouldn't cure. Father seized upon this as an excuse to leave Ricks and the schoolroom, and in the spring of 1917 moved the family (much to mother's disappointment) to <span id="page-493"></span>the warm, dry climate of Utah's Dixie. He settled us in the very small community of LaVerkin, within walking distance of his option-to-title-acquired mineral hot springs on the bank of the Virgin Rive where, with the help of Sheldon, myself and an occasional hired man with team and scraper, father began to build a bath house near the LaVerkin Hot Springs. The development of these springs had long been in his plans. He visualized a health spa, with tourist cabins on the hillside and hot mineral baths piped to every cabin. The water there seemed to have unusual properties and people came from near and far to enjoy it. Along with the hot springs, father had made filings on the waters of the Virgin River and had plans for building a dam near the entrance to Zions Canyon, which would provide irrigation for thousands of acres of desert land in a climate nearly equal to that of California. It was a good plan and money for the initial work was acquired from the local people and everything was ready to start. The U.S. Government was ready to put up about six million dollars. Unfortunately war was declared between the United States and Germany about that time and all government reclamation commitments were withdrawn.

"This was a severe setback for father. He had come so close to real wealth, possibly millions, from the sale of land under this project. Instead he was left in debt and years of hard work and planning had been lost. But soon he was again called into the service of the church school system. This time it was to go to Hinckley, Millard Co., Utah to head up the church school there. This was in the summer of 1918. Father and the rest of the family went ahead to Hinckley to find a place to live, leaving Sheldon and I, fifteen and thirteen years old respectively, to bring a load of our belongings from LaVerkin. The roads were not as they are today and it was a hard trip through sandstorms, snowstorms and mud. As we neared our destination the country appeared barren and desolate. We passed a covered wagon headed back towards Fillmore. Across the canvas cover was printed a large sign - 'In God we trusted and in Delta we rusted'. (Delta was a town near Hinckley.) <span id="page-494"></span>

"Father found a house and farm near the edge of town and here we settled. He was soon busy with school and business trips, leaving Sheldon and I, under mother's direction, to run the farm. We worked hard but with poor results. Little would grow. This experience ended any real interest in farming either of us would ever have. This place held little challenge and interest for father as well, for though he went through the motions faithfully, his soul did not respond. One good thing to come out of Hinckley, however, was our baby sister Margaret, born there the last of May that year 1919. About the same time father resigned the posts of school teacher, principal and president of schools for the rest of his life."

Lucile's clear-cut memories of events began about this time. She says: 'As a child I had a fearless passion for horses. While we still lived in Hinckley we owned a cantankerous team named Fox and Dobin. Often as they stood feeding in the barn I would crawl under them up into the manger and manage to mount one, via its neck. When the team was hitched for plowing I was usually there and one time, misjudging my timing, I slipped from the front seat of the disk-plow and fell behind the horses, gashing my lip to make a scar I still carry.

"Soon after this experience we moved to Starr Ranch, between Mona and Santaquin. After we were settled there father, understanding my unsatiable longing for a horse, gave me a little sure-footed mare which I promptly named 'Queen'. For the full summer I remember no other companion than the beautiful animal on whose back I lived and dreamed."

Wendell picks up the story:--"Being finished with school by the spring of 1919, father turned his whole attention to his projects. With a younger brother, Judge Albert Christensen, and a brother-in-law of mother's, Otis Ercanbrack, he acquired the Star Ranch about eighteen miles north of Nephi, Utah. It was a beautiful place near the foot of lofty mountains from which flowed both surface and underground streams. Much of the land was watered by deep artesian wells. To the west was <span id="page-495"></span>a lake stocked with fish, and in the fall with an abundance of ducks and wild geese. On this property stood three large brick houses. The one to the north in which we lived was beautifully furnished and gave our family many happy hours.

"When we moved to Star Ranch, Edythe had been ready for college and Sheldon and I for High School. Arrangements were made to move the family to Provo in winters between 1919 to 1922, for short school terms, but the remainder of the time we worked on the ranch. In the fall of 1921 Edythe left for study in Boston. By working part time and through frugal living, a scholarship, a loan from an available church school fund, the help of an occasional relative or friend and the Lord, she made it through two consecutive years of study. Father could only give encouragement and mother did her part by sending a dress now and then that she had sewn or remodled beautifully.

"The Star Ranch venture seemed to hold great promise and for a time prosperity seemed assured. Crops were planted - wheat, alfalfa and sugar beets. There were also horses, cattle, chickens and pigs on the place, which was well equipped with barns and corrals. With the addition of some machinery, including a tractor, we were in business. We children all worked very hard and were proud and happy and filled with hope for the future. There was talk among us of college, missions, travel and great accomplishments. On the other hand, father seemed impatient for success. He was offered an additional opportunity to buy a cattle ranch of about 5,000 acres near Duchesne, in eastern Utah. The bank was willing to put up the money and, with a thousand head of cattle thrown into the bargain, this looked very attractive - so he made the deal. A quick calculation on father's part placed our total wealth then at almost $500,000, which, with luck and a few good years, would pay off all the debts and plenty to go.

"The winter of 1922 started our normal enough. Crops had been good. Cattle were fat and ready for the market with an offered price of $60.00 a head - $60,000 for the herd. Wheat was bid at $2.00 a bushel and we had 10,000 bushels to <span id="page-496"></span>sell. Word went around among the farmers, however, that prices would be higher in the spring and to hold their crops. Spring never really came. The snow was heavy and stayed on the ground until nearly May. Food for cattle became scarce and father was forced to buy hay at $40.00 a ton to keep 1,000 head of cattle from starving. Again the banks advanced the money. Finally, when winter ended, the market had vanished for both cattle and wheat. It was almost impossible to sell at any price. The banks which had loaned so freely now wanted their money. Farmers, who for all their lives had been able to get almost any amount on signature, were given a flat 'no!' Father of course was over-extended. It cost him his share of the ranches and all other owned assets to get out, and he still owed thousands of dollars.

"In 1923 we left Star Ranch and moved to Salt Lake City. I suppose we had lived in worse places but the little house on the bend of the Jordan River was at least a place to house the family now in dire financial straits. Mother, brave and cheerful, set about, with almost no money, to make the place livable, scrubbing, cleaning, painting and papering, with the help of us children. I remember my pride in helping to select the paper which, when hung, looked great.

"I don't know just how father managed; I'm sure he was deeply discouraged and for a time there was little for him to do but borrow from friends and relatives. He was gone a great deal trying to get things going. For a time he got a job of some kind in the southern part of the state somewhere, sending mother the money to meet accumulated bills. Edythe was asked to come home from school in the east, which she did, finding an immediate job to help out. Sheldon and I worked in some mines in Farmington Canyon for the same purpose.

"Gradually our situation improved. Father, by some means, rented a big house on South Main Street into which we moved." Lucile tells of this:-- "We lived in a large red brick house on Main Street next to the McKinley School. Here were both parlor and living room, and in the latter a fireplace. <span id="page-497"></span>Before this fireplace stood father's great big leather rocker. I remember one winter night he built a blazing fire, cuddled Margaret on his one side and me on the other as he sat and let us choose the stories he would tell. As he gently rocked he took us into the sheep camps to watch him outwit a prowling bobcat; he led us up the path to a castle on the Rhine and he walked with us through Tom Tower at Oxford. Finally, as the fire burned to embers and we fell into our dreams, he carried us one by one and tucked us into bed. Though the time he spent with us younger children was limited, it had a rich and satisfying flavor. We never felt neglect or indifference from him."

Margaret writes;--"As I look back on early childhood, most of my memories center around our home at 1879 South Main Street. It was a large two-story, red brick home with plenty of room for a big family. There was a large yard, many beautiful trees, places for secret hide-outs, and plenty of room to play hide-and-seek and run-sheep-run. There was a large garden area where each of us took our turns weeding and helping with irrigation. There was also a running well where one could get the coldest drink on a hot summer day in all Salt Lake. Mother usually kept a few chickens to help supply her family with fresh eggs and also to help with an extra treat for some of those delicious Sunday dinners.

"I remember my father was a lover of good books. We had a fine library at home and were encouraged to use it. How I loved to curl up on a rainy afternoon and lose myself in a good book. This was another heritage father passed onto us - the joy of reading. Religion played a most important role in our family life also. In fact, it seemed that our lives literally revolved around the church. And even though father was not home a great deal, we knew that we were to attend our meetings and do our duty there above all else. I heard him talk in Sacrament meetings many times and there was no doubt in my mind but that he had a strong and lasting testimony of the Gospel. Mother shared this strong testimony.

"Fundamentally, Papa was a sincere family <span id="page-498"></span>man. He loved us children but always expected us to be well mannered and respectful. He could be stern when he had to but he could be jolly and fun to be with too. When he was in a teasing mood his beautiful blue eyes would twinkle. As I remember,
he never spanked me. His most severe punishment was sternly sending me to my room to contemplate my shortcomings. I'm afraid Mom was delegated to correct me for more serious offenses and this was usually done when Papa was away. I always felt envious of my older brothers and sister who had been to Europe with our parents and had such tremendous experiences. I think father realized this and had every intention of making this up to the younger members of the family, for he would many times share his dreams with us as to what was in store for us as soon as 'the big deal' went through.

"My papa was one of the grandest persons I have ever known. During the few short years that I was privileged to know him, he furnished me with some of my most vivid and cherished memories, as well as some of the most valued lessons of my childhood. To me he was always a kind and loving father, coming home from his various business trips with tales of the almost-to-be-realized fortune, which was his great dream during the later years of his life. Educated and intelligent as he was, it was very hard for mother to rationalize his philosophy concerning his great desire to become a man of wealth through the complicated fields of investment and real estate. This desire became almost an obsession with him.

"Father could well have been the originator of the saying 'Early to bed and early to rise, etc.' This was the way he lived and believed firmly that everyone else should follow suit. We were never allowed the privilege of 'sleeping in' when he was home. Five o'clock usually found us up and doing and, though we may have felt we were being treated a little unfairly, we all seemed to learn not to waste time, to take advantage of the beauty of nature, and that working and accomplishing things brings joy." Luther adds to this evaluation of their father:--"He was generally up at daylight <span id="page-499"></span>and wanted everyone else up. The nearest I ever came to a 'licking' resulted in my going back to sleep after I had been called to get up. The covers came off and father had me by the ear and into my clothes so fast the incident remains in my memory as a blur. He seemed to have the notion that cows gave sour milk after five in the morning. He seemed always in a hurry. He could hardly wait for the frost to go out of the ground to put in a garden, then wanted peas and potatoes before the potatoes had grown much larger than the peas.

"For reasons I don't recall, I didn't start school until I was seven and father seemed determined I should make up for that lost time. There were endless sessions sitting beside Dad, a first grade reader in my lap and tears streaming down my face, with half a mind on the reading and the other half exploring the haunted castles across the alley back of the house. Times tables were another grim chore.

"I remember father as not a large man, but one who looked big at the head of the table and who seemed to stand out in a crowd. I remember him as a strict disciplinarian, yet I cannot recall many stern reprimands or punishments. I was kept somewhat in line by mother's words, 'Your father will hear of this when he gets home'. The longer he was gone the longer the list of 'hear abouts' became and the more I dreaded his return. The 'hear abouts' were resolved listening to lectures on hard work, dependability, truth and honesty, and other virtues that seemed appropriate.

"It is with reluctance and mixed feelings that I put into words the pictures of father that were etched into my memory and had an influence on my life. It was during the last few years of his teaching career that my recollections of him began. He became restless and appeared to be in a hurry to get places. He seemed dissatisfied with things as they were and began to spend more time traveling in search of undeveloped, artistic and inventive talent, land, water, minerals and products."

Wendell writes: "The time when we were living in the big house on South Main Street in Salt <span id="page-500"></span>Lake City played a significant part in the shaping of our lives. We were in the Farmers Ward and we soon became active in church there and made many close friends. It was while located here that Sheldon and I were called on our missions to Germany; here that our younger, nature-loving brother Luther, then fourteen, ran away from home and was gone nearly two years; here that Edythe was courted and won by Dr. Burtis F.Robbins; and here that Lucile and Margaret met their future husbands and that Sheldon and I met and later married our wives.

"When I returned from my mission father was deeply involved in plans to revive the Dixie Irrigation Project and to develop some little known resources in Southern California. His fertile brain had conceived new possibilities in metals and alloys so advanced that large corporations, such as the Ford Motor Co., became interested and promised large sums of money to develop one possibility - only to find on closer examination that this brilliant idea had little substance. During this time I spent all my time with father. I took no other job and dropped plans to continue school. I drove the car on his trips, worked on his projects and met his business partners, until I finally realized that he was being used by unscrupulous men, whose sole object was to keep him sold on their non-existent skills to the end that he raise more money to feed and maintain them in the perpetuation of a hoax. The cost ran into thousands. Being the oldest living son, I was rather involved in our financial and business affairs and was often given responsibilities which I was not equipped to bear. In the process, I grew and developed but father had real need for someone with wisdom and practical business experience to balance his vision and enthusiasm. I was not up to the job, and among others with whom he counseled there were few who had either time or experience to really help."

Luther goes on:--"Father spent considerable time, effort and money helping artists such as Fairbanks, Campbell and Ramsey; guiding them into scenic areas he knew so well and purchasing some of the pictures realized from those trips. <span id="page-501"></span>He became interested in one of the earliest radios; a safety tire design that now, forty years later, is coming into use, and in a metal railroad tie that may yet be used. Of course the Star Ranch and Uinta property, which he had visualized as the beginning of a great cattle empire, came to naught. He had seen in the fertile but dry land below the Virgin River and Deep Creek a great irrigation project if the water from those streams could be harnessed and utilized. The LaVerkin hot springs, which later my wife saw as much too hot at one end, much too cold at the other, and all of them much too smelly, father had seen as a great medical center where specialists of the world could apply their skills. He tried to develop the clay beds back of Redmond, Utah in order to utilize the medical properties of that clay. He recognized the potential value of the rare metal deposits along the Sierra Nevada Range, which now are being mined for tungsten and other elements so vital in the production of alloys for the aircraft and space industries.

"These projects required large amounts of capital and into them went every cent he had or could raise. It was during the height of this quest for finances that I had the privilege of driving him. He was pushing himself to the limit of his strength and ability. In order to conserve his energy and save hotel bills, we traveled at night while he slept. It was amazing how he could sleep most of the night sitting up in a car, spend fifteen minutes shaving and freshening up in a service station wash room, then come out looking as fresh and well groomed as a New York banker. On longer trips, such as those between Salt Lake and California, there was time for sleep and also for long talks. He was never critical of the past, never tried to place blame for his disappointments. He was always enthusiastic toward the future, always planning new projects or enlarging present ones. He was the master of words. He used them to build empires or castles or fortunes and as you listened you became involved and wanted to help. It was like a trip to Utopia and what you saw was a better world and a glorious hereafter. There was a world in which as yet untapped resources were used for the betterment of man; oil was extracted from vast <span id="page-502"></span>shale beds; courses of rivers were changed to make the deserts bloom, and the minds of all men were turned toward good. There was a powerful church in which his belief never faltered; strong family ties and a love for literature and music. It was to help reach this Utopia that so many paid the fare, for his words created a vision of smooth roads, pleasant company and ample rewards at the end of the journey. It was as a guide for this trip that he lived and for which he expended his energy. It has been said that his ideas were twenty years ahead of the times; that the world was not then ready for them. Who knows what might have happened had he gone more slowly, been more cautious, planned more carefully, built more solidly and dreamed less - who knows?"

"Father always tried," says Wendell, "but he was human and so made mistakes and sometimes those mistakes loomed large. He was no ordinary man; in fact he was far in advance of his times. Many, having been touched by the magic of his vision, were made far better and lifted up by that experience. There were countless ways in which he showed his love and concern, countless lessons which he taught with insight and right timing, for no one can deny but that he was a great teacher - countless ones have attested to that. In his last years he drove himself without mercy, though he was sick and the doctors begged him to stop. In his travels he was often hungry, living in cheap rooms and having to borrow money to get home to mother. From her he would only borrow more to further other fruitless trips and divide his few dollars among hangers-on who bled him for all he could raise. As I look back I think father felt left out and somewhat deserted those last years. His family, for whom he had worked and planned so much, had begun to go its separate ways and each member was becoming independent. Even mother, with rare business insight and tireless effort, had created a profitable sewing business and was no longer dependent on him. It was a hard role for father to play and without a doubt, in my opinion, helped to hasten his death."

Margaret says, "During the last years of <span id="page-503"></span>father's life he was afflicted with diabetes. Having been ill hardly a day up to this time, it was difficult, if not impossible, for him to accept the fact that he really had this disease and that if it were not properly controlled by diet and insulin it could cost his life. Mother was so careful in planning his meals, even to weighing everything he ate while he was at home. She baked special bread, bottled fruit without sugar and planned proper, appetizing meals to send with him when he traveled. But to no avail, for as soon as he left home he would eat at restaurants, paying no attention to her instructions for his diet, and would often return home almost in diabetic coma. Several times this necessitate his having to be taken to the hospital to be treated until his blood sugar was again at a safe level. He would never be convinced that each of these episodes was weakening his resistance to other infections and having a dangerous effect on his health.

"During one of his frequent trips to Southern California he contracted a severe chest cold that developed into pneumonia. He tried once again to make it home where he knew he would get loving care, but became so ill he had to be taken off the bus at St. George. On the morning of Dec. 17, 1931, mother received the shattering news that father had passed away. With his death came the end of my childhood."

Sheldon concludes the narrative:--"Although father liked fine things, in traveling he was more apt to choose a modest hotel room with single-bulb, drop light switch, where perhaps the only item furnished to brighten the accomodation was a small cake of lavendar soap of artificial lilac bouquet. Nor, with his affliction of diabetes, was his prescribed diet adhered to. Again there was a marked tendency to deny himself in his valiant effort at reaching for the stars. Through it all, however, I do not recall seeing him when his clothes were not pressed, when he was not clean shaven or when his shoes were not shined. Except when he traveled, he was by habit akin to our feathered friends, in that he always retired and rose with the chickens. In this respect he utterly shattered Ben Franklin's statement, 'Early to bed, early to rise, makes a <span id="page-504"></span>man healthy, wealthy and wise!'

"Father died alone in a modest hotel room in St. George. Oddly enough, 'twas in the same locale where years prior he pioneered, organized and established the school that became a very successful church college, endearing himself to the rugged and good people of that community. Traveling in severe cold of that December, 1931, I arrived at St. George about fifteen hours after father's passing. In the last moments of his life, despite complications of pneumonia and diabetes, still he bothered to wind his inexpensive time piece. I remember well, I cried as I held the watch, knowing that so long as it ticked, a last bit of father's tremendous energy still remained. Whether he really died of a broken heart or was mercifully taken in illness, I do not know. But of one thing I
am certain, there still remained an unsubdued determination and dignity about him to the end. He was buried in the City Cemetery at Provo, Utah 20 Dec. 1931.

"To do biographical justice to the life of our father, Andrew "B" Christensen, would involve an enormous amount of time. We have written less than a hundredth part. I feel keenly that the story of his life must be recorded realistically, as well as in his defense. The most dominant and consistent parts of the many phases of father's life were his unusual drive and his fierce determination. He mastered, absolutely, many most difficult skills. As an example:-In the early twenties I listened to the spell-binding oratory of William Jennings Bryan (no less) as he stood on the front steps of the old Jesse Knight home in Provo. Yet, by all methods of comparison, I have heard my own father deliver some addresses that out-classed Bryan's. Here's another example:--In June, 1929, I returned from the German-Austrian Mission. For thirty-one months my ears and tongue had been accustomed to the sounds and pronunciations of the 'Deutsche Sprache' (German language). At the same time, I knew father's exposure to German had been about nil for more than a decade and I could hardly wait to test his supposed academic knowledge of the language. When the opportunity <span id="page-505"></span>came, I proudly initiated the conversation. He came back articulate, with grammatically perfect German and, mind you, completely without an English accent. I could hardly believe my ears. Then, as his keen memory began to recall German axioms and adages, which he quoted verbatim with amazing ease and versatility, I found it much more comfortable to change the whole subject. No question about it, this man was a master.

"But great minds have master passions and there's no denying that many strong men, in adversity or under mental stress, have turned to some perverted sort of habit or activity, dissipating their time, talent and strength. Father was tested with many circumstances and in a wide variety of circles, but he was never enticed. But then again, father was a man of great vision. Through the annals of time many visionary men with the best of intentions have been careless and even reckless in fiscal matters. Of this, father was a classic example. During the period of his life when his dreams were mostly unfulfilled, he borrowed heavily from many sources. Unfortunately, most of his debts were never repaid. At the same time he was most prudent in spending for himself or his person. What he borrowed went into projects or for travel. In his immense undertakings he probed considerable chemical, metalurgical and scientific
fields, gathered endless samples, set out to discover mining deposits throughout the entire west and procured numerous options and leases. Had he succeeded in his projects he would have been a hero and, believe me, anyone who had helped him would have been rewarded handsomely.

"Father wanted to help rather than hurt anyone. Always the ultimate betterment of others was uppermost in his mind. I think he resented secretly, as do others, many of the financial limitations in our economic system which are imposed upon so many. But for him resentment wasn't enough; he took off in dead earnest to do something about it, not by way of exploiting the rich or by the political route of higher tax imposts but through arduous and unrelenting struggle to organize and develop dormant resources around <span id="page-506"></span>him, both tangible and intangible. He saw these great needs - but he saw them too soon. In the end he sacrificed his health and, literally, died trying to achieve his objectives.

"In father's entire life there was nothing halfway. There were lofty peaks and there were lowly valleys - but not much in between. He was no ordinary person and he thought big. He retained an abiding faith in God and, throughout his life, boldly proclaimed the divine mission of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. With the exception of the fiscal matters before mentioned, father upheld the standards and principles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and sustained its designated authorities. At their every call he responded without question. Had he been asked, I'm sure he would have traveled barefoot to 'Timbucktu!' In summary, Dear Descendants, whether we cherish or disdain, this is all part of heritage from our beloved progenitor and father."

Lucile writes: "It was during my senior year in High School and about Christmas time that father passed away. I still remember the bleakness, the cold, the sense of loss. In his last years we had seen him bear the weight of illness and financial loss, but he bore them like a man. We never saw him mean or complaining. Since then, time, marriage, children and dreams of our own have helped to erase the loss and total up the blessings: Father loved us; he dreamed big and worked to realize those dreams; he achieved greatly in the fields of scholarship, culture, teaching and school administration." And Edythe adds, "Perhaps his death came as a grateful release ... who knows? I like to feel that he is now unfettered, inspired and enthusiastic in the work in which he was so well qualified - so nobly endowed."

Sarah Jane Bartholomew (Christenson) wife of Andrew "B", was born in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah Sept. 8, 1875, the daughter of John and Eliza Roxie Metcalf Bartholomew. There were nine children in the family. Fayette was a Mormon settlement <span id="page-507"></span>far removed from the bustling growth of Salt Lake
City and essentially dependent upon its own resources for all commodities. The Bartholomew children learned early to work. Food was raised, hunted or fished for and then dried, smoked or pickled for preservation. Sheep's wool was sheared, carded, spun, dyed and knit or woven into clothing and household articles. Furniture was made and rugs were woven or braided and tacked over straw matting for comfort and wear. Soap, starch, flour, bread and sweets were all home prepared.

"Sarah's father was called to serve as Bishop of the community when she was about two years old; a position which he held until his death in 1914. When death came to the community, the Bishops fashioned the coffin from well seasoned wood and his wife lined it with quilted cotton. (He most likely presided at the funeral and preached the sermon as well.) Tithing was paid in produce to the Bishop as custodian for the Church, and often went to feed the ever-present Indian. Later, when the Manti Temple was being built, this tithing-food was carried to feed the laborers who were donating their time to its building.

"At the age of eight, Sarah's responsibility of doing dishes began. She hated this task, and with good reason; but without whining she carried water from the irrigation ditch, heated it on the wood burning stove and with lye-soap, brick shavings and coarse muslin toweling, washed, scoured and dried. When she played or visited, her freedom was restrained by a younger child to tend or an inevitable stocking to knit. Such early discipline prepared her for challenges to come. She attended public school in Fayette and church Seminary in Gunnison, where she first met Andrew Christensen. Later she and her older sister Roxie attended B.Y.A. in Provo, Utah, where she became better acquainted with Andrew and was courted by him there." When she married this promising young college graduate (1 Juiy 1895) and accompanied him to his first school position in Kanab, Utah, their honeymoon trip was on an open hayrack upon which their few belongings jostled as they drove a team across the long, hot, <span id="page-508"></span>dusty primitive "road".

She was allowed to return to her parents' home in Fayette for the birth of her first child and son, Adelbert. Her first daughter, Edith (Edythe) arrived while her husband was working for his Masters degree at Ann Arbor, Michigan at the turn of the century. Her third child, Wendell, was also born at Fayette. The following year she and the children were living in Provo, Utah while Andrew was studying in Germany, when their child Adelbert died of diphtheria before his father could return. Her fourth child, Sheldon, was born in Salt Lake City at the beginning of a happy and successful almost six years, during which Andrew served as Principal of the L.D.S. High School there. It was three years after moving to Salt Lake that her fifth child, Elsie Eliza, was born, and less than two years later that this little one was drowned and taken from her.

"To help assuage their grief and to enable Andrew to continue his advanced studies, they sold their lovely home where so much joy had been theirs, and this last sorrow, and with the three remaining children left for Europe. In preparation, Sarah had managed a large strawberry patch, with hired help and the children, picking, crating and marketing the berries. Her earnings were used in Europe gathering treasured items for the many houses she was later to transform into homes. Sarah loved this period of her life. It was in Germany that her sixth child and last son, Luther, was born (Leipzig). In Europe she joined her husband in living or traveling in England, Denmark, Germany and France (Paris) while he was studying there. The day before they were ready to return to the States, after a little over a year in Europe, baby Luther was stricken with pneumonia. Through prayer, and the skill of a kind German doctor, the child was healed and made the long return trip without further harm." How grateful Sarah must have been to be spared another parting with one of her remaining little ones.

"Three years at Provo, where Andrew taught at B.Y.U. and another daughter, Lucile, <span id="page-509"></span>was born, followed by three more years living in
Rexburg, Idaho, where Andrew headed Ricks Academy, passed by and with their passing the taxing routine and confinement of administrative work, coupled with a long-cherished dream of his for further research, prompted Andrew to abandon his profession temporarily for the fields of investment, promotion and speculation. He hoped thereby to hasten his permanent retirement from both teaching and business, making it possible for him to have freedom to probe the fields of ancient languages and archeology with a view to scholarly substantiation of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Sarah too must have been wrapped up in his dreams but, being of a more practical nature, must have worried about pulling up stakes to engage in phantom projects revolving around hot springs, dams and such, especially with a family of children to provide for.

A scholar and teacher but not a business man, Andrew's dreams failed to materialize, one by one. As his dreams retreated, so of necessity did Sarah's. The secure, well-ordered and stimulating life of a college administrator's wife were no longer for her. Her disappointments were swallowed up in the next pressing problems and the next challenging tasks - LaVerkin - Hinckley - Star Ranch failure - the lowly home on Jordan River - the red-brick house on South Main Street. One of the most unhappy and anxious periods of Sarah's life was when their young, teenage son Luther disappeared from home and was gone nearly two years. His safe return brought joy and a closer cementing of family ties. In her remaining years, Luther tried to make things up to his mother in every conceivable way possible. Are not our greatest blessings sometimes channeled through the gates of sorrow? Sarah saw her husband's security disappear, his health break, his plans fail - but never his drive and determination. Though she did all she could to help him control his diabetic condition, he failed to cooperate when out of her sight. No matter, his sudden death at age sixty-two and a
half was a terrible shock to both her and the children. Margaret, their last born, writes:-- <span id="page-510"></span>"Mother was faced with raising us children who were still at home with hardly any provided funds. We were all made to realize the severity of the problem and from the day we laid our father to rest, there wasn't much childhood left for any of us."

Not long before his death, Andrew had done some work for a firm in California; from this Sarah received $300.00. This, together with some lots up Emigration Canyon, were all the financial assets Andrew left to her. Sarah had long since
turned to her sewing skills to supplement their income.  Edythe was married. Wendell and Sheldon, having returned from their missions which she had financed by that sewing, were now on their own, as was twenty-year-old Luther. With her two remaining daughters, Lucile and Margaret. Sarah faced the world and faced it bravely. She had earlier borrowed money for the down payment on a large old home on South Main Street, not far from the red-brick home they had rented but which had been practically sold out from under them. Luther helped with the further financing of this place. In fact, all her children were helpful and wonderful to her in her widowhood. In this new location she had continued her sewing business and upon Andrew's death she added to her income by boarding and rooming teachers from the nearby high school. The two younger girls helped with this.

"Sarah's veal cutlets and lemon meringue pies, her freshly painted rooms with airy curtains and snowy white linen, her yard with its varied blooms and well kept garden, gave these people a feeling of home away from home, and they
appreciated it. And although her days were long and demanding, often continuing late into the night, she never left her girls for outside employment. Instead she took time and energy to walk with them the mile to Liberty Park or ride the streetcar to the end of the line 'just for fun'. On Saturday nights, part of Sunday's dinner was prepared, best clothes pressed and polished and the house left in spotless order. The next day, the week's problems and struggles were laid aside and the beautiful, <span id="page-511"></span>reflective spirit of the Sabbath was kept. It was then Sarah attended church and read to her girls, or tried to, though she inevitably nodded and dozed; and they, sensing her need for rest, were left to revel in the peace of the day.

Sarah worked up quite a business making Temple clothes, for which there was much demand. But after many years with her sewing and several with her boardinghouse, her eldest daughter, Edythe, became seriously ill. By mutual agreement
Sarah and her two youngest daughters became a part of Edythe's household in order to help in the care of her five small children. Edythe had poor health for years, during which time her mother managed her household in the efficient way she always had her own. But it was a worry for her to have Edythe down so much. Part of a letter written by her sister-in-law, Millie, to her daughter Gladys at Christmas time 1943 tells something of this: "...I went to the hospital yesterday - took Aunt Sarah with me. Edythe had another serious operation six weeks ago and as yet no one except her family are allowed to see her. Aunt Sarah said they had taken the nerves from her spine - she seems awfully worried about her."

"From the early days of her marriage Sarah was a participating member of the Relief Society and many times served as its president in her locality. No means are available to measure her humanity through this organization, in visiting,
service, giving and sharing with people in need. More readily observable, however, was her lifelong trait of personal giving. From her gardens, kitchen and sewing room came the gifts for her generosity - the bouquet of flowers, the spicy pan of rolls, or the embroidered pillow cases that always had a way of finding the new mother, the shut-in, or the grandchild.

"While home and Sarah were nearly synonymous, her mind continually sought the new, the young and exciting, the current. She studied the fashions and kept her wardrobe abreast of the day, within the bounds of her maturity. Her most welcome visitors were her grandchildren and their friends, who spoiled her with gay gifts and delighted <span id="page-512"></span>her with their chatter of ski trips, school challenges, and romance. Though her eyes were poor in later years and a magnifying glass was used to aid her vision, she scanned the daily papers, following the course of astronauts, the campaigns of politicians, and the flow of general news. From these she formed positive opinions which she candidly discussed with those around to listen. She was a faithful and informed voter and a regular church goer, always prepared on the assignments to be handled. She kept her mind young and alert.

"Throughout life, Sarah exhibited a love for adventure and daring. As a young wife she relished the many travels with her husband, undaunted by the inconveniences of her small children; at seventy-two she accepted the challenge of chaperoning a granddaughter on her year of study in New York City and while there kept their apartment, prepared their meals, served as Manhattan Ward Relief Society Counselor, and audited an American literature class at Columbia University. At age eighty she accompanied a daughter's family on a ten day camping trip and took an active part in camp cooking, picture taking and sight seeing. At eighty-six, though she then walked with a cane and her hands trembled, her eyes still sparkled as she went places and did things people thought impossible for her; for example: Solicitous of her health, it was suggested that she 'skip' attendance at Provo High's performance of 'The Merchant of Venice', of which a granddaughter was student director, because this involved a hundred miles of night travel. But she made the trip and her greeting to the young girl was, 'Susie, I didn't let you down!' Such was the self discipline, active humanity and courageous daring of the old yet young Sarah B. Christenson, who crossed the time bridge between pioneer era and space age with both mind and spirit in step."

Her daughter Edyth and husband Dr. Burtis, had long since provided Sarah with lovely quarters adjacent to their own, and she remained a part of their household until well into her eighty-ninth year. Then Edyth was stricken with a heart attack and was no longer able to look out for her mother. <span id="page-513"></span>Sarah was sent to be with Luther and his wife in California. But she missed Salt Lake City so was returned there and placed in a "Guest Home", where she was given a room with her own furniture and treasures about her. She passed away shortly after that, 23 Apr. 1966, at age eighty-nine years, seven months and fifteen days. Her funeral was held 26 Apr. 1966 at 12 noon in the East Millcreek Stake center and her burial took place the same day in Provo City Cemetery beside her husband.

## JOSEPH "C" CHRISTENSEN

Joseph, third son of Laurs and Else K.
Christensen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah
Tuesday 7 Mar. 1871. He was christened plain
Joseph, but in early manhood he assumed the middle
initial "C" which he seldom ever used, and changed
the last part of the original spelling of his surname
from "sen" to "son", unofficially however. When
he was going on four years old he and his father,
mother and two older and one younger brother
moved a few miles southeast from Gunnison to
North Mayfield, where they joined in the "United
Order" experiment. When the "Order" dissolved
the family moved across Twelve Mile Creek to
South Mayfield and his father bought a home there.
This home is still standing and in good condition (1968).

Joseph received his first lessons in reading,
spelling and numbers at his mother's knee, while
she was spinning, weaving, knitting or doing other
household tasks. He first attended school in South
Mayfield and excelled as a student.

Accounts of him and his brothers roaming
the hills there, swimming in Twelve Mile Creek,
riding their Indian pony, helping on their father's
farm and even raiding the Bishop's watermelon
patch, are given in earlier pages of this book.
Fishing was another thing he enjoyed in Mayfield,
and visiting nearby Indian camps to wrestle with
young Indian boys his own age. He was a strong,
well-built young fellow. There were cold winters

<span id="page-515"></span>
in Mayfield when their stock died and difficult
times when the family had little to eat. But there
was always plenty of love and kindness to go around
in his family and very little squabbling.

The family moved back to Gunnison when
Joseph was nine years old (1880) and he was baptized 
a member of the L. D. S. Church there later
on that year. His Danish mother wrote about this
in her journal:-- "Joseph Christensen, f&oslash;d (born)
den 7 March 1871 i Gunnison, d&oslash;bt (baptized) den
25 July 1880, af (by) Thomas William Hansen og (and)
Konfermeret (confirmed) af P. W. Blom, samme
dag (same day)." Of all of Laurs and Else Christensen's 
sons Joseph was perhaps the most consistent in his 
attendance and activity in the church.
Possibly it was because his work didn't take him
away from home as much as the others. However,
he was of a rather solemn and determined nature.

Joseph attended grade school in Gunnison.
He had an experience with one of his teachers one
year, of which his brother Albert writes, (This
took place in early spring of 1888):-- "My brother
Joseph, who was just older than I, looked after
the firing of the stove at school with my help. It
was our duty to have the school rooms warm in the 
mornings and during the school days. That school year
was especially short for the two of us. Joseph and
two other boys about his age, Frank Metcalf and
Arthur Johnson, had broken some rule of the
teacher, Oscar Berglund. Perhaps it was a
failure to be properly prepared or something of
that sort. By way of punishment they had been
ordered to copy a certain number of pages from
a certain book before going home from school.
These pupils apparently had some understanding
between themselves that they would refuse to write
the verses. I hadn't been advised by Joseph that
he would not write the verses, so I remained on
the school ground to wait for him. The teacher
had a large ruler, or stick, which he used to
support his authority. He was a man of more than
usual determination and this was perhaps the first
time such determination had really been put to the
test.

"The teacher first went to Metcalf, as I was
<span id="page-516"></span>
later told, and gave him the choice of taking a
licking or writing the verses. Berglund was a big
man and he had a big stick. As he stood there with
the ultimatum to write 'or else' it was too much
for Metcalf; he commenced to write. When Johnson 
was confronted with decision after having seen
the surrender of his ally, he also commenced to
write. The teacher was wise in not taking Joseph
on first, for when he was given the alternative he
refused to write. 'Hold out your hand' the teacher
commanded, Joseph's hand came out without hesitation.
There were three vicious whacks! Joseph's
hand remained out but the teacher turned and walked
to his desk. Joseph took his hat and his books and
started for the door, and as he walked past the desk
he threw the school keys down. That was the end of
that school year for both of us.

"We notified our mother that we had quit
school. Notwithstanding her urging us to go back
we stood firm. She didn't belabor or command us
but said, gently and firmly, 'You will then grub and
burn the greasewood on the north of the forty.' This
we proceeded to do in spite of the development of
blistered hands and sunburned faces and necks."
This must have been double punishment for Joseph
since he usually liked school so much. He loved to
learn and during his leisure moments one seldom
saw him without a book in his hands.

The summer of 1889 or 1890 Joseph and Albert
worked on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad
which was being brought into Sanpete County. They
secured jobs with one William Harris, a contractor
who had a contract to construct the grade between
Sterling and Gunnison. Mr. Harris finished his job
in Sanpete County early in the summer and moved
from there to the vicinity of Eureka. After his
outfit moved, Joseph and his brother got jobs from
a man by the name of Crandall, who had a contract
finishing the grade south of the Harris job. They
ran scrapers, drove teams and were somewhat
looked down upon at times by the hot-headed Irishmen 
who operated the big drillers and shovels. But
no matter; the money they earned was used to
further their educations.

Joseph worked in summers but in winters he
<span id="page-517"></span>
went to school. He graduated from the Gunnison
Public Schools with high honors and then took a
preparatory course at the Snow Academy at
Ephraim, Utah. It became his ambition to achieve
a high standing in the educational world and to this
his efforts were devoted. His mother went to Denmark 
the early fall of 1890 to see her people, and
that winter Joseph attended the Gunnison Seminary
which was-sponsored by the L. D. S. Church school
system. In the autumn of 1891, with two brothers
and a sister, he entered the Brigham Young Academy 
at Provo, Utah, where they hoped to obtain
their college degrees. All four of them - Andrew,
Albert, Elsie and Joseph - eventuatly graduated
from there.

It was in Gunnison that Joseph first met Roxie
Bartholomew of Fayette and later they both attended
Snow Academy at Ephraim and the Gunnison Seminary 
at the same time. They became very interested
in each other. Roxie, together with her younger
sister Sarah, also attended B. Y. A. at Provo the
winter of 1890/91. It was here that Joseph's and 
Roxie's courtship flourished andi blossomed, almost
within the shadow of beautiful Mt, Timpanogos.
Roxie was an efficient little dark-haired, 
round-faced miss of English descent, while Joseph was a
bit-over-six-feet tall, blond, curly headed youth
of full-blooded Danish extraction. Now today it is
fashionable to be descended from the early Vikings,
but in those college days the greatest insult one
could give a fellow was to call him "a great big
Dane" or "a great big overgrown Swede", or so
we have been told. Nevertheless, Roxie fell in
love with Joseph, Danish heritage and all, and the
two were married Sept. 6, 1893 in the Manti Temple.
This was the first of three marriages between the
Christensens and the Fayette Bartholomews. Later,
Roxie's younger sister, Sarah, married Joseph's
older brother Andrew, and still later the girls'
younger brother Alma married the boys' oldest
sister, Elsie.

Following Joseph's graduation. from, B. Y. A.
(later B. Y. U.) he first taught school in 
Centerfield, but lived in Gunnison near by. Here he
rented two rooms in the Bardsley home, corner of
<span id="page-518"></span>
First North and Second West. This home is still
standing (1968) but now unoccupied and dilapidated.
It was here that their first child Harold was born,
21 Oct. 1894. Likely Joseph's mother Else, who
lived close by, assisted as midwife at that birth.
Roxie always had a hard time having her babies.
She had two more little ones while they were then
living in Gunnison. The first of these, little Roxie
Irene, lived only six weeks (6 Nov. 1896-18 Dec.
1896) and the second, Royal Milton, a month and
eleven days (14 Jan. 1898-25 Feb. 1898) (There
is some confusion now among various members of
the family as to the exact dates of these two births
and deaths - more research should be done.)

Joseph's next teaching assignment, following
the births and deaths of these two babies, was in
Redmond. Harold wrote of this in his history:-- "My 
first recollections, as a real small child of
about five years, were in Redmond, Utah, a very
small town in Sevier County about ten miles south
of Gunnison, where both my father and mother
taught school. I remember trying to keep up with
the older boys of the neighborhood while playing
'Follow-Jack' and trying to jump a wide ditch, as
they did. I would get wet and then would get my
legs whipped with my wet stockings that had buttons
on the top, and that didn't feel so good.

"The next winter the folks went over to Vernal,
Utah in the Uinta Basin to teach. They loaded our
belongings in a large buggy and we started out by
way of Salina Canyon. I don't remember how many
nights we camped out but the morning after the first
one, father was sure someone had come in the
night and turned our buggy around. Of course it
wasn't the buggy but father that was turned around,
but he wouldn't admit that he was wrong. He made
me a 'flipper' while on that trip. After two years
of teaching in Vernal we went back to Gunnison to
stay and father became principal of the public
school there."

Another baby was born to Joseph and Roxie
that first winter back in Gunnison. But little
La Faun, born 27 Feb. 1901, only lived two and a
half months and then passed away, 13 May 1901.
Thus they had lost three little ones straight in a

<span id="page-519"></span>
row and all were laid to rest in the Gunnison Cemetery. 
Though infant mortality was much higher in
those early days than it is today, still this must
have been most disheartening to this couple and
they must have begun to wonder if they would ever
have another child to raise besides Harold.

Joseph soon had their first very-own home
built in Gunnison and they were able to move in
sometime before their fifth child and second daughter, 
Ruth Ellen, was born, 7 Oct. 1902. (Details
of her birth appear in another chapter.) Harold
remembered well when that house was being built.
They were then living part of the time in Fayette
with his Bartholomew grandparents, but he used
to come in from there and play about, jumping and
sometimes stumbling over the rubber hoses with
which the workmen were watering down the cement
and, as he said, "getting into mischief in general".

This house is still standing in Gunnison (1969)
and from the outside appearance, still in good 
condition though changed some. How well I remember
going there with my parents as a youngster, or
again with father on his way past there to our
Gunnison Ranch. Uncle Joseph and Aunt Roxie had
lots of cows, horses, pigs, chickens and even
turkeys on their place and plenty of milk, cream
and eggs for any use. There were heaps of corn
on the cob and fresh tomatoes in season, for they
always had the best of vegetable gardens, and
there was often chicken soup with dumplings, made
the Danish way. Aunt Roxie was a splendid cook
and so friendly and "chatty". Uncle Joseph, if he
were home, was usually sitting in a big chair
reading. He seemed to me to be a man of few
words, but when he spoke it was with wisdom and
deliberation. My younger sister, Cousin Ruth
Ellen's age, thought him overly stern for he
sometimes got after them for making too much
noise, or doing this or that. But then, perhaps
Ruth Ellen and Ellen Elaine needed a little "telling"
on occasions. My, how they used to pound on that
piano!

Though Joseph may have seemed stern to
some at times, because of his sober and deliberate
way of speaking, yet he was by habit most loving
<span id="page-520"></span>
and kind, not only to his family, friends and associates 
but to the less fortunate as well. His son
Virgil remembers their mother Roxie telling about
how good their father always was to the many
Indians that came through Gunnison begging in
those early days. He never turned them down but
always gave them flour, meat, fruit, potatoes, or
anything else he had on hand. He was also very
generous and considerate of the Japanese people
who often worked for him on his farm west of
Gunnison, raising sugar beets, etc. He built
them a farm house on his land by Rocky Point,
in which to live.

Beneath Joseph's somber surface bubbled an
ever-ready "dry wit", much like his father's.
Virgil tells a story that is typical of 
this:-- "Joseph went down town to a movie one night in 
Gunnison and slept through the whole show. When he came
out he asked the manager, Mr. Duggins, for his
money back. Duggins of course wanted to know
the reason and Joseph said, 'If a show isn't good
enough to keep a fellow awake it isn't worth the
money.'"

Joseph never neglected his church duties.
The early Gunnison Ward records show that he was
born 7 Mar. 1871; blessed 6 Apr. 1871 by Jens
Jensen; bapt. 25 July 1880 by Thomas Williams
and confirmed the same day by F. W. Blom;
ordained a Deacon, then a Teacher and finally a
Priest in the Aaronic priesthood, the latter being
7 Jan. 1893. Other L. D. S. church records
indicate that Joseph was ordained an Elder in the
Melchizedek priesthood 3 Sept. 1893 by James
Jensen; ordained a Seventy 21 Nov. 1893 by 
Brigham H. Roberts, and on 10 Aug. 1902 he was
ordained to the office of High Priest by George
Teasdale. The same day he was set apart as
Second Counselor to Bishop A. C. Madsen in the
Gunnison Ward bishopric. In 1903 he was ordained
a Bishop and set apart to preside over the Gunnison
Ward as its fifth bishop, This calling he filled well
for nine years. Later he became a member of the
Gunnison Stake High Council and also an active
member of Gunnison Stake High Priests quorum,
and was serving as that organization's class leader
<span id="page-521"></span>
at the time of his death. 

Joseph Christensen (son) was also very |
prominent in the civic affairs of both Gunnison and
Gunnison Valley. He served as Gunnison's Mayor,
or Town President as it was then called, for two
terms of two years each. It was during his tenure
of office, Sept. 1909, that Gunnison obtained the
franchise making it a third class city. About the
same time the Gunnison water system was created.
In December that year a law was passed limiting
the tax allowed in the area to the valuation of the
property. In March 1910, also while Joseph was
Mayor, the electric power company brought lights
to Gunnison. His was a productive administration.

Some of Joseph's other public services
included being secretary to the Board of Directors
of the Gunnison Valley Bank; secretary for the South
Sanpete District School Board; secretary of the
Gunnison Telephone Company; a member of the
Board of Sanpete County Commissioners; president
of the Sanpete-Sevier Beet Growers Association;
and head of the Gunnison Valley Swine Breeders 
Association. Indeed he held many public positions
of trust during his lifetime, for he was a worker
and he loved to serve.

Joseph owned a fine farm east of Gunnison.
He had a nice three-room house with a front porch
built on this farm to house an occasional overseer
or laborer and his family. In fact we understand
it was first built for a Danish emigrant cousin of
his father's, her husband and two daughters, when
said husband, Niels Jensen, was given employment
there by Joseph. Harold eventually took over this
farm and told about it in his history:-- "Before
being married I had worked with father on the farm
during school and in summers. After Herma and I
were married we first lived in town, but moved to
the farm Jan. 1919 when our first baby, Cloyd,
was six months old. We raised sugar beets, sheep
and cattle." Today that east farm is still in the
Christensen family, being owned by Harold's son,
Keller, and now one of the finest cattle farms in
the area. But Joseph owned and developed other
farming land around Gunnison Valley and, according
to his son Myron, it was one of his greatest
<span id="page-522"></span>
ambitions to be able to give to each of his sons, in
turn, a productive, well-stocked farm of his own,
as he had done Harold.

However, Joseph's main work during the
better part of his lifetime was school work, and
how he loved it. He was in the classroom, either
as a student or a teacher, for forty-five years.
During that time he studied much of the time to
keep abreast of things. It has been said that one
seldom saw him sit down without a book in his
hands. Truly, he was a great reader, student and
teacher as well, for from his early youth it had
been one of his great ambitions to achieve a high
standing in the educational world, and to this he
had devoted much of his time.

He gave up the classroom sometime near the
period that ended the First World War. He had
decided to go forward in the direction of another
ambition, that of developing and stocking his other
farms with a view to getting them in order for his
boys yet in the home. This done, he undoubtedly
planned to settle down to some of his own personal
projects and begin to realize his dreams for himself 
and Roxie. There was a great feeling of speculation 
in the air then. People were venturing
financially on all sides. War prices were still on
and things looked rosy ahead. Joseph decided to
feed lambs on quite a scale for the then excellent
market. He borrowed thousands of dollars to buy
them. He also invested in some hogs, in hopes of
benefiting there also. Harold said that his father
figured that if he were successful in this venture
he could retire from his labors by the time he was
fifty-five and then spend his time doing the things
he himself longed to do.

But Joseph never realized this ambition for
the bottom fell out of everything and the market
crashed. Instead he lost heavily. This was a
great blow to him from which he never quite
recovered. Nevertheless, he turned over his
much-loved home and some other property to his
creditors and moved his family to the "Rocky
Point" farm house he had earlier built for some
Japanese. Roxie made it as comfortable as
possible, Here they continued feeding a few sheep
<span id="page-523"></span>
and hogs, as well as a flock of chickens, in hopes
of making some sort of a "come-back". Joseph
engaged in a number of projects, one of which was
organizing a Swine Breeders Association to help
step up the quality and price of hogs. Indeed he
did all he could to get things going for them 
again - but he was terribly discouraged.

The youngest son, Don, who was then about
five and unaware of the real situation, tells something 
about this period in his own history, as
follows:-- "At the time of my birth the family was
residing within the Gunnison City limits but my
recollections of the home there are vague. My
first clear recollection of home is of the farm
house down below Rocky Point, a mile or so west
of Gunnison. Of this place I have many fond
memories: - father working in the garden, helping
mother with the chickens and around the house; me
exploring the hills in the neighborhood, riding
horseback, playing in the sand dunes and helping
on the farm. I remember helping with the pigs,
Chester Whites they were, and when the creek of
water just above our homestead would start to dry
up and water was no longer running in the Sanpitch
River below, it was my job to salvage and carry
enough water from the creek to keep the hogs
relatively content. I have a vivid recollection of
those hot summer days - the buckets that seemed
always too large - and the thirsty livestock."

Marvin well remembers helping his father
feed lambs there at Rocky Point, both before and
after this ill-fated venture. He said what his
father lost was not a staggering amount when compared 
with the money available today, but then in
those hard-to-get-money days, thousands of dollars
was a fortune when you lost it and enough to change
the course of all their lives. He himself was in his
later teens at the time and had been working hard
at the project, with his father, and looking forward
to owning a farm of his own. This failure was hard
on the young as well as the old.

Life went on at Rocky Point nevertheless and
the experience drew the family closer together.
This is not to say that there were never any little
family squabbles, however, Virgil tells a story
<span id="page-524"></span>
his mother used to tell of those days which might
be called, "There's more than one way to skin a
cat". She and Joseph had decided that they should
have some trees on their place there at Rocky
Point, but for the life of them they couldn't agree
on where to plant them. Finally Joseph just went
ahead and planted some where he wanted them and
Roxie let him go ahead and do it and said no more
about the affair. But then she went outside after
that for a little while each day, when Joseph wasn't
around, and gave each of the newly planted trees a
real good shove. Roxie always ended this story by
saying, ". . . And do you know - not one of those
trees ever grew!"

We passed that place near Rocky Point the
summer of 1967. There were no trees standing
there and in fact not the slightest indication that
even a house had ever stood there. It was a dry
and barren place. Harold was with us and pointed
out the spot where his folks had lived some forty
years or so ago - but only rocks and dirt were there.

Joseph grew more quiet as the days went by
and also somewhat listless. It was evident that he
was not entirely well; yet he kept plugging along
and complained little, if at all. Then, about the
forepart of July 1926 he came down with an extreme,
though then undetermined, illness which took him
to his bed right away. He seemed to know then that
he was nearing his end. Roxie must have realized
it too. She said that in this last illness Joseph's
mind was so clear that he could figure out the
answers to problems that had perplexed him for
years.

As his daughter Ruth Ellen sat by his bedside
grieving one day, he told her that death was like
waking on a warm morning in June - and he did so
dislike winter! And when he was very, very ill
and close to death and his brother Andrew stood
beside his bed, he told him that he had been close
enough to death, in that last illness, to know what
was coming; and he likened death unto "meeting
a morning star".

Joseph died in the farmhouse near Rocky
Point, 23 July 1926. Strange to say, he was exactly

<span id="page-525"></span>
fifty-five years four months and sixteen days old
when he finally retired from his life's labors.
Some said he died of a broken heart, but Myron
said it was thought to have been a bursted stomach
ulcer followed by a number of complications and
ending with pneumonia. He was buried in the
Gunnison City Cemetery 25 July 1926.

His funeral, held on the above date, was well
attended by people from all walks of life. Many
had been his students or co-workers. Here,
among the many other tributes, were read two sets
of resolutions of respect, one from the officials
of Sanpete County and the other from the High
Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake. 
We quote them in that order:

"Whereas, there has been lost to Sanpete
County one of the members of the Board of County
Commissioners who has devoted not only his labor
and his energy but also his mind and heart to the
doing of tasks imposed on him and voluntarily
assumed by him; Whereas, the nature and character
of the services rendered by Joseph Christensen to
the public in the many capacities in which he has
served were such as to reflect credit on the entire
community and be a splendid example for all
employees to admire; be it

--Resolved: that we, the officials of Sanpete
County, desire to express officially our admiration
for Joseph Christensen, as a man and as a public
servant; and as a token of our respect and esteem,
that a copy of this resolution be spread upon the
records of Sanpete County and that a copy be presented 
to his family. Be it further Resolved, that
we offer our sincerest condolence to Mr. Christensen's 
family in this hour of their bereavement."
(Respectfully submitted, dated and signed, by
Geo. E. Cook, Chairman. }

"Whereas, in the wisdom of our Heavenly
Father, our Brother and class leader, Joseph
Christensen, has been called from this sphere of
action and advanced to a higher sphere where his
splendid talents and powers will not be limited;
and Whereas, his departure has left a vacant place
in the High Priests Quorum which will be hard to
<span id="page-526"></span>
fill; therefore be it Resolved: that we tender to the
bereaved family of our departed member our
heartfelt sympathy and call their attention to the
great work their father is now beginning, the union
on the other side and the welcome he will receive
from relatives and friends who have gone before;
and be it further Resolved: that a copy of these
resolutions be given to the sorrowing family, and
also that they be placed upon the records of the
High Priests Quorum of Gunnison Stake."

Among the numerous characteristics and
qualities Joseph had inherited from his predecessors
was a quiet, dignified and deliberate mien from his
father, as well as a handsome head of curly hair,
and a great thirst for knowledge, both secular and
religious, from his mother. He was a great theologian 
as well as scholar and he used his wisdom
and knowledge for the benefit of others. He was a
tall man. He left the world five tall sons, each as
tall or taller than he, and one lovely daughter who
has been a great comfort to all of them over the
years - and he left a wise and loving wife and
mother to his children, as well as to other children
wherever she was privileged to serve.

His daughter Ruth, in writing of her father,
says: "I feel that father's life can be best summed
up in these words taken from an editorial which
appeared in the local newspaper soon after his
death." Thus we conclude his history by quoting
that editorial supplied by Ruth:

"In the death of Joseph Christensen last week,
Sanpete County, the Gunnison Valley and Gunnison
lost one of their real substantial and progressive
citizens. And these citizens - men, women and
children - bowed their heads in sorrow and mourned
his death, deeply and sincerely. His broad mind,
his liberal thoughts, his goodness, endeared him
to all who knew him and he was held in the highest
esteem by thousands of warm friends and admirers.

"In his public life he proved efficient, honest,
and was trusted. He occupied offices of trust and
was placed there for his integrity, efficiency and
honesty; and never once was the finger of criticism
pointed at him. Joseph Christensen was a scholar
<span id="page-527"></span>
and a student. He had one aim, to reach the highest
pinnacle, and his life was taken just as he was 
prepared to start his real life's work. He was loved
and he loved all, whether Mormon, Jew or Gentile.

"A cloud of sorrow in the calling of this good
and friendly citizen will hang heavily and thousands
of friends will forever cherish his memory."

Roxie Ellen Bartholomew (Christensen) wife of
Joseph, born 30 Mar. 1872 in Fayette, Sanpete,
Utah, the daughter of John and Eliza Roxie Metcalf
Bartholomew. We are fortunate to have had the
following history of her submitted by her 
sister-in-law, Catherine Decker (Mrs. Henry L.)
Bartholomew; she titles it "Aunt Roxie" . . .
"This is the name she had for the last twenty years
of her life; people really didn't know her by any
other name, especially the youngsters of Fayette
and Gunnison. The school teachers who came to
Fayette still speak of her as Aunt Roxie. Her own
brothers and sisters speak of her as Aunt Roxie.
Her world was made up of nieces and nephews,
both old and young.

"She was born in the log house where her
parents lived the first few years after their
marriage - she was their second child and oldest
daughter. She could remember her father building
the new rock house. They moved into it before it
was finished so that her younger sister Sarah could
be born there. Gradually their new house was
finished - the parlor being completed last. The
carpet they put on the parlor floor was hand-woven.
Roxie's grandmother Bartholomew (Polly Benson)
helped her mother Eliza wash, card, spin, dye
and weave the wool of which it was made. This
parlor was a very special room, entered only on
Sundays when the members of the family were
dressed in their best and clean from their Saturday 
night baths. It was here that her father read
the scriptures; here that they knelt in family
prayers on the straw padded carpet - that was
luxury! This room was heated by a fireplace
which is still in the room at the present (1968).
<span id="page-528"></span>
The woodwork about the side and the mantle are
the same that her father John made some ninety
years ago.

"Roxie remembered their first great family
tragedy. It was the latter part of October 
1878 - she was six and a half. Her oldest brother, John,
nearly nine was very sick with 'membranous croup'.
Elder John Mellor was called to the home to
administer to and bless the child. He gave John
the blessing of health, but as he turned to leave he
said to her mother: 'Eliza, I can't tell you that
William will live.' He had reference to Roxie's
young brother, age four, who was sitting on the
floor playing and apparently in the best of health.
John recovered but in two days William was dead.
Roxie remembered their sorrow.

"When Roxie was about eight years old her
mother was making apricot jam and asked her to
see if it was cool. She tried to lift the large pan
and upset it, spilling the hot jam all over herself
from her neck down to her legs. She was badly
burned and it took a long time to heal the resulting
sores.

"Eleven children were born to that Bartholomew 
family and Roxie helped her mother as any
pioneer daughter should. She was about twelve
years old when her mother got a 'home' sewing
machine. Eliza wasn't used to this quick way of
hemming sheets so she put Roxie to it. Though
her mother tried to show her how, Roxie did it
her own way, behind her mother's back, and soon
learned all the tricks of cutting and sewing and her
mother knew she was the better of the two, child
though she was.

"Her father was Presiding Elder and then
Bishop of Fayette for many years (about forty-seven 
in all). For some time the end of the railroad 
was at the Juab terminal of York, some fifteen
miles north of Fayette. When the authorities of the
church had conference appointments south of Juab,
they would put their horses and carriages on the
train, unload them at York and drive to Bishop
Bartholomew's to spend the night, or at least rest
their animals for a time in his big barn that always
<span id="page-529"></span>
seemed to have hay enough and to spare.

"Apostle Wilford Woodruff was a favorite in
the Bartholomew home, especially with the children. 
He was asleep upstairs at their place when,
in July of 1887, a rider came from York on horseback, 
trying to find Apostle Woodruff to tell him
to come back to Salt Lake because President Taylor
had passed away. (Wilford Woodruff was then
President of the Quorum of the Twelve and 
twenty-one months later, April 1889, he was elevated 
to the presidency of the church.)

"Roxie remembered hearing of her grandparents 
being at the meeting in Nauvoo when the
mantle of Joseph Smith fell on Brigham Young.
Her grandpa had said, 'It is the Prophet. - it looks
like him - it sound like him!' He had left his seat
in the Bowery where the conference was being
held, 8 Aug. 1844, and gone around front to the
speakers' stand. He came back and said to his
wife, with great conviction, 'We will follow Brigham 
Young to the ends of the earth!'

"At one time Roxie's mother had a terrible
abcess on her neck. She had a houseful of company
from Salt Lake and the visiting Elders gave her a
blessing. Next morning, after the Elders were fed
and on their way south to their assignment, Eliza
thought of her neck. The pain was gone and healing
had started.

"Roxie met Joseph Christensen in Gunnison.
They both went to the Snow Academy at Ephraim
at the same time and then attended the Gunnison
Seminary, where she was appointed Girls' Matron.
They attended Brigham Young Academy at Provo
the same time also and here is where their courtship 
took a serious turn. They were married 6
Sept. 1893 in the Manti Temple, the first marriage
among the children of both families. Later, as we
have been told before, two others of the Bartholomews 
married two other Christensens. Roxie and
Joseph's was a very happy marriage. Nine children 
were born to this union. Three died in infancy
and were buried in the Gunnison City Cemetery.

"Ruth Ellen was Roxie's and Joseph's fifth
child and the first following the three little ones
<span id="page-530"></span>
who died, one right after the other a few weeks
after their births. Her grandmother Christensen
was in attendance at her birth, the dramatic story
of which has been given in an earlier part of this
book. Ruth was always very dear to her parents,
as she has always been to her various brothers
and their families.

"In the early years after her marriage,
Roxie always went back to her childhood home in
Fayette at Christmastime to make things happy
there. She was a jolly sort of person and such
excellent company. She always had some joke or
'Christmas treat', especially made for her brothers.

"Roxie loved to sew. She made everything - children
clothes, fancy dresses, suits, coats,
sweaters, wedding dresses, boys pants, and
numerous sets of burial clothes. She did most of
her mother-in-law Else's sewing and that for Vena
and Tresia until they left the Christensen home.
She kept Ruth Ellen looking like a little princess.
She was a master at 'making things over'. (In fact,
as Ruth Ellen said, "She was a wonderful seamstress").

"Roxie fed her big family the very best of
food. Joseph and their oldest son, Harold, used
to kill as high as fifty wild ducks in one hunt and
for the season they would supply a set number
every day to a Salt Lake market; killing, cleaning
and dressing them and putting a specified number
on the north-going train each day. Joseph and
Roxie cleaned the ducks and as they were busy
cleaning, a cake made in a big black dripper-pan
by Roxie could easily walk out of the house, a piece
at a time, in the hands of her five hungry boys.
She always had room in her house, at her table
and in her heart for 'one more' even if that one
happened to be 'ten'. Alma Fredrickson, a boy
about Harold's age who needed a home, lived at
their home for nine years and became almost like
a son to them and a brother to Harold.

"Following the death of her husband, Joseph,
23 July 1926, Roxie continued to live in their home
just west of Rocky Point with her four unmarried
sons. Myron was married the next spring, 13 Apr.
<span id="page-531"></span>
1927, and then there were just the three boys left;
Virgil 18, Marvin 15&frac12;, and Don 10. In early
November of 1928 Roxie went to Fayette to help
her brother Henry put up his fruit, his wife Ireta
having passed away late that summer leaving him
alone with three small sons to care for; Homer 7,
Keith 5 and John 3&frac12;. She never went back to Rocky
Point to live long. Soon she began to bring her
chickens and barnyard animals and her household
goods back to the old homestead and the Old Rock
House she had watched and helped her father build
in her childhood. She moved in with her brother
Henry and his boys, who then occupied the old
place."

Don tells something of this move:-- "Sometime 
after father's death we moved from our Rocky
Point home to Fayette, Utah, a distance of about
six miles. Uncle Henry had lost his wife and been
left with three young sons. He invited mother and
her family to come and live with him, they being
brother and sister, and she accepted. I recall
that my job in the moving was to take a horse and
drive our milch cow, 'Old Jerse', to our new
home. To me at the time it seemed a great
adventure and undertaking to set forth alone below
the foothills of Fayette.

"The arrangement to combine families worked
out with little friction and with great benefit to all
concerned. Mother soon became 'Aunt Roxie' to
her nephews, as well as all the other children in
town; and Uncle Henry, with his gentleness and
patience, became a second father to me." Ruth
Ellen adds:-- "Mother took her three youngest
boys and went to help Uncle Henry raise his three
motherless sons. She stayed with him twenty years;
it was the most beautiful brother-sister relationship
I have ever seen. She became 'Aunt Roxie' to
everyone in Fayette - she had so much love to give!"

Catherine continues her history:-- "Roxie
made many people happy with presents of Danish
dumplings, Danish meatballs or Danish sweet-soup, 
which she undoubtedly learned to make from
her Danish mother-in-law, Else. She could cook
mutton to a 'queen's taste'. Many of her friends
would say, 'We don't like mutton', but after a meal
<span id="page-532"></span>
at her table these very ones would say, 'What
delicious meat - what is it?' It was mutton.

"She made her own yeast and bread - cakes,
pies, butter, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese and
head cheese. She made sausage and cured hams
and bacon. Always she had a garden of wonderful
flowers and vegetables. She would have cantaloupe
enough from her garden each fall for a Fayette
'town treat.'" Ruth Ellen adds to this:-- "Always
her hands were busy. Her hoe was her cane - no
weeds could show their heads in her large garden
and live."

Catherine continues:-- "She always had
chickens to supply eggs, chicken for Sunday dinners
and 'egg money'. She stuffed them for roasting with
bread and sage dressing. She raised turkeys, ducks
and geese. She kept her youngest son, Don, on his
mission with her 'egg money'. She was always on
the giving end of life.

"Roxie was a wonderful mother to Henry's
three boys, as well as her own. It was a sad
experience for her when Henry's middle boy, Keith,
died after two operations (1937). He had always
been so kind and courteous to her. She had been
in Henry's home some thirteen years when he was
married to his second wife, Catherine Decker. She
stayed on seven more years to help mother two more
of Henry's sons by this second marriage.

"In October 1948 she moved back to Gunnison
and went to live with her oldest son, Harold, and
his second wife, Stella. Henry and Catherine
moved from Fayette back to Gunnison, 3 June 1949.
One room in their new home was designated as 'Aunt
Roxie's room', but she never came back to live in
it. She died in Gunnison Hospital 5 Jan. 1952 and
was buried beside her husband and three infant
children in the Gunnison Cemetery. Apostle James
E. Talmage once said, 'All you can hold in your
cold, dead hands is what you have given away'. If
this be so, then Roxie's hands were full enough to
last for eternities."

Aunt Roxie was indeed a good woman. For
most of the later part of her almost eighty years
she suffered from crippling arthritis, yet she kept
<span id="page-533"></span>
cheerful and seldom complained, never gave up,
neither did she let this painful affliction keep her
from her services of love. She was active in each
of the auxiliary organizations of the church in one
way or another, from time to time, besides filling
the demanding service as the wife of a busy Bishop
and life-long public servant. By far her greatest
role, however, must certainly have been that of
an understanding, loving mother and kind friend,
not only to her own children but to all who came
her way in need of tender care and affection.

## ALBERT "H" CHRISTENSEN

None can successfully dispute the claim that
Albert, like the rest of these Christensens, was
of pure Danish descent back to the fearless Vikings
of old, and even beyond. Although his parents, 
Laurs and Else K. Christensen, were transplanted
from Little Denmark to the great western land they
called "Zion", a little more than six years before
his birth, and he was born an American citizen,
still the blood of the ancient Norsemen ran strong
in his veins.

His mother recorded his birth in her journal
thus:-- "Alberth Chresten f&oslash;d den 13 Dec. 1872 i
Gunnison." So it was Albert Christen Christensen
he was named and blessed in the L. D. S. church
in Gunnison, Utah, by Bishop Joseph S. Horne, 2
Jan. 1873, when he was twenty days old. He was
his parents' only "winter" baby and the first born
to them "in the covenant".

Albert seldom used the middle name Christen,
likely given him for his grandfather, and in early
manhood dropped it altogether and assumed the
middle initial "H". Like some of his older brothers
he also changed the spelling of the last part of his
surname from the Danish "sen" to the anglicized
"son". A number of reasons may have been at the
root of this name change and we should not discount
the possibility that the disdain and even cruel treatment 
accorded many "lowly Scandinavians" by some
of the early English born Saints may have been a
<span id="page-534"></span>
factor. It was not popular in some areas of Zion,
even in Sanpete, to be a Danishman or a Swede.
In fact, a few of the early Danish converts in
Sanpete County, and elsewhere, apostatized from
the church because of the shameful treatment
accorded them by their English "brethren".
Likely none of these early English converts who
may have prided themselves on their "royal"
descent from England's great "William the Conqueror" 
knew that this same William, Duke of
Normandy, was a grandson of the early Danish
Viking Chieftain, Rolf (Rollo in French) who more
or less seized Normandy from the French king in
911 A.D. Is it not an advantage to know who one
really is?

Albert was scarcely two when his family
moved from Gunnison to North Mayfield, his
parents having joined the "United Order" experiment 
then in progress there. Here he was given
his first lessons at his mother's knee; for she was
deeply interested in education and studied to perfect 
her speaking and reading of English along with
her children. When the "Order" was dissolved
there the early spring of 1877, the Christensens
moved across Twelve Mile Creek to South Mayfield. 
It was here that Albert entered public
school for the first time, the fall of 1878, a few
months before he turned six.

When he was six and a half his mother went
to Salt Lake City to study medicine. After her
return she was away from home a great deal treating 
the sick or delivering babies. The children 
became accustomed to the sight of her brown medical 
kit, always packed and standing ready at a
moments notice, and the sound of heavy wagons
rattling up their street day or night and stopping
to pick up their mother, then rattling off again in
the direction they had come.

Following the severe, disastrous winter of
1879/80 the family sold its interests in Mayfield
and moved back to Gunnison where they lived for
a short time in a small adobe in the east part of
town owned by a relative, Lars Myrup. Albert
was then a towheaded youngster of seven and a
half and rather large for his age. His father soon
<span id="page-535"></span>
leased a farm in North Christenburg, owned by
Julius H. Christensen, and here they lived in
summers for the next several years. His father
purchased some property in northwest Gunnison
on which stood a two-roomed adobe dwelling where
the large family lived for a few months each winter
while the older children attended school in the
Relief Society Hall, about a block east of them,
which was also used for church gatherings.

A larger house, of rock, was erected near
the old one and the family used both houses to live
in for a time. Additional rooms were eventually
added to the new house and additional children to
the family, until there were nine living children in
all besides the two little ones who had passed away
soon after their births. Soon the family moved back
to Gunnison altogether and the new rock house became 
the "ancestral home" of their descendants.
It was from this home that Albert walked some
several miles to the Sanpitch River, with his
bundle of clothes under his arm, and was baptized
a member of the L. D. S. church, by John Larsen,
and dressed later behind a squawberry bush. This
was 5 Apr. 1882, when he was almost four months
past nine. He was confirmed next day in church,
6 Apr. 1882, by Samuel Lublin.

From the time he was old enough to take
responsibility Albert was given work to do in the
home and on the farm. As he grew in size and
confidence he became eager to get a job for pay.
He soon learned that working away from home for
someone else was not always what it was "cracked
up to be". Between ages ten and eleven he hired
out to one Peterson for $3 a month and board,
When he was not much past twelve he worked for
a short time for Bishop A. C. Madsen hauling
manure in a wagon with a span of contrary mules.

But a few days later another job opportunity
came to Albert. Julius H. Christensen, for whom
his older brother Chris was then herding sheep,
hired him to run a farm for him at $12 a month
and "keep". With but a few extra clothes, besides
the overalls and shirt he was wearing, he was
taken out to run an approximately 300 acre farm
in South Christenburg on which stood a one-room
<span id="page-536"></span>
log cabin with a lean-to. With only general directions
he was left to live there alone. Most of the time
that summer of 1885 he had no companions except
the horses with which he worked the farm, a mongrel 
dog who seemed to need a master, and a horde
of night-reveling pack rats as big as half grown
cats.

"Notwithstanding that my employer had the
reputation of being a hard man to work for", wrote
Albert of this experience, "I found him the opposite.
His family, consisting of himself, his wife, five
daughters and one son, was really a model family.
I was always treated with the greatest respect by
all of them. While Mr. Christensen himself
claimed to be an atheist, his family was affiliated
with the Presbyterian church in Gunnison. Without
any request on my part my employer, on two
different occasions that summer, told me I was
worth more than I was being paid. The first time
he raised my wages to $15 per month and the second
to $20. This, together with 'keep' was a high wage
for a boy of my age at the time."

Late that fall Albert went home and attended
school for some three months, which was about the
usual school year in those early farm communities.
He was in the "fifth reader" at the time. Early the
next spring he was again hired by Julius Christensen
and this time he had charge of a herd of sheep in the
mountains. He was then nearing fifteen. That late
fall he again went home and attended school for
about three months, then returned to the mountains
again in early spring to herd sheep for Mr.
Christensen.

Albert must have been a hard and dependable
worker, even as a youth, for his responsibilities
were being constantly increased, as well as his
wages. He never seemed to have trouble getting
employment. The fall of 1888 Mr. Christensen
told him that if he would continue to work for him
with the sheep he would pay him as high a wage as
any man in his employ except his brother Chris,
who was his foreman. That was $30 a month and
board; Chris was getting $35. So Albert stayed on
for another full year, or until he was approaching
his seventeenth birthday. He was often lonely in
<span id="page-537"></span>
the mountains. Trouble with Indians, cattlemen,
mired and frozen sheep was not uncommon to him.
His memories of a happy home and the occasional
visits of his brother Chris strengthened and sustained 
him.

His year's service ended, his employer again
came to him and offered to rent him a herd and
assist him in getting started in the sheep business
for himself if he would stay on with the sheep as
his brother Chris was doing. Now Albert had
always cherished the greatest admiration for his
oldest brother and this offer must have been a real
temptation to him; but he had made up his mind to
get an education so he turned down the offer and
went back to Gunnison to school.

Rather early in life Albert had dreamed of
becoming a lawyer. He said, "As a child I was
intrigued with court hearings and attracted to trials
in the Justice of the Peace courts. I believe they
were held in the school house in those days. I
happened there once when the Justice and two men,
whom I knew to be lawyers, were conducting the
preliminary hearing of a case involving grand
larceny. The lawyers were Jacob Johnson and
William K. Reid. Johnson was a man who
attracted general attention. He was rather large
and heavy set and wore a long Prince Albert coat
and silk stovepipe hat, and all in all had a most
distinguished appearance. William K. Reid, a
small man with keen gray eyes, was slightly
stooped and his right hand seemed to be withered
and useless. (Both of these gentlemen Albert was
to be rather closely associated with in the law
profession years later.)

"Jacob Johnson, with his deep voice and
measured sentences, almost scared me. His
sharp, sarcastic retorts, witty Scotch-Irish
insinuations and illustrations I found amazing and
delightful. From that time on I never missed a
Justice trial when there was one in town, school
or no school. As a result of this, or perhaps
something else beyond my understanding, I
seemed to have the firm conviction that I would
someday be a lawyer. Strengthening this intention
was my parents' confidence in me, for it finally
<span id="page-538"></span>
became known to them that despite all odds I was
going to study law. A close friend told me of my
mother's reaction when she spoke to her about the
many hardships and temptations to be encountered
in attaining and following this profession. My
mother said she had full confidence in me and knew
I would surmount the obstacles and be a good lawyer."

The autumn of 1890, when his mother went
back to visit her people in Old Denmark and search
out her genealogy, Albert entered the Gunnison
Seminary. The next fall he went to Provo, Utah
and enrolled in the Brigham Young Academy there.
A Judge Wilson was giving an elementary course
in law and Albert was attracted to this. Here he
was introduced to some of the writings of the
famous English jurist and legal historian, Sir
William Blackstone, and later bought one of his
books. He also registered for German, mathematics 
and psychology. The fine educator, Dr. 
Karl G. Maeser, was still president of the B. Y. A.
until about midterm that year, or Jan, 1892.
Albert recalled Dr. Maeser passing him one morning 
bound for his home where he had inadvertantly
left his keys. "Ven you haf your brains in your
heels", he explained in his inimitable manner,
"you must use your heels!" While there he also
played on the college football team, which was
before the days of heavy padding and helmets when
the game was really rough.

He helped to put himself through college by
working summers and teaching alternate winters.
The school year of 1892/93 he served as Principal
of the District School in the small farming community 
of Koosharem, Sevier County. The fall of
1893 he again entered B. Y. A. and continued his
studies in English, German, Latin, mathematics,
speech and pedagogy. Dr. Benjamin Cluff was
president of the Academy then.

The winter of 1894/95 Albert taught fifth
and sixth grades in his hometown of Gunnison.
That summer he worked hauling posts and poles
to fence the 160 acres of land he had purchased
from his father. He had also acquired a city lot
and several head of livestock out of his earnings.
I heard him speak of that pleasant year at home
<span id="page-539"></span>
among his loved ones. He mentioned his father as
being so wise, patient, kind and helpful. He spoke
of his mother with great affection as "the life and
soul of the home!" She then had given up her extensive 
medical practice of some fourteen years and
was taking boarders. She and Albert had many
intimate and inspiring conversations that year,
and one particular one about marriage. He also
mentioned his delicate little foster sister, Ada,
and what joy her sweetness shed in their home.
He spoke of looking forward to visits with her on
his return from school in late afternoons.

During that year he often visited his grandfather, 
Christen Christensen, the only one of his
grandparents he had ever known. He had such
great respect and fondness for the fine old Danish
gentleman. The two had much in common, including 
their love for fine horses. The older man had
raised a thoroughbred filly from birth, with Albert
in mind, telling him that it would someday be his.
Together they had watched this outstanding animal
grow and develop until she was ready for the reins.
Albert broke her and it was during that year that
he was given this mare for his own; although he
insisted on giving his grandfather a fair price for
it. He bought a smart rubber-tired buggy to go
along with his horse and when he went to Provo to
again attend B. Y. A. he drove up in style. That
rig was his pride and joy.

President Cluff also took a liking to Albert's
rig and often borrowed it during that winter of
1895/96, professing a desire to purchase it from
him and keeping it to "try out" for unnecessarily
long periods at a time. This finally provoked
Albert and he said a few harsh words to the president. 
He always felt this was the real reason that
Cluff turned "thumbs down" on his being selected
class orator for the graduating ceremony that
Spring, although he was selected by his class.
The president stated as his reason the fact that
Albert hadn't taken teachers training so wasn't
entitled to graduate. This of course was ambiguous,
since Albert had been a practical teacher of two years
experience. Albert refused to take out his degree
from B. Y. A. under those conditions, in spite of
<span id="page-540"></span>
the fact that he had the support of his classmates
and more than enough credits. We have heard the
tale about what was lost ". . . all for the want of a
horseshoe nail", including the rider. In Albert's
case, however, nothing was lost except perhaps a
bit of his pride, for he still had his horse and buggy
and all the excellent knowledge and training accumulated 
towards his graduation, as well as an
additional amount of wisdom regarding the frailties
of man.

During the school year of 1896/97, he acted
as Principal of the Levan school in Juab County.
In his spare time he indefatigably read Blackstone
and other law books and also studied history. He
had set his mind on attending the law school in Ann
Arbor, Michigan if at all possible. When school
closed he returned to Gunnison and continued to
read and study law all the time hoping that his
chance would come. Money for transportation and
tuition was his main concern. That summer he
greatly missed the ever-ready smile of the courageous 
little Ada in the home, for she had passed
away the previous winter.

Some other impressionable experiences came
to Albert about that time. He was given the opportunity 
to argue his first case before the law. It was
a jury trial and he put up a strenuous legal battle
for the defense, a citizen of Gunnison. Although
they lost the case, his client seemed well pleased
with his services and the leniency of the verdict,
as well as his fee. Albert figured the experience
was well worth the time and effort and so charged
nothing; besides it helped to strengthen his determination 
to go ahead with law - sometime - somehow.

One evening he attended the local theater to
witness a performance by a home dramatic club
from Manti. On the handbill advertising the play
was a picture of the leading lady - a Miss Virginia
Snow. Her acting impressed Albert; in fact he
became so interested in Miss Snow during the
course of the evening that he saved her picture
and placed it in one of the law books he was
studying.

The long hoped for opportunity to go to law
<span id="page-541"></span>
school came rather unexpectedly soon after. About
dusk, 11 Aug. 1897, as Albert approached home,
he was met by Henry A. Kerns, a local sheepman,
and offered the job of taking a train load of sheep
back to Kansas City. He accepted immediately,
even though he was to leave by early morning less
than two days later. He realized that this was the
opportunity he had been waiting for. He said, "My
heart was beating rapidly as I arrived home. I
told father and mother of my decision and received
their blessing.

"The next morning at daybreak I was on my
way to the Manti City Savings Bank with my horse
and rubber-tired buggy. I hoped that by borrowing
enough money to pay my tuition for the first year I
could somehow make my way through law school.
I was kindly granted a loan of $200, although I
already owed the bank $500 on my previous schooling. 
I arrived home after dark. Mother had my
underwear, sox, extra clothes and other personal
effects already packed in a telescope case. She
pressed my only good suit which I had worn that
day and packed that. At about 3:30 next morning
we left for Gunnison depot. No one except father
and mother was on hand to bid me 'Godspeed', yet
with their faith in me I was sure I would not fail."

Yes, Laurs and Else Christensen, his loyal
and caring parents, stood encouraging and cheering
from the sidelines every worthy ambition and
accomplishment their children undertook. It was
a matter of great love, but then again perhaps a
little matter of pride also. Something outstanding
could come out of Little Denmark!

So Albert went on his way east, in company
with several carloads of lambs bound for the Kansas 
City market. He had only been out of the
State of Utah once before and then no farther than
Denver. Along with him also were his telescope
case and a few law books, into one of which had
been tucked a picture of Miss Virginia Snow. He
was well prepared, however, for his schooling at
the University in Ann Arbor, and in two years
completed the regular three year law course and
secured his coveted "sheepskin". This was not
done without sacrifice, long hours of grueling study,
<span id="page-542"></span>
working after school, and without selling most of
what he had in Gunnison, including the treasured
horse and buggy, nor without deeply appreciated
financial help from his wonderful brother Chris "I."

Back in Utah the summer of 1899, Albert
"hung up his shingle" in Manti. A dream of long
standing was about to come true. And yet another
dream was in the making, for soon he was introduced 
to Miss Virginia Snow, or "Jennie" as her
friends all knew her. The two began dating and a
wonderful courtship followed. Some proud moments
came for Albert when he escourted "Miss Snow" to
his hometown of Gunnison and she presented a
dramatic, patriotic reading at the annual community
Fourth of July celebration of 1900. She was so
dainty, vivacious and talented.

Albert took Jennie to the Manti Temple, 26
Sept. 1900, and made her his own "leading lady".
Sometime in October they moved into their own
two-story brick home at 155 North 2nd West, which
Albert had been able to completely pay for and
furnish, due to his having been selected to take
care of the legal work pertaining to the settlement
of some one hundred claims brought on by the
tragic Scofield coal mine disaster.

Those were mostly bright years as Albert
and Jennie walked together through the corridors
of an exceedingly happy marriage; as they brought
forth their five beloved children; and as he became
a highly respected lawyer, County Attorney, and
finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial District Court,
comprising Sanpete, Carbon, Emery, Grand and
San Juan counties. I recall the salary was $4,000
a year - quite a sum for those days.

Those were the days when lawyers went about
their precincts in buggies, buckboards, or on
horseback with law books tied to their saddles.
During his judgeship Albert traveled by horse-drawn 
stage, train, and the automobile. Price,
the County Seat of Carbon, was then at the zenith
of its riproaring history and his calendar was
filled with many sensational criminal trials, along
with the important civil ones.

As Albert prospered he bought sheep and land.

<span id="page-542a"></span>
![Albert and Jennie](./images/45.png)
<br><br>
Wedding picture of Albert and Jennie

<span id="page-543"></span>
He went into the sheep business with his brother
Arthur, who cared for the sheep while he furnished
the capital. They lambed their sheep on Cedar
Mountain east of Salina. After lambing, about
July 1st, they would move into Twelve Mile Canyon 
for the summer months and the winter on the
west desert. Albert's brother Louis helped Arthur
take care of the sheep on the desert during some of
those winters.

Albert joined his brother-in-law, George
Black, in a small land investment in Garfield
County. He bought property from the Warren
Stone Snow estate and built the first garage business 
in Manti. One of his major purchases was
about 350 acres of land on either side of the Sevier
River west of Gunnison which he called his "Gunnison 
Ranch" and into which he put a great deal of
effort and money. Bert Gledhill says he was
working for Albert on the Gunnison Ranch when he
had the two huge barns built there and helped haul
the lumber to build them. He was also working
there when one of these big barns blew down during
a turbulent windstorm and had to be rebuilt.

On 29 Apr. 1908, Albert made arrangements
to buy 160 acres of land some eighteen miles
north of Gunnison in an area known as Flat Canyon,
and this he called his "Flat Canyon Ranch". People
came from long distances to buy the "blue ribbon
peaches" raised by some in Flat Canyon. Large,
white-rind watermelon from there received first
prize at both County and State fairs one year.
Albert hoped to make this ranch into a first rate
fruit farm and planted a large number of peach 
trees. The summers were very hot there and the
winters extremely cold, which created some
problems.

In Oct, 1910, exactly ten years after Albert
and Jennie had settled in their first home, Albert
moved his family into a lovely new home a half
block south from the old. It was not quite finished
at the time but by the next spring it was ready to
show to their friends. Fri., Mar. 31, 1911, the
Manti Messenger carried this article:
<span id="page-544"></span>
>"Dedication of Home and Housewarming <br>
Over Hundred People Entertained at <br>
Christenson Home this week.

"Judge and Mrs. A. H. Christenson entertained 
royally Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
the first a dedication and the second a housewarming 
of their new palatial residence on Depot Street.
Wednesday was the dedication and invitations were
confined to relatives and neighbors, about 35 being
present. The dedicatory prayer was offered by
J. H. Carpenter and short talks were given by
Bishop Peterson and Ezra Shoemaker. Music was
furnished by Alida Snow and Prof. Fred J. Fjelsted.
The balance of the evening consisted of games and
refreshments.

"Thursday night invitations were issued to
70, a crowd of younger people made up mostly from
the clubs. The High School orchestra furnished the
music during the early evening and, in addition to
a short program, the principal entertainment was
cards. Refreshments were served also.

"The Christenson home is an enviable possession 
and a credit to any city, built of white bricks
and with every line in quality and style of finish
noting stability. On the first floor are the reception
hall and living room thrown into one, a large and a
small dining room, kitchen and pantry. On the
second floor are a library, three bedrooms, sun
room and bath room. The reception hall, living
room and large dining room are furnished with
solid oak and the balance of the house with fir.
The entire woodwork is in natural wood stain - no
paint being used. The front door is bevel plate
glass, copper joined. The doors to the china
closet in the large dining room are of the same
material. The living room ceiling is of oak beam
finish and the furniture of the craftsman finish. A
modern basement with furnace, home cellar,
laundry, amd coal bins, complete a thoroughly
up-to-date building."

Accompanying the home were some lovely
old shade trees - a spreading walnut - weeping
willow - boxelder - and three heavy bearing apricot
trees, together with a large garden plot, corral,

<span id="page-544a"></span>

<br><br>

<span id="page-545"></span>
barn, buggy shed and small horse-run. In the
corral were always a milch cow or two, some
chickens, perhaps a few lambs, and father's
thoroughbred horses often lifting their noble heads
high over the big corral gates.

Against the backdrop of Albert and Jennie's
two homes and their numerous activities was staged
the memorable drama of the family life that we
their children knew and cherish. The scenes invite
us even now. It was at our first home that I sought
father's sheltering arms in fright at the sight of
my first bewhiskered, bell jangling "ho-ho-hoing"
Santa Claus, while my younger sister, Elaine,
stood up bravely and gave her order -- "I want
dah and dahbug". It was here we took our first
"space flights" holding tight to the long rope swing
secured high up in our poplar trees and operated - by
father's strong arms, It was here we were roused 
from our beds at midnight and lifted high in
those same strong arms to the attic window to
view Halley's Comet, a fiery ball in the sky with
a tail of stardust trailing behind. It was father
who allayed our fears that with the coming of this
comet the world would end, as people were saying.

It was with father as guide that we rode in
saddlebags through the dense forests to the sheep
camp and trembled at the bear stories told by the
herder, Tillby, as we went along. It was later,
with father's consent, that we romped over the
hills of giant wool sacks at the shearing corral in
Christenburg. It was with him we first picnicked
at "Devil's Ribs" and roamed Temple Hill in
search of "Indian Eyeballs". It was he who baited
our hooks as we fished for sunfish at Funk's Lake,
or for carp at Nine Mile Reservoir at sundown.

Father drove the hayrack in which we crossed
the river wheel-deep at Gunnison Ranch to gather
redberries and with him we watched the long legged
killdeers wading there and listened to their shrill
bird cries at eventide. It was with him holding
the lines that we rode in the buggy with "Stride On"
in the harness on so many happy little trips to see
our Danish grandparents, or through the west
fields in search of sagebrush for mother to brew
for hair rinsings, or merely to discover the first
<span id="page-546"></span>
wild rose of spring for her.

Father cautioned us to watch out for rattlesnakes 
at Flat Canyon as we picked peaches,
fished salamanders from the water cistern, or
wandered up the canyon of odd shaped rocks nearby,
whose formation resembled giant cooking pots all
turned topsy-turvy, so aptly called "Hell's Kitchen".
With father we took our annual birthday trips by
train or stage to Richfield, Price and other places
he held court. He drove when we took our first car
rides, I sitting in the bottom of the back seat of our
new Buick eating salty soda crackers to keep from
getting "car sick".

It was at the new home that we sat with him
and mother in the shelter of the broad front porch
and watched battles of the elements in the heavens
as "Thor swung his great hammer in a rumble of
thunder" or "Odin flashed through the sky in his
chariot of fire". There was nothing to fear when
father was near. Here we sat in the living room
with the firelight from the fireplace reflected in
the polished floors and colonnades, while mother
read to us and father peeled apples or cracked nuts
for our enjoyment. It was here we waited breathlessly 
at the bend of the staircase for the grate-fire
to be prodded into blazing, the wax candles to be
lighted on the Christmas tree, and for that most
thrill tingling sound of all - father's "Well, well,
well, it looks as if Santa Claus has been here after
all!" As if there was ever any doubt of it at our
house.

It was at the San Francisco World Exhibition
the summer of 1915 that mother, Elaine and I were
shepherded around so expertly by father through
the maze of beautiful buildings, exhibits, museums,
courts, parks and statuary, with the "Tower of
Jewels" looking down over all and pigeons, pigeons
everywhere, which we often fed. There were so
many things for our wondering eyes to "drink 
in" - people from all over the world in their native
costumes - ex-U. S, president William Howard
Taft with silk topped hat, tails and a fancy cane
among them. With father we stood hand in hand
on the broad steps of the "Court of the Four Winds"
and listened in rapture to the chains of silver sound
<span id="page-547"></span>
rising up from the immense amphitheater below,
as the great John Phillip Susa's band gave a stirring
concert. We heard Utah's own Emma Lucy Gates
sing the Star Spangled Banner on "Utah Day" (July
24) at the Fair. It was on this trip we caught our
first sight of the Pacific Ocean and witnessed our
first and only traditional bull fight in Tijuana,
Mexico.

A happy childhood is like a radiant jewel
sparkling on the more somber chain of life - its
beauty never dims. This was one of our priceless
legacies. During those years, father was our hero,
our protector, our Knight in shining armor. We
never found cause to fear him nor to doubt him,
for he truly loved us. Our home was a sanctuary
of joy and peace, where laughter, story telling and
music played a big part.

Father and mother had some choice friends
in Manti during those years - Hattie and Chris
Axelson, May and Haze Clark, Eloise and E. D.
Sorenson, Delphia and Quince Crawford, Millie
and Halburt Kerr, Alice and Dilworth Wooley,
Kate and Warren Snow - the L. R. Andersons,
J. H. Hornungs, Ray P. Dyrengs, E. T. Reids,
Ellis E. Johnsons, Frank Alders - I'm sure I have
missed some. Most of the ladies belonged to the
Manti Literary Club and the men to the Commercial Club.
Their most intimate friends joined
them in a "500 Club". They had wonderful times
together.

But there are varieties to living, and happiness
does not always endure. In the early evening of
Monday, 27 July 1916, in the Covey Apartments
in Salt Lake City, five people surrounded the bedsside 
of Jennie Christensen - her life had just
ebbed away. Her aging father, Joseph Snow, stood
on the right, with stooped shoulders and eyes cast
down in grief. Her sister, Retta Neff, knelt beside
him shaken with sobbing. Father stood on the left,
bending close to the pillow where mother lay. I
knew his heart was breaking but he did not 
weep - outwardly. I stood near him and held her limp,
outstretched hand in both of mine; somehow my
fear of death vanished at that moment. Then father
rose and put one arm around me - "We must go on
<span id="page-548"></span>
together without your mother", he said gently - "We 
must be brave." Childhood took leave of me
then and never returned. Father was never quite
his old self again after that either.

Albert continued to serve as District Judge
until his term ran out in 1917, but declined to stand
for renomination although both parties indicated a
desire to place him on their tickets. His duties as
Judge necessitated long absences from home and
he felt he needed to be near his five motherless
children. So he brought his energies back to the
private practice of law, the running of sheep, the
operation of his two ranches plus some semi-private 
business projects.

After Jennie's death his sister Vena came
into the home for a time to assist him. Then
Jennie's sister, Retta Neff, came to help and
brought her children while her husband was away
studying for his doctorate. Occasional hired girls
followed but proved to be poor substitutes for a
mother. Sometimes of necessity the children were
left to carry on alone - but not often. After nearly
four years of this, Albert found a wonderful helpmate 
in Miss Myrtle Farnsworth, the Domestic
Science teacher in the local High School and a
younger sister of Ida, lovely wife of Edgar T.
Reid, who lived neighbors across the road.

Albert and Myrtle were married in the St.
George Temple, 23 June 1920. She was almost
thirty-five and he was forty-seven and a half. His
children lovingly called her Aunt Myrtle from then
on and she had an outstanding influence for good on
their lives from the beginning. Albert was then
tied up in a huge land investment known as the
"Starr Ranch". Myrtle understood about it before
their marriage, since Albert had told her that if
the venture succeeded, all would be wonderful, but
that if it failed he would be literally "wiped out".
Myrtle was willing to take the chance.

Albert's brother, Andrew, had interested him
in this venture, a large ranch in Juab County north
of Nephi, the possibilities of which, to Andrew at
least, seemed enormous. Though Albert was not
as enthusiastic as the less conservative Andrew,
<span id="page-549"></span>
yet he had let himself become involved when an
organization was set up among three major stockholders: 
Andrew (A. B.), his brother-in-law, Otis
L. Ercanbrack, and Albert (A. H.), with a view to
purchasing livestock and real estate on a large
scale from the Starr Land and Development Company.

With A. B. as president of the new company
and A. H. as secretary, a special meeting of stockholders 
had been held 24 Nov. 1919 in Nephi, where
the following resolutions were unanimously 
adopted:-- "Resolved to buy said property from the Starr 
Land and Development Company, the cost to be paid as
follows: Total price $130,000 with $35,000 down
in cash, the assumption of a $20,000 mortgage to
the State of Utah then carried on the property, the
balance of $75,000 to be assured by three promissory 
notes, one for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1920,
another for $10,000 due on Dec. 31, 1921, another
for $55,000 due ten years from date of purchase,
with 6% interest overall - and in addition, the crops
raised and harvested upon said land during the year
1920 to be mortgaged as future security for the note
due in 1920, and the 1921 crops mortgaged to secure
the note due in December of that year." So the deal
had been made and became valid and binding upon
all concerned.

This proved to be the most disastrous step
Albert ever took. Being at the height of the 
post-war boom of World War I, these stockholders were
not spared when the post-war depression followed
shortly. Albert was forced to mortgage all he
owned to try and keep things going, as well as to
borrow all additional he could. Lastly, he was
forced to turn over his lovely home and most all
else he had to his creditors, and besides was left
under a staggering load of debt which at the time
must have loomed as impossible for him to surmount.

In August of 1925 Albert and his family
loaded up their remaining belongings and moved
to Provo, Utah. Phillip, almost fourteen at the
time, tells of this move:-- "Then came the move
from Manti to Provo. It was made with two hayracks, 
Uncle Arthur Christensen driving one and
<span id="page-550"></span>
my brothers Sherman and Hale the other. I rode
with them as far as Salt Creek Canyon and then got
tired of the whole transaction, for we burned out a
boxing and had to camp for a day or two until we
could get a replacement. Father came along in the
old car and took me into Provo where he had taken
Aunt Myrtle and the rest. He had arranged to rent
a house in northeast Provo but it wasn't ready when
we got there so we stayed for a few weeks with some
of Aunt Myrtle's relatives; first the Ashworths and
then the Abner Tanners until our house was ready.
They were wonderful to us.

"We lived about nine months in Provo and
then father bought an old home on an eight acre
farm from M. B. Cutler, who had two wives, each
deaf and dumb and living in separate homes. When
we first looked at this old home, the Mrs. Cutler
who lived there lovingly patted the furnace, about
the only modern thing in the place. Aunt Myrtle
soon made it look and feel like home however, and
later an inside bathroom was installed and other
improvements made. Here we had rows and rows
of raspberries and strawberries, cats and cows,
and an old horse, Molly, who pulled the cultivator
for us through the rows of berries. Father and I
planted fruit trees, apple, peach and cherry,
together with a large garden."

It was no small task for Albert to reestablish 
himself, start a new law practice with
few contacts and very little backing and to build a
career, almost as from the beginning. Though past
middle age and heavily weighted down by debt, he
found sufficient reason to go on fighting. Perhaps
it was his Viking blood that urged him. Even
though his debts ran into many times ten thousand
and more, he resolved to pay back every dollar.

There was seemingly no end to the sorrow
and additional expense he was called upon to endure
those next few fateful years. On July 23, 1926 his
brother Joseph passed away. Sept. 4, 1927 his
sister Emma died. The next spring there was
much illness among his loved ones. His elderly
father was suffering untold misery from diabetic
ulcers; his father-in-law was in bad shape with
cancer and his son Hale was in constant distress
<span id="page-551"></span>
with a then undetermined illness. Albert divided
his limited time among them, doing whatever he
could for each. His father-in-law passed away
3 Aug. 1928 in Salt Lake City. Albert was on hand
when the end came and again at Manti when last
rites were conducted for the fine old gentleman,
Joseph S. Snow. Nov. 10, 1928 he was called
from Hale's sickbed to the deathbed of his own
father, L. M. C. Christensen, who was laid to
rest a few days later in the Manti cemetery and
whose suffering had been long and heart-rending.

Hale had been operated on that mid-July but
this failed to disclose the trouble or cure it. However 
a second operation near mid-October had
revealed his condition to be grave. After that he
never left the L. D. S. Hospital in Salt Lake City
until his death of internal cancer, 9 Mar. 1929.
Albert wrote of this:-- "This morning at 5:40 a.m,
our dearest Hale passed away - that same wonderful 
boy that he has shown himself to be throughout
this terrible but unequal struggle. While my heart
is grieved beyond words, I thank God that his awful
ordeal is over. His has been an example that should
help us all to carry on properly under all conditions.
His memory to me will be a staff for whatever may
befall us. I am proud to be the father of such a boy."

A little past five months after Hale's death a
baby girl, their third and last child, was born to
Albert and Myrtle. They called her Kathryn and
she brought a ray of bright sunshine from without
the gloom. But the sorrows went on. Before
Kathryn was a week old, Myrtle's beloved sister,
Ida Reid, was crushed to death in a car accident.
Myrtle held up bravely but there were still more
partings for her to endure. A bolt out of the blue
came with word of her father's passing, the last
of November 1931. Myrtle's mother came from
Beaver to live with them then, but exactly one 
month after her husband's death, the sweet little
old lady was killed by a fall at the home in Orem.

In between these last two deaths, on 17 Dec.
1931, came word of the unexpected passing of
Albert's brother, Andrew, all alone in a strange
hotel in St. George, Utah. The grim reaper made
yet another call on Albert's loved ones when less 
<span id="page-552"></span>
than a year later, 4 Dec. 1932, his brother Arthur
passed away after surgery. Some seem to be
tested more than others at times and Albert was
one of these. His cup of sorrow must have been
near to running over during those difficult years.

By then the country was in the midst of the
great depression. Banks were closed, jobs were
at a premium and many people were hungry.
Though Albert had all the legal business he could
handle, and more, collections were hard to make
since most of his clients had little available money.
Nor was his health the best, for the strain and
pressures of recent years had begun to take their
toll. Above all was the fact that he was still
heavily burdened by debt. He had worked almost
night and day, and his family had worked and saved
and gone without along with him, with but one end
in mind - that of freeing him from debt. Friends
had advised him to take out bankruptcy - many were
doing it. He flatly refused although at times
pressured almost beyond endurance by some of his
creditors. He was in dead earnest about paying off
all of his obligations with interest, as soon as time
and circumstance would permit.

During the long, hard pull, his home, his
beloved family, his small fruit farm, together with
his great faith in a Divine Power, were his strength
and his refuge. Indeed he couldn't have continued
the struggle without these. He couldn't have gotten
along without Myrtle, who managed his household
so expertly and with such courage and kindliness.
The way she stood by him, giving hope and encouragement, 
will be forever to her credit. He couldn't
have managed without the love and cooperation of
his children and the pride and satisfaction he had
in their accomplishments. He looked forward to
family associations - birthday parties - picnics - hunting 
and fishing trips - reunions - just daily little
visits - but especially the glorious Christmas Eve
family home evenings in which everyone took a
special part and which were never neglected as
long as he lived.

His daughter Kathryn writes of his later
years:-- "Dad was fifty-six when I was born. By
the time I was a teenager he was sixty-nine and
<span id="page-553"></span>
when I reached college age he was seventy-four.
We worked out a fine relationship. I always thought
of him as loving and kind, but the characteristics
I remember most were his great dignity, scrupulous 
honesty, and his pride in us children. I
remember him saying on occasions when his family
was all gathered around him that he could not conceive 
of Heaven being much more wonderful than
this.

"I remember serious talks with Dad, and I
recall the loving way he'd take my hand and would
rub my thumb and knuckles in a circular movement
of his large thumb. He placed constant emphasis
upon us being more than just "scrub" or common
run-of-the-mill. Somehow he managed to make us
children feel that we had an obligation, because of
our heritage, to be contributing, worthwhile members 
of society. He would not compromise on the
kind of school grades he expected. I usually left
a list of my grades on the mantlepiece where he
put his car keys and under which he always carefully 
placed his high topped shoes at end of day.
If ever there was anything besides an "A" on that
list, no matter how many "A's" there were, he
would say, "Well, let's see if we can do a little
better next time."

"Most of my life I felt that it was necessary 
to be very careful financially, although I know that
by the time I began to grow up things were easier
than earlier. There always seemed enough money
for music lessons and schooling however. All Dad
asked in return was that we take advantage of these
opportunities. He wanted us to develop our talents
to the fullest. Countless times I have been grateful
for the fine education he was willing to provide for
me.

"I can still remember the look of joy on my 
parents' faces when Dad came home from the office
sometime during the last of World War II to tell us
he was finally out of debt. His honesty, integrity,
courage and determination have been a great
inspiration to me and helped me to understand that
there is little in life that cannot be faced successfully 
in the long run, if these characteristics have
been developed within. As the giver of gifts of life
<span id="page-554"></span>
that were most meaningful and precious our father
was most generous and gracious.

"I remember Dad as a man of the soil. From
early spring to late fall he and mother would rise
around 5:00 a.m. He would work in the garden until
7:00, have his breakfast, and then prepare to leave
for the office by 8:00. He would often spend around
two hours in the garden again after his full day at
the office. His loving care showed in his gardens
and orchards. They were beautiful to behold, and
kept a never failing supply of fresh vegetables and
fruits on our table all summer and fall, with plenty
for mother to bottle for use during the rest of the
year. His ability with the irrigation water seemed
magical; mother said it seemed like water would
run uphill for Dad. Helping him plant corn,
potatoes and beans are rather special memories to
me and family fruit-harvesting-parties were the
"greatest".

"Some of the more humorous aspects of life
with Dad always cause a chuckle within my heart.
Dad did enjoy driving nice cars! The first car I
remember was a green 1936 Plymouth which pulled
our housetrailer all over the United States for our
vacation in that year. The next was a blue Chrysler
Highlander with red plaid and leather seat covers.
This was the car I learned to drive and used so
much. When it came to getting a new car in 1947,
Dad said in mock seriousness that he was going to
get a Ford. When the time came for the debut, he
chose a Sunday morning. He took mother and me
to Sunday School in the old car and then went to
get the new. When Sunday School let out, there
was Dad out in front of Lincoln High School, where
our ward held church then, in a brand new 1947
Lincoln with push button doors and windows.
Picture if you can all the men and boys of the ward
crowded around that gorgeous car! Finally, as
mother and I were able to get through the crowd
and into the car, Dad found he couldn't get it
started. So many people had tried the battery-powered 
windows that the battery had gone dead.
A substantial amount of glory vanished amid calls
of "Why don't you get a horse?"

"It was in the Lincoln that Dad, mother, a
<span id="page-555"></span>
granddaughter, Colleen Keeler, and I drove back
to attend the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia the summer of 1948. Dad was an
official delegate from Utah to that convention which
nominated Thomas E. Dewey for the U. S. Presidency. 
Dad was a lifelong Republican and it was
quite a blow when he and Dewey awoke to find that
Harry Truman had won the election. There were
so many other Republican defeats during those
years that election day, until Eisenhower's victory,
was always followed by a time of gloom at our
house. To me, Dad was "Mr. Republican of Utah"
and I feel that our nation would be better off if
there were more as sincerely and vitally interested
in politics as he."

The proud Lincoln car came to a rather
unceremonious end. The Provo Herald of Friday
June 4, 1954, carried the story:-- "Judge and Mrs.
A. H. Christenson, Orem, and two grandchildren
narrowly escaped death late Thursday when their
car overturned in a canal. The car rolled over
two and a half times and landed upside down in
Carterville canal. Mr. Christenson, 81, was
pinned against the floor of the overturned car.

"Mrs. Christenson, seeing the outstretched
hands of one granddaughter, Kay Webster, as she
clung to the front car seat, hauled her through the
water filled top of the car, which rested on the
bottom of the canal, and up to air and light. She
pushed the button, rolling down the car windows,
and helped the little girl out onto the canal bank.
Still a prisoner herself, she helped the second
little granddaughter, Sue Webster, to duck under
the water and up out of the window. However, it
was impossible for the two older persons to get
out of the half submerged car without aid, so she
urged the drenched children, shivering on the bank,
to call for help. An unidentified motorist stopped.
One boy in the car assisted Judge and Mrs.
Christenson in freeing themselves and the other
drove off to get help.

"The grandchildren, daughters of Reed J.
and Norma C. Webster of Salt Lake City, had just
arrived for a vacation with their grandparents and
the four were on their way to Provo Canyon for
<span id="page-556"></span>
supper. Thick branches helped to cushion the fall
of the sedan as it sank into the stream."

A lovely new 1954 Buick replaced the Lincoln
in Albert's garage. This was his last car. His
very first car had also been a Buick for, if
memory holds true, he owned one of the first if
not the first Buick in Manti. Though he was without 
a car off and on during the years when things
were so difficult, most of the cars he had were of
the best. Fine cars were some of the very few
personal extravagances Albert ever allowed
himself.

Kathryn adds:-- "Dad had been an excellent
and safe driver. Driving and feeling independent
were of course very important - so important to
him that perhaps he drove too long. I recall how
he 'revved up' the motor there on the south side
of the house in Orem, and then the inevitable
honking and screeching of brakes as he entered
upon Highway 91 with considerable determination.
One of the frustrations of his last years was when
the authorities would no longer renew his drivers
license. The boys came for him lots towards the
end of his life and the Buick remained in the service
shop from time to time."

One by one each of his three living sons
joined his law firm and began to handle more and
more of the load, leaving Albert added time for
recreation. He spent more time digging around
in his small fruit farm, played a little golf and
chess, and evidenced a special weakness for "Five
Hundred." This latter he often indulged when his
children and their companions dropped in of an
evening. Many lively contests of skill were held
with the family gathered around the dining room
table, and with Aunt Myrtle usually ending up
bringing in a plateful of her famous "caramels"
to treat both winners and losers.

Albert loved to be out in the mountains. He
went deer hunting almost every fall with his boys
and others, during which time he got "nary a deer."
Most folks said it was because he hadn't the heart
to shoot the poor things, but his son Phillip said
this just wasn't so - his father was just a poor shot.

<span id="page-557"></span>
But all this was before that "special hunt" of which
Phillip tells;-- "Father was nearing eighty when
he and a son-in-law, Dan Keeler, and myself went
on a deer hunt southeast of Strawberry. We arrived
on Willow Creek Ridge shortly after daylight and
parked our car. I shot my buck within minutes.
Dan walked out along the ridge and down into a
little draw covered with brush, tossing small rocks
and twigs on either side as he went. Suddenly
antlers appeared in the brush ahead of him - one
quick shot felled the two pointer. Coming back up
onto the ridge Dan met father. 'Do you want to get
a deer'he said. 'Sure' said father. Dan instructed
him to go down into another little draw nearby and
gently throw rocks and twigs, as he had done.
Father disappeared into the draw as I joined Dan
on top the ridge. We were standing there talking
of our successes when - 'Bang! Bang!' came from
the brush below - then all was still. I shouted,
"Have any luck?' In a minute an excited answer
came back; 'I sure did and he's a WHOPPER!'
We three mighty hunters returned to Orem with
our three bucks and father's four pointer topped
the kill. It was his first and last. This was a
great day for father."

There were many "great days" for Albert in
his later years. They were great days for him
when he saw his children graduate from college;
when he saw his daughters taking part as "leading
ladies" in operas, oratorios and dramas; when he
saw his grandsons serving foreign missions for
the Church. June 26, 1954 was a great day for
Albert for he saw his oldest son, after having
been nominated by President Eisenhower and
confirmed by the United States Senate, sworn in
to fill one of the highest judicial offices a Utahn
could hold, that of Federal Judge of Utah. It was
a great day for Albert when he himself, together
with Myrtle, was able to return to the beautiful
St. George Temple, this time to work for the
salvation of the dead.

Sherman writes:-- "Perhaps one of the
richest parts of father's life was as he and Aunt
Myrtle established a new home in Orem, as he
became one of the leading trial attorneys in the
<span id="page-558"></span>
State and its recognized authority on irrigation law,
and in this new setting a venerable citizen,
honored, respected and revered."

Sometimes when I went to father with my
problems he would listen carefully and then,
instead of giving any particular solutions, would
merely counter with the question, "Are you a
thoroughbred or a mongrel?" I then knew what I
must do, though the doing be hard. He expected
much of his children but he demanded far more of
himself. He had little patience for mediocrity in
those who could do better but for the weak his
sympathy was endless.

Father was a tall man; tall in character as
well as stature. He was a man of self-restraint
and great dignity. Yet his dignity was tempered
with a kindness and humility that would stoop
unseen to place a silver dollar in the hand of a
wistful child. During most of his mature years
he was on the "giving end" of life. Not half his
charities have ever been told. To me he was a
thoroughbred in every sense of the word.

It must have been another great day for
Albert "H" Christensen when, Mar. 13, 1957,
his spirit took flight. So many must have been
waiting "over-there" to greet him - his beloved
wife Jennie - his dear son Hale - his cherished
parents - his brothers and sisters, together with
the kind Chris "I" of whom he had dreamed so
vividly not long before. Surely his grandsire
Christen Christensen must have been on hand,
along with others of his worthy ancestors. Think
you some of the more ancient of these may have
been among the welcomers - those who once rowed
or stood commanding at the helm of high-masted
Viking ships with carved wooden dragonheads
pointing the way?

Kathryn writes:-- "I was married and living
in the east when father died, three months to the
day following his eighty-fourth birthday. He has
remained in my memory as the vigorous, spirited
man that he was the last time I saw him in life. I
arrived home just in time for his funeral and to see
him, as if peacefully sleeping, as I had seen him

a thousand times or more in years gone by.

"All his later life father dreamed of going
to Denmark. In fact he at one time even began
making serious preparations for such a trip. He
had instilled in us children a pride in our Danish
heritage. It may be that I was the first of his
descendants to see that beautiful country in his
stead (1959). How proud he would have been to
see that Lovely Land. How proud I was when I
saw it. And how proud I am of him."

first wife of Albert "H" was born 28 Jan. 1878 in
Manti, Sanpete, Utah. She was the fourth child
and second daughter of nine children born to Joseph
Smith Snow and Lucy Ellen Van Buren, early Mormon 
Pioneers of English and Dutch descent.

A history of her life is included in the volume,
"Cheney Garrett Van Buren and His Family", published 
by this writer in 1962. Others have written
about Jennie S. Christensen and all are agreed that
she was an unusual and outstanding individual.
Albert, writing of his first meeting with her,
states:-- "There seemed no doubt in my mind
from that first evening but that she would fit
completely into my hopes and life. She had taught
school, attended the University of Utah, was very
intelligent and possessed a grace that greatly
appealed to me. Our visits became regular and
increasingly agreeable to both of us and it was not
long before we became mutually convinced that life
together was promising and inevitable."

Elaine describes her thus:-- "She was small
of stature, but she walked like a queen; her eyes
were large, blue and misty, but searching and
appreciative; her hair was dark and rich, curling
the way nature wanted it to; her mouth was sweet
and provocative, but spoke wisdom and truth; her
hands were small and square, but tender and
creative."

Mr. Prestwich, who was stage manager at
<span id="page-560"></span>
the Moroni Theatre, commented that Jennie Snow
had the most beautiful speaking voice he had ever
heard and could have been the top actress of her
day had she not preferred marriage to a career.

Sometimes, when sleep eludes me, I fancy
I see mother Jennie as she lived and breathed
among us. 'Tis strange what childhood impressions
linger. I seem to feel her many moods and to be
swept along in the circle of her activities. The
pictures I see are quite vivid. I never see her
angry, but I see her fearful - fearful when our
horse runs away, tipping the buggy over and
throwing the four of us into the mud, just before
her third baby is expected, and little Elaine, filled
with her own wee worry, cries and points to her
muddy shoes, demanding, "Take doz off!" I see
mother fearful of childbirth, for she is small and
her babies are large and there is little modern
medical knowledge to assist her - her own mother
died in childbirth. I see her fearful when little
Sherman, who is what they call a hemophiliac, gets
the nosebleed; fearful when father, exhausted from
a hard day at the herd or ranch, goes to sleep in
the bathtub and shakes the place with his snoring
while she, sure he will drown himself, pounds
frantically on the bathroom door and tries to pick
the lock, as we children all take up the pounding
and shout to try and wake him.

I see mother happy and busy at sewing with
us children taking turns threading the machine for
her. I see her stencilling borders of acorns, tulips
and other motifs on scrim for bedroom curtains
for the "rose-room" with its solid mahogany furniture,
the "blue room" with its birdseye maple, and
the "buff room". I see her deep-frying timbale shells
and chicken croquettes for parties and openhouses
and making dainty little nutbread and boston-brown
bread sandwiches and letting Elaine and I help trim
off the crusts.

As we come downstairs on cold winter mornings, 
I see her benevolent as she spreads steaming
hot, nourishing breakfasts on the small kitchen
table for some of the local less-fortunates. In
summers I see her giving generous "hand outs" to
roving tramps, gypsies and Indians. Though they
<span id="page-561"></span>
are only roomers, she sends trays bearing tasty
breakfasts up to the blue-room for two out-of-town
lady school teachers with whom we are sharing our
new home one winter - because they can find no
other place to stay.

I see mother sitting patiently in a chair near
the Baldwin piano, counting out the time, over and
over again, as I practice for my piano lesson.
"Sing the little verse that goes with this piece,"
she says; "I would like Professor Woodward to
see how well you can play and sing together." So
I practice and she sings along with me in her rich
contralto. "Sing robin from your woodland tree;
Sing robin, sing a song for me; I love your pretty
melody; sing little robin, sing." She kisses me
as I leave for my lesson. "Play and sing your
best", she says. At the studio Mr, Woodward is
entertaining his sweetheart and I feel hesitant about
singing. Yet I seat myself at the piano and begin
to play my piece and sing, as mother has told me.
"Just play the piece and skip the singing," says
my teacher rather sharply. I go home to dear
mother, crying and indignant because it seems he
has insulted her. "Never mind," she says; "someday 
we'll show Professor Woodward just how lovely
you can sing."

I see mother patient with girls she has hired - skinny 
little Miss Lazenby who eats up all the leftovers 
saying, "Eat 'em to save 'em," and Venice,
who gets sick so much that mother is forever having 
to wait on her instead of the other way around.
Good hired girls are so hard to find yet so much
needed to help with our big new house.

I see her without a hired girl and with father
away, weary at the close of day yet bravely trying
to wrestle all four of us children at once as she
gives us our Saturday night baths in the twin sanitary 
tubs in the basement; Hale and Sherman in one
tub, Elaine and I in the other. One or the other of
us keeps getting turned head over heels in those
deep, slick tubs and comes up from the water
gasping and screaming. I see her giving us our
supper later in the kitchen and making our favorite
"Lumpy Dick" as a last resort, and serving it hot
with extra sugar.
<span id="page-562"></span>

I see her basking in the joy she finds in our
lovely home - in the big dining room with brown
embossed leatherette fabric on the wainscotings,
papered scenes of forests in colors of green, brown
and gold on the walls above and "blue willow" china
plates on the plate rails. She often steals away
here for a moment to write and we children know
just where to find her. She loves the small east
window on the second landing of the stairway,
whose crystal prisms cast rainbows of color from
the sun's first rays or the beams of a rising moon.
How often we stand together and watch the full
moon through that prism-bordered window.

I see mother ill and hardly able to walk
though still courageous, after the birth of little
Phillip, staying upstairs in the Rose-room or
being carried downstairs in the strong arms of
father. I see her struggling to regain her health
by faithfully taking "Susanna Schowcroft's Physical
Exercises", which she orders by mail; I see her
powdering the backs of her hands to soothe the
clusters of tiny itching red blisters which are
aggravated by both heat and water and forerunners
of the acute Bright's disease that is eventually to
take her. I see her embarrassed by the sores on
these same precious hands, so covering them with
gloves whenever she goes out in public.

But mostly I see mother Jennie as the
talented, creative, enthusiastic and wonderful
woman all who really knew her remember. Her
vibrant, outgoing personality radiated courage and
faith and a deep love for all of our Heavenly
Father's creations. As Elaine wrote, "Jennie
loved everything beautiful: the sighing of the wind
in the elms, the chirp of crickets in the hush of
evening, the raspy rustling of corn in the shock,
the changing panorama of clouds in a ribboned sky,
the lyrical rippling of waters, the consonant music
of nature, or the dissonant music of life." In fact,
Jennie loved life. Though she was very human her
spirit seemed to soar above the clouds of ordinary
living and was able to take others with it to some
degree, especially us, her children.

Even from the beginning, her vivid imagination 
and power of poetic expression made the things
<span id="page-563"></span>
about us live and tingle in our minds and hearts.
She gave us new eyes, new ears, new understanding. 
And while she entertained and delighted us,
she taught and disciplined in poetry, song and
story. She ran the gamut of noble emotions from
the simple to the sublime, and we followed along.
She tuned the strings of our creative impulses and
made them want to sing!

Her children's stories were unforgettable
and had their settings in places familiar to our
experiences. The one about the "Two Little Mud
Girls", Dottie and Pearl who came to life, might
easily have taken place in the garden and barnyard
of our first home, for here were chickens, currant
bushes, often toadstools that came up after a rain,
Madsen's unfriendly pigeons that roosted in our
barn, stray cats, our granary next to the barn
that was plagued with mice. Uncle Gard and Aunt
Esther Snow's white ducks that swam in the big
irrigation ditch between our two yards, and plenty
of nice, clean, soft dirt for making mud pies. "Be
careful little mud girls - the world is very big and
you are very little," said the friendly chicken to
Pearl and Dottie; but the advice was really for little
Elaine and Virginia, given by their loving mother.

"Longshanks and Tockadoo" could have been
set in our old barnyard. Sometimes even now,
when I'm tempted to brag, I think of the rooster
Tockadoo and his bedraggled tail feathers. The
story of "Old Thunder and the White Cloud" must
have had its setting in the old County Block, not
far from our home. "Two sisters and a Prince"
brought forcefully to mind the old adage: "Beauty
is as beauty does".

"Old Santa Claus", a happy Christmas adventure 
in verse, was made up by mother for me to
give at a school Christmas program when I was
around nine; in fact, the Christmas we first spent
in our new home. She dictated the last part of it
to me while she was mixing bread the morning just
before the program. She helped me memorize the
poem within the hour, with appropriate gestures,
emphasis and inflections. For more than fifty
years since then her descendants, to the third
generation, have retold this Christmas poem at as
<span id="page-564"></span>
many Christmas Eve family home evenings. Her
beautiful Christmas song, "One Christmas Day",
for which she composed both words and music, has
also been given by her descendants on numbers of
such occasions.

It was some time before she wrote "Old Santa
Claus" that mother began training Elaine and me to
sing and dance and do dramatic skits together. As
I remember, our initial public performance was in
"Bobby Shafto", a sad tale in song, which we presented 
in conjunction with a Stake Primary Carnival
in the Manti Tabernacle. A friend, Maud Ewing,
took the boy's part and Elaine and I were the two
sisters. Aunt Retta Neff rushed into town the day
before the performance, bringing beautiful old 
fashioned bonnets and long, full dresses for Elaine
and me to wear. We were asked to repeat "Bobby
Shafto" at a later date and our cousin, Reva Riddle,
took the boy's part then.

For several successive years after that
Elaine and I were featured on yearly money raising
variety shows put on by the Primary in conjunction
with the local picture shows. Each year our names
and pictures in costume appeared on bulletin boards
outside the theatre; they seemed to think our acts
were some sort of "drawing cards." One year we
were a Dutch couple with appropriate costumes and
real wooden shoes. We sang "Lena, my Lena
Smidt" and did a noisy Dutch clog. Another year
we were an Indian couple and still another we were
a couple of village "rubes" singing "Mornin' Cy,
Howdy Cy, Gosh darn Cyrus but you're lookin' spry."
Then we locked arms shoulder high in the latest and
most daring fashion and did a ragtime dance that
brought the house down. Mother certainly knew
how to put a song and dance together and what she
didn't know Aunt Retta could add.

I always remember mother looking her very
best whether at home or in public. I never saw
her untidy, unless occasional errant curls straying
over her brow could be called such. When she went
out in public with our tall father as her escort she
liked to appear as tall as possible. Then she pinned
her curls high on top of her head and topped them
with a bob fashioned from a switch she had hired
<span id="page-565"></span>
made from her own hair combings. She wore the
highest heels she could buy on her small 
two-and-a-half size shoes, which had to be special ordered
through the local merchants. I seldom saw her in
bright colored apparel, for she most always wore
the darker shades of brown, gray, blue, green,
and of course black. Perhaps this is why I remember 
so well the dress she wore on that last New
Year's Eve when she attended a dinner dance with
father. It was an evening gown of softest salmon
pink satin with long, fitted skirt and elbow length
sleeves. Over each shoulder ran several narrow
pink satin straps, each centered with a small black
satin button. I stood on a chair beside her with
needle and thread and tacked the straps in place to
please her. Long, black silk gloves completed her
costume. Mother looked so beautiful to me that
night. Seven months from then she was in her
grave.

"Aside from the memory of that wonderful
woman," Sherman writes, "time has left us nothing
more closely touching her character and very being
than the fragments of her soul which she placed
upon paper. In her children's stories she brought
two little mud girls to life, not to mention the
animals and birds and flowers that she translated
into mortality for the delight of young minds. In 
her more serious poems she caught the most profound 
undertones of humanity and religion for the
delight of the soul. (Included in this category is
"The Wise Man," which won for her first place in
the Deseret News Christmas poetry contest of
1910.) Between the two, in verse and story, she
has woven a golden mesh of love and devotion,
courage and pathos, romance and happiness for
the delight of the heart." May we share two of
her lovely poems?

"A Toy, A Little Shoe, and Memory"

>One childish shout brings back the dead days sweet - <br>
A shout now wafted on the summer air <br>
Rolls back the years and brings the days once fair,<br>
And I can hear the patter of his feet, <br>
And I can hear his shrill, commanding calls.... <br>
There stands my boy in wee blue overalls. <br>
<span id="page-566"></span>
Time was those shouts brought angry words and tears <br>
And muddy, tracking feet received a frown,<br>
And clinging, restless fingers soiled my gown. <br>
But those same feet went marching with the years <br>
Until they marched away; the tearing hands <br>
Are doing worthy tasks in foreign lands. <br>

> The years have turned to music those shouts wild, <br>
I'd give the world if I could feel them now - <br>
His baby fingers, fondling o'er my brow. <br>
Oh years! Why did you rob me of my child <br>
And leave a half-worn picture book to me. . . . <br>
A toy. . . A little shoe. . . And memory?

"Song of a Soul"

> Out of the vast eternity I came <br>
And from thee, Lord. <br>
I, that was free, by flesh and blood am bound, <br>
Bound at thy word. <br>

> While through the mystery of life I grope <br>
Where is there balm <br>
Save in the memory of that vast home <br>
Which bids me calm? <br>

> And in the prison walls of flesh and blood <br>
I sing my song. <br>
I dream my dreams - poor, chained, rebellious dreams <br>
Which fade ere long. <br>

> I shall be free when all that is of earth <br>
Beneath the sod <br>
Is laid; then back to the Eternity <br>
And thee, Oh God!

It has been more than sixty years since Jennie
Snow Christensen sang her songs and dreamed her
dreams, yet her songs and dreams continue to live,
but especially in the hearts of us, her children. I
am sure I myself have fallen far short of her expectations, 
yet the memory of this precious mother has
sparked some of my noblest efforts, humble though
they have been. She made her limited life one of
boundless giving of the beauty of her spirit, like a
<span id="page-567"></span>
delicate white blossom sending forth such beautiful
and lasting fragrance as to almost defy description.

Myrtle Farnsworth Christensen, second wife
of Albert "H", was born 30 July 1885. She could
be proud of her heritage for all four of her grandparents 
were early Utah Mormon Pioneers worthy
of note. Her maternal grandfather, Marcus
D'Lafette Shepherd, whose father had been an
aide-de-camp to General George Washington
during the American Revolution, became a
member of the Mormon Battalion, was in on the
gold rush in California and panned gold at Sutter's
Mill. Returning to Salt Lake City he presented his
sweetheart, Harriet Editha Pharish, with a sack
of gold nuggets as a wedding gift. They settled
first in San Bernadino Valley but later sold their
property there for a goodly sum of money and used
this to buy machinery with which to set up a woolen
mill in Beaver, Utah, where they were called to
colonize by Brigham Young. A cotton mill in
St. George and a shoe factory in Parawan were
set up about the same time by others.

Myrtle's paternal grandfather, Philo Taylor
Farnsworth, who migrated to Utah with the early
Saints in 1848, was immediately called to go back
to Winter Quarters with wagons and supplies to
assist in bringing destitute saints to Utah. Again
and again he made these trips and on one of them
met a young English convert, Margaret Yates.
He helped her to come to Zion, where they were
wed. The couple were sent south to Fillmore,
Utah to help settle that place, but later, in 1856,
Brother Farnsworth was called to Beaver to become 
Bishop there. Myrtle's father was then but
a young child. Her grandfather became a polygamist 
and had four wives and thirty children.

The Farnsworth and Shepherd children grew
up together in Beaver. The Farnsworths had many
struggles trying to feed and clothe their large
family, but were enterprising and hard working.
The Shepherds were considered well-to-do and
their children were given every advantage. In
<span id="page-568"></span>
1866 Brother Shepherd built the first brick home
in Beaver, a huge eighty by thirty three-story
dwelling modeled after the Prophet Joseph Smith's
home in Nauvoo. It was long called "The Shepherd
Mansion". He also built a brick granary nearby.
Among the furnishings in this home was a large
grand piano which the Shepherds secured when
Fort Cameron was abandoned by the U. S. Soldiers.
It had been brought in for the wife of the Fort's
Major and was said to be the only such piano in the
valleys then, except the one owned by President
Brigham Young.

When Myrtle's parents, William Henry Farnsworth 
and Harriet Susanna Shepherd, were first
married they lived in Beaver for a while where her
father worked first as a telegrapher and then in a
store. He then homesteaded some farming land
about nineteen miles north of Beaver at what was
known as Pine Creek Ranch. Here in the ranch
shack of logs Myrtle was born, the fourth of seven
children. When she was two and her new baby
brother was six months, their father left on a
mission to England for the L. D. S. Church. Her
mother and the five children went to live in the
Shepherd Mansion, where grandfather Shepherd
took care of them for the thirty months Myrtle's
father was away.

During his absence grandmother Shepherd
died. Upon her father, William Farnsworth's
return, he and his wife and family were given the
large home and grandfather Shepherd went to live
with his polygamist wife a block away. Myrtle's
father was made manager of the Beaver Woolen
Mills and served as such for the next five years.
The large home was remodeled to better fit the
needs of the Farnsworth family. Though several
bedrooms occupied one wing of the second floor,
a large recreation hall 50 by 30 ft. occupied the
other. Community meetings, programs and dances
were held here. The old brick granary was turned
into the city jail for a time. Many's the tale that
could be told of those days.

Myrtle's mother had several sisters and they
and their families flocked back to the old home on
many occasions. Myrtle and her sisters and cousins
<span id="page-569"></span>
had free access to the large attic and their grandmother 
Shepherd's trunks of beautiful clothes and
bonnets she had brought across the plains, as well
as to the old spinning wheel. Many were the home
dramatics held by candlelight in that old attic.
Myrtle's mother's family was a singing family and
all used to sing around the table following a family
meal in the huge dining room. Her mother, Harriet,
and her Aunt Sadie often accompanied them on their
guitars.

Early day Beaver was very educationally
minded and prided itself on its good spellers,
grammarians, mathematicians, as well as singers.
The small town was blessed with excellent music
teachers. This, together with native ability and
training in the home, was an advantage to Myrtle
and her brothers and sisters and they all sang well.
Myrtle can hardly remember when she couldn't
sing alto. She joined the Ward choir when in her
early teens - they all did. Later her brother Karl
sang in the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir for years.

Myrtle grew up in Beaver among her four
sisters and two brothers and cousins by the dozens.
She was a healthy, pretty girl, rather large for
her age, and with an inner urge towards tomboyishness 
which she felt was very distasteful to her prim 
little mother and sedate older sisters. She
had an optimistic and happy nature and a generous
heart and she was loved by many.

At that time most of the Farnsworth family's
clothing was made from Woolen Mill products, or
from cotton cloth they traded for from the cotton
mills in St. George. Every garment was
remodeled and passed down as long as there was
anything of it left. The family shoes were secured
by trading woolen goods from their Beaver mill
for high button shoes made at the Parawan Shoe
Factory. Though they may have thought these
shoes ugly and ill-fitting, it was their patriotic
duty to wear them nevertheless. Though fundamentally 
plain in her tastes, Myrtle longed for
pretty clothes, and her first pair of "real store
shoes" was an experience she treasured with
happiness.
<span id="page-570"></span>

She attended the first four grades at the
Beaver District school in the three-room school
house, heated by an old pot-bellied stove with a
long stovepipe that ran overhead across the room,
which was always falling down and sending a
shower of soot upon the slates and copy books.

She attended fifth grade at B. Y. U. Training
School in Provo where her mother took the children
for the winter while her father did some remodeling
on the home. Returning to Beaver, Myrtle skipped
sixth grade and took seventh and eighth grades in
turn. She was among the seven to be graduated
from the eighth grade of Beaver District school
in 1889.

From the time Myrtle was old enough to
dream of a life of service she had a longing to
teach. It was sometime while attending elementary
school in Beaver that she began to teach in the
Sunday School. From then on she taught Sunday
School some place or another every single year
for some thirty years and then off and on for
another fifteen, making a total of some forty-five
years she served as a teacher in the Sunday Schools
of the Church.

Following her graduation from eighth grade
she stayed out of school a year to help in the home.
She acted as tithing clerk in her Ward that year.
The fall of 1900 she entered the Murdock Academy,
which had taken over the place once known as Fort
Cameron near Beaver and was in its third year.
She completed three years of high school work
there the spring of 1903, which was all the Academy
offered at that time. She then attended summer
school at B. Y. U. and in the fall began her 
long-dreamed-of public teaching career in the little
town of Frisco in southern Utah, where she taught
the first four grades that winter of 1903/04. From
here on she became self-supporting and also was
able to assist other members of her family in
getting their educations.

The summer and winter of 1904/05 she
attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City
to complete her work for a Normal certificate.
Here she walked off with the honor of being among
the three highest in scholarship for the four quarters.
<span id="page-571"></span>
The next winter she taught fifth and sixth grades
in the Farmington District school and then went to
summer school at the Utah State Agricultural
College in Logan.

The fall of 1906 Myrtle went to Manti to
teach and taught there three successive winters,
teaching fifth grade, first grade and seventh grade
in turn. It was here she first met the lawyer A. H.
Christensen, who was a member of the Board of
Trustees of the Manti High School and closely associated 
with her brother-in-law, Edgar T. Reid.
But she thought nothing of it at the time. She
spent the three alternate summers in summer
school, the first at the A. C. and the next two
at the U. of U. She then returned to her home
town of Beaver where she taught the fourth grade
that winter.

For quite a while a desire had been growing
within her to learn more about sewing. It was
impossible to buy well-fitting, properly styled
dresses in most towns in Utah. Women had to
depend on their own untrained abilities or on the
services of expensive, busy and mostly poorly-trained 
dressmakers. Myrtle believed if women
could be taught to make their own clothes skillfully
that this would add a great deal to their lives. So
she stayed at home in Beaver the following year,
taking a correspondence course from the "Brown's
School of Sewing" of Salt Lake City during the
summer and fall and doing a great deal of professional 
sewing during the winter.

But again, she may have stayed home that 
winter mainly because of a very serious matrimonial 
decision she was required to make. Sewing
gave her more time to think than teaching. She
finally decided against marrying at that time because 
of a difference in religious ideals. This
was only one of several such decisions she had to
make over the next few years however, for besides
being so well trained she was excellent company,
very popular, and a beautiful woman, all in all.
She was much sought after, even by a certain polygamist 
whose proposal of marriage she turned down
with much distaste, She allowed herself to become
engaged twice - but broke those engagements. It
<span id="page-572"></span>
seemed that marriage was not for her at that time.

The summer of 1911 she again went to summer school 
at the A. C. in Logan for the first
session, then attended the "Kiester Sewing School"
there the latter part of the summer. Then she
returned to teaching, this time at the Cove School
in the very small community of Sevier, some miles
south of Richfield, Utah. Here she spent the next
three winters, teaching the first four elementary
grades the first winter and acting as Principal the
next two. Some of her choicest memories stem
from that period, as she felt she was performing
a very worthy mission there aside from her school
responsibilities.

Unlike the preceding teachers in the small
community of Sevier, who commuted back and
forth much of the time, Myrtle took up her residence
there where they had never sent out a missionary,
never had an eighth grade graduate, never had an
M. I. A. organization, and where the people, old
and young, were literally starved for the finer
things of life and truly neglected. Under her
direction the small schoolhouse became a hub of
activity during those three winters. The Sunday
School was reactivated and an M. I. A. organized,
On M. I. A. nights young and old came from farm
houses near and far with lanterns and lamps to
light the small school house, pleading to stay "just
a little longer" as they listened to the reading of a
fine novel, some bits of poetry, or joined in singing
and religious worship. They were given new vision,
not only religious but educational and cultural as
well. "Miss Farnsworth" became not only the
teacher, religious advisor, cultural stimulator,
but also the counselor, nurse, and even the midwife
on a few occasions. There were fewer school "drop-outs" 
and several students went on to graduate from
eighth grade and she was able to assist them in
getting registered later at the Murdock Academy
at Beaver to begin their higher educations.

Myrtle's three winters at Sevier were interspersed 
with two terms of summer school at the
U. of U.; for as she stimulated others to reach
higher she increased her own resolve to do so. At
the close of her last winter's teaching at Sevier,
<span id="page-573"></span>
in order to have her credentials more complete,
she herself went back to the Murdock Academy,
which by then had become a four year high school,
and in six weeks passed off her fourth year of high
school training and received her high school
diploma. 

Then Myrtle left immediately for Chicago,
Illinois, where she spent the rest of that summer
at the University of Chicago specializing in food
preparation, sewing, art, and the social treatment
of crime. She visited art galleries, exhibits,
museums, concerts and the beauty spots of nature,
where she drank in the culture of that beautiful |
city - such a contrast to the poverty of the little |
old town of Sevier. This proved to be a glorious
summer for her.

She returned to Manti to teach Domestic 
Science, Domestic Art and English in the High 
School for a year. Then she went back to Beaver
and taught the same subjects, plus Physiology, in
the Murdock Academy for the next two years. She
was persuaded to return to the Manti High School,
where this time she commanded the highest salary
of any teacher in that district. This was the fall
of 1917. She taught there for the next three winters
and then resigned her position to become the wife
of the widower, Judge A. H. Christensen. Their
marriage took place in the St. George Temple,
23 June 1920. 

Albert was most fortunate to get such a
woman as a second mother for his five children - and
well he must have known it, for Myrtle brought
not only expert training and unusual skill to the
management of his household but great dedication
and unselfish love as well. The children fondly
called her "Aunt Myrtle" from the beginning and 
she accepted this with understanding and grace.
She had a wonderful influence for good on the lives
of these children over the ensuing years, as she
of course did over the lives of her own three
children who came to bless the home.

Phillip tells something of this influence; -- "Then 
came the day when I was about eight and a
half years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the family.
<span id="page-574"></span>
I guess I was kind of a sickly looking little fellow
then because she certainly took me in hand. I was
finicky about what I ate and especially hated eggs.
But there were things I 'adored' and those were
Aunt Myrtle's creampuffs with that good filling
inside and chocolate on top. She put me under
orders, however, that until I ate my eggs and other
food I couldn't have any creampuffs and she certainly 
did enforce those rules, much to my good.
Though I had never eaten eggs if I could get out of
it, she fixed them for me special by breaking them
into a glass then putting the glass into a pan of
boiling water until the eggs cooked up and were
really delicious.

"Through the years this dear woman saw to
it that I was given good, nourishing food and I give
her credit for pulling me out of the doldrums. Now,
as I look back, I can see how silly I was in the things
I liked to eat, but the training from Aunt Myrtle
must have borne good fruits because my wonderful
wife, Gwen, says I will now eat anything and refers
to me in an endearing way as her 'disposal'.

"I recall the day when I was about to leave
our home in Orem for Salt Lake City where I was
to take a bus to Washington, D. C. to join the
F.B.I. and really go out into the great big world
on my very own. I had my things packed, had
taken a picture of Mt. Timpanogos, and was lying
on the couch asleep, or nearly so. I recall Aunt
Myrtle coming and bending over me, apparently
asleep there on the couch, and in her sweet way
kissing me and saying fervently 'God bless you'.
I say God bless you Aunt Myrtle for all you have
done for me over these many years!"

As the family grew in number Myrtle had a
way of drawing the shy new son-in-law into the
inner family circle by giving him a chair to repair
or a light switch to mend. She had the new
daughter-in-law accompany her on shopping trips
and consulted her on the selection of new outfits.
She won the new grandchild over by letting her
help roll and cut out cookies, by swinging her on
the old bed springs swing south of the house, or
by taking her onto her own comfortable lap and
rocking her in the big rocking chair - all the time
<span id="page-575"></span>
singing lullabies in her deep, rich contralto, until
she had put both herself and the little one to sleep.

Myrtle did much community service both
before and after her marriage. Her war work
during World War I and her humane efforts nursing
the sick during the great flu epidemic which both
accompanied and followed it, were worthy of note
as was her service during World War II making
parachutes and doing other war sewing. She was
a member of the "Hopeless Club" in Manti for
years and was an active participant in the Utah
Sorosis Club of Provo for fifteen years while
living in Orem, where her literary knowledge was
used to benefit many. She worked long hard hours
helping to get the Scera Center in Orem started.
She did a lot in Four H Club work for young girls.
She was active in P.T. A. work in various communities 
and served as president of the Orem
organization for some time.

Aside from her service to her large and
active family, however, her service to the Church
was perhaps the most rewarding. This she never
neglected. Besides teaching in the Sunday Schools
some forty-five years or more, she taught numbers
of years in the M.I.A. and served as president of
the Young Ladies in Beaver Ward and then counselor 
in the Stake organization. She also served
as Ward President of the Y.L.M.I.A. one year
in Orem. She was president of the ward Primary
there for seven years. She served on the Stake
Board of the Relief Society while living in Orem
and was class leader in all departments of the
society on a Ward level at one time or another
during the years. She spent part of the last two 
winters preceding her husband's death working
for the dead in the St. George Temple. In fact,
it was only a week or so after the two returned
from laboring there that Albert passed away
(13 Mar. 1957).

With Albert's passing, a wonderful companionship 
of nearly thirty-seven years was ended, as
far as this earthly life was concerned. Though
those years were tempered by both joy and sorrow,
yet on the whole they had held far more of joy than
of sorrow. Albert left Myrtle comfortably situated
<span id="page-576"></span>
and her health was good. She had had comparatively
few sick days in her lifetime and was still able to
take good care of herself. Nevertheless, she
decided to sell her home in Orem and go and live
with one or the other of her daughters, Norma and
Kathryn, in places such as Washington, D, C.,
Bloomington, Indiana, Palo Alto, California, and
in Salt Lake City, whither time took them. She
knew she could still be of service to them and
their young families and she desired this. Now,
at age past eighty-three, she resides with Norma
(Webster) and her Bishop husband and family in Salt
Lake City, where she is still pretty much able to
take care of herself at this writing. Only Norma
and Kathryn can tell of the magnanimity of her
services to them and theirs over the past twelve
years.

Myrtle still has that sweet modesty that
evidences faith in the ability of others and a willingness 
to allow them full credit, and more. In her
exceptional memory she cannot tear herself apart
from those with whom she has mingled - her life's
story seems to be mirrored in the lives and
accomplishments of others. Her appreciation for
the actions and kindnesses of others is never
failing. "Thank you for a wonderful day", a brief
statement given in low vibrant tones from the heart,
is so typical of this most gracious lady, the last
remaining member of her generation of Christensens.

Perhaps nothing can better show the closeness
of this family's alliance or the deep respect of each
member of it for "Aunt Myrtle" than the words of a
letter written to her by Sherman just a month before
the death of father, in recognition of her nomination
as a candidate for the honor of Mother of the Year
for the State of Utah. (She was awarded the place
of "first alternate" to the woman chosen not long
after father's death.)

12 February 1957
"Dear Aunt Myrtle:

"I have just learned that you have been nominated 
for consideration as "Mother of the Year."
Feelings such as those I feel now ordinarily remain
locked in the heart until occasions like this make

<span id="page-576a"></span>

<span id="page-577"></span>
an opening for their expression. Of course, after
a fashion, we communicate them from day to day,
but in such a subtle way that only the ones directly
involved know fully what is meant. These things
we have both understood, I am sure. The kiss of
greeting, a touch of the hand, the wordless comfort
of seeing each other, the 'Merry Christmases',
'Happy New Years' and 'Happy Birthdays' and 'Be
My Valentines' of the whirling cycles, and the
homey visits which now renew the memory of our
day-by-day companionship and love over the years.

"But now, I find that others have been more
articulate in first applying to you the honored title
of 'Mother of the Year'. I wholeheartedly concur,
and hasten to add this expression of my congratulations, 
admiration and love. Yet I cannot think of
you in terms of but a single year, for you have
been to us, indeed, 'Mother of the Years'.

"My mind turns back to that day almost forty
years ago, when the loss of my own mother was
still vivid and cruel and I rode with you by train
to Manti from Salt Lake City where I had been
staying with Aunt Retta during the preceding school
year. Sometime later you and Dad were married,
I have seen you make three different houses into
homes since then, keep up with the finer things of
life in art, music and literature, and inspire all
of us to do so, keep aware of the problems of
neighbors and the world and help to solve both,
and raise not only another woman's children but
your own also, all together as a family unit,
graciously, efficiently and lovingly, without division 
and without distinction. And though we and
ours are now scattered across the country and
beyond, our thoughts are turned constantly to
home, which remains simply where you and Dad
are.

"May God bless you, not only for what you
now are to us -- The Mother of the Year -- but
for what you have been to all of us over the years
gone by.

Affectionately, Sherman."

## ELSIE KATHRINE CHRISTENSEN (Bartholomew)

Elsie, the first daughter born to Laurs and
Else Christensen and the first of the three children
born to them in Mayfield, first saw the light 8 Mar.
1875. A twin sister arrived shortly after and since
there was some question as to whether either of the
tiny girls would survive they were each blessed and
given names right away. The twin sister was given
the name Mary Karen, by her father Laurs, but she
was usually referred to after that as "Karrie". She
died shortly after she was named and blessed. The
early Gunnison Ward records show that Elsie was
blessed and named that day by W. N. Tofte and
given the same name as her mother had been
christened, Else Cathrine, but her name spelling
was later modernized to Elsie Kathrine.

Elsie was born in a log cabin in North Mayfield 
while her parents were members of the United
Order there. She was past two when they left the
Order and went to live in South Mayfield. She was
just past four when her mother left the family in
Mayfield with her father and a Mrs. Anderson in
charge and went to Salt Lake City to study medicine.
The year after (1880), when Elsie was just past five,
the family moved back to Gunnison where they had
lived before coming to Mayfield, but they spent the
next several summers in Christenburg where her
father leased a farm.

Her parents built a new rock house on property
they purchased in northwest Gunnison and here Elsie
lived most of the rest of her life until she was 
married. It was from here that she went to the Sanpitch
River to be baptized a member of the L.D.S.
Church, 2 July 1884, by Jens Jensen. It was here
that she went to the church nearby the day after,
3 July 1884, and was confirmed by Jens Larsen,
and it was from here that she went to receive a
patriarchal blessing from Christian August Madsen,
former Gunnison Bishop, on 15 Apr. 1901, not long
before her marriage.

Elsie started school in Gunnison the year she
was six and the school was held not far from their

rock house. We are fortunate to be able to copy
much of the remainder of her history from her own
record, which she placed in her "Book of Remembrance". 
We quote from this:-- "One thing I
remember when I started school in Gunnison,
Augusta Swalberg, my teacher, made me stand up
by her table for talking. I cried so loud she couldn't
go on with her teaching so she told me to go to my
seat. In my first two years.of school I had learned
my readers so that I could recite them through by
memory. The next three years spelling, reading
and arithmetic were taught. Ward Stevens was the
teacher. The time I liked best was during recess
when Emma Metcalf and I played baseball with the
big boys, one of us on each side. We were good
batters and fast on the run. On Fourth of July I
took part in a running contest; as first prize I
received a beautiful blue feather fan.

"At the age of fourteen I went to the Snow
Academy in Ephraim, Sanpete, Utah, which had
been founded the year before (5 Nov. 1888). The
upstairs of the old Co-op Store there was the 
residence of the institution. Alma Greenwood was then
its president and he was assisted by a Miss Henry.
The Academy was just a preparatory and intermediate 
school.

"The fall of the next year (1890) I kept house
for my father while mother and a foster child, Ada,
went to Denmark to visit her folks. After they
returned home I attended the Seminary held in
Gunnison Ward and taught by Brother Joseph Jensen.
This I started in January 1891. That fall I
went to Provo with my brothers Joseph and Albert
and Vio Sorenson to attend the Brigham Young
Academy. Vio's grandmother, Sister Capson,
kept house for us. The school was held in the
Z.C.M.I. warehouse near the depot, which was
the best that could be had at the time. But on
Monday, 4 Jan. 1892, teachers and students
marched to the new building for the B.Y.A.
between 5th and 6th North on Academy Ave. The
veteran educator, Karl G. Maeser, was released
as president of the school and Benjamin Cluff
installed as his successor. I continued school in 
winters at B.Y.A. until 21 May 1896, when I was
<span id="page-580"></span>
graduated from that institution and received the
degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy. My diploma was
signed by Nelson Duesenberry, President of the
School Board, and Benjamin Cluff, President of
the Academy.

"My first year of teaching school was at
Hinckley, Millard Co., Utah. The next two years
I taught at Centerfield, next to Gunnison. In the
winter of 1899/1900 I returned to B.Y.A. again,
at Provo, to further my education in literature,
taught by Alice Louise Reynolds; music, piano
and harmony under A. C. Lund; and religion
taught by George Reynolds, with special lectures
on the Bible and Book of Mormon given by Dr.
Whitney of Salt Lake City. While attending B.Y.A.
at this time I taught a class in Sunday School in the
Ward in which I lived and Emma Lucy Gates, who
later became famous as a singer, was in my class.
Miss Susan Talmage and I were counselors to
Mrs. Snow in M.I.A. that same year.

"The fall of 1900 I returned to teach school
in Centerfield again until May 1901. Then on 26
June 1901 I was married to Alma C. Bartholomew
of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah in the Manti Temple by
Temple President John D. T. McAllister. That
evening my parents gave us a very elaborate wedding
reception in their home in Gunnison. There were
one hundred invited guests, including four Bishops,
and a big supper was served to all, as was the
custom.

"The next day we went to Fayette and lived
with my husband's folks for nearly a year. Our
first son, Alma Owen, was born in an upstairs
bedroom of their home, 1 May 1902, both grandmothers 
being in attendance, my mother Else as
midwife and Alma's mother Eliza to care for our
needs. We moved from there to a Mellor house,
where our second son, Edgar, was born 20 Aug.
1903. Then we bought and remodeled the Brown
house in Fayette and here our next two sons were
born, Byard 2 Mar. 1905 and Clifton 24 Nov. 1906.

"In June 1907, when Clifton was just past six
months old, we bought a beautiful new red brick
home in Gunnison from Lafe Bown - and here we

<span id="page-580a"></span>
![Red brick house](./images/57.png)

<span id="page-581"></span>
settled." Sorrow caught up with Elsie's and Alma's
family when on 18 Dec. 1909 their beautiful little
son, Byard, passed away. He lacked less than
three months of being five years old. Byard had
never had a strong heart and though everything
they could do had been done for him, he did not
survive. Elsie and her mother were alone with
the child when death came for him; Alma was on
the desert with the sheep. (A more detailed
account of Byard's death is given earlier in the
book.)

Two daughters were born to Elsie and Alma
in the new red brick home in Gunnison; Edith 10
Feb. 1910, less than two months after little 
Byard's death, and Ella May 10 May 1912. Elsie
continues with her history:-- "I have always had
great faith in prayer and the Lord has helped me
so many times when I have been sick or in trouble.
One such incident stands out in my mind. After
Ellamae (or Ella May) was born there were many
months when I felt poorly. When she was three
years old I went to Dr. Olsten in Manti, a specialist
in women's diseases. I was told that I had a
cancerous condition. I had to visit him three times
a week for three months, going from Gunnison to
Manti and back for these treatments. (This was
the early part of the winter of 1915/16). On these
days each week, after I had sent my boys off to
school, I started with my two little girls in a 
one-horse open buggy for Manti. We had mittens,
hoods, hot irons at our feet and a lap robe to
cover us. One day it began snowing soon after we
started so we were well covered with the wet snow
when we reached my parents' home in Manti.
Father was there to take care of the horse. Mother
took the girls and had a hot lunch prepared for us.
Then I went for my treatment. When I came into
the doctor's office he took me by the shoulders
and said, 'Woman, woman; you have the faith to
remove mountains! If Mrs. Andersen had half the
faith you have, she could get well too.' (Mrs.
Andersen was a cousin of mine and was being
treated by Dr. Olsten for the same trouble as 
I - she did not get well). I answered, 'I must get
well, I have little ones that need me!' (That was
over forty years ago and here I am 81, I have been
<span id="page-582"></span>
made well many times by faith, prayer and 
works - 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow. . .')"

Troubles sometimes come in pairs or more
and this was a very difficult winter for Elsie. Besides 
her worrisome illness, she and her husband
had had a serious misunderstanding. Elsie was a
very proud woman and this must have been very
difficult for her to bear. Alma continued to stay
away with the sheep and Elsie struggled with her
problems alone. But she was not of pure blooded
Danish extraction for nothing - her determination
(some call it stubbornness) knew no bounds. Besides, 
as she has stated, she had much faith in prayer. 
She continues with her own history:-- "We sold our 
lovely home to my brother Arthur
Christensen and took his old home, which had once
belonged to brother Chris, in on the deal. Here
the children and I moved the latter part of 
1915 - Alma was with the sheep.

"On 27 Mar. 1916 the children and I and my
brother Lou's family left Gunnison by train headed
for Lyman, Wyoming. The night before we all
stayed at my sister Emma's, since she only lived
about a mile from the depot. We took up a homestead 
about six miles east of Lyman, Wyoming,
rather close to a ranch owned by my brother Chris.
Lou also took up homestead land there and my
brother Andrew and Chris' daughter Pearl, and
later my sister Elvena, making about 2,320 acres
in all which we called 'The Oasis'. The children
and I worked hard clearing the sagebrush, doing
some planting of crops and garden and making the
necessary improvements to prove up on our homestead 
property for two difficult summers. In
winters we rented a place in Lyman, Wyoming and
moved into town so the children could go to school."
A story is told about Elsie when she was living in
Lyman. She was herding her cows as they grazed
on the ditch bank not far from her home there,
taking particular pains to avoid the mud puddles
left by a recent storm. Some people drove up to
her place in a buggy - she wasn't expecting company.
She strained her eyes in their direction and
suddenly she recognized that it was her brother
Arthur and his wife Millie. In her joy she plowed
<span id="page-583"></span>
right through the mud puddles in her haste to greet
them, which she did with hugs and kisses but with
wet, muddy shoes and skirt.

At the end of two years of struggle in Wyoming,
during which time "firebugs" had threatened to drive
them from their homestead, crops had been burned
belonging to her brother Chris, her brother Lou's
house had been set on fire, and Chris himself had
finally lost his life there. Elsie had met the terms
of the homestead act and the place was hers. Many
a time during that period she had stood with a gun
at nights guarding her log house on "The Oasis",
and her young sons had stood guard beside her.

Sometime in the interim, or at least by the
end of those two desperate years, Elsie and Alma
effected a reconciliation. Elsie and the children
joined Alma in Ogden, Utah, the spring of 1918 and
the family were reunited. They lived in Ogden until
the following spring, the children attending school
there that winter, and then returned together to 
Lyman, Wyoming for another year, at the request
of the children. Elsie continues her story: "In
the spring of 1920 we moved to Goshen, Utah and
rented the Robert Boswell farm there. In the four-roomed 
adobe farm house on this place our third
daughter and last child, LaPreal, was born,
8 Feb. 1921.

"Alma and our oldest son, A. Owen, obtained
employment at the Tintic Standard Mine carpenter
shop in Dividend, Alma first and A. Owen later,
and so we moved into the town of Goshen, renting
the John Morgan home for a short time and then
moving into a larger house there owned by Hazel
Done. I became active in the Goshen Ward, enjoying 
the work very much. For some time I was in
the presidency of the Relief Society. I was called
to sing in duets and choruses on many occasions,
was a class leader in the Relief Society most of
my time there and taught the adult class in Sunday
School. I loved the people there and in turn had
many friends.

"In the spring of 1931 we moved to Payson,
Utah, where we had just finished building a new
brick house at 369 North 3rd East. (This lovely
<span id="page-584"></span>
home Elsie lived in the rest of her days in Payson.)
We had not gotten settled when Mrs. Bona, Relief
Society President in our new Payson Ward, called
at our home and asked me to be the Literary class
teacher for that organization. I held that position
for two years and then was asked to be the Theology
class leader, which position I accepted and filled
for eight or ten years. My health then became
poor (she suffered from a heart ailment), and I
was released from all responsibility at that time.
When I became stronger I taught the Literary
lessons for another year. On 4 June 1952 I was
set apart as a visiting teacher in the Relief Society
by Brother Harold Rasmusson of Payson.

"I joined the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers
(D.U.P.) in 1934, Payson Camp 1. I was elected
chorister of this organization 19 May 1940, Regis-
trar 19 May 1945 and chosen Parliamentarian in
1948. I was sent as a delegate to the County con-
vention and was elected second vice captain and
class leader, which position I held until March
1956. I have also been a Sunday School teacher
in the Old Testament department during these
Payson years."

Elsie's husband, Alma, was set apart as
Bishop of their Payson Fourth Ward 13 Jan. 1952,
and served a full two years before being forced to
be released because of poor health. Though he was
three and a half years younger than Elsie, yet he
was more frail and had suffered from ulcers for
many years. He passed away in a Payson hospital
following surgery, 6 Mar. 1954. After his death
Elsie continued to live on in their comfortable
home in Payson. Her unmarried son, Edgar, was
there with her when he could be and helped support
her in all ways - in fact he was wonderful to her!
Her oldest son, A. Owen, and family lived right
next door and kept an eye on her also, until it
became necessary for her to have someone with
her much of the time. Finally she went to live with
Edith, her oldest daughter, in her home in Provo.
Edith, a Ph D in the department of advanced education 
at Brigham Young University, was of necessity
away from home a great deal but she had a girl with
her mother when she herself could not be there.
<span id="page-585"></span>
She was a loving, thoughtful and attentive daughter
and Elsie seemed happy in her home. She gave
her the very best of care.

Elsie loved to travel and her children often
included her on trips they took. She recorded an
account of some of these travels in her 
history:-- "I have visited numbers of places with 
members of my family: Mirror Lake with Edith, Heber and
Co., Yellowstone Park with Ellamae and H. D.
Krantz (before they were married), Grand Canyon
with Edith and her husband, little Helen and Mr. &
Mrs. Mark Sabin and daughters - such a happy,
congenial group, and the canyon was so beautiful
and stupendous I was led to exclaim, 'Lo, what
hath God wrought?' Yellowstone Park was also
wonderful in its own way, a scenic diadem in the
midst of a beautiful, natural mountain landscape
with its water fountains, geysers, myriad cascades
and waterfalls. All were breathtaking, but the
sizzling eruptions of steam and hot water from
the geysers were frightening.

"I had a pleasant trip to California one June,
again with the Bauers and Heber's brother and
mother. We stopped at Lake Tahoe, which had
the bluest water I had ever seen; crossed the
Sierra Nevadas to Sacramento and ferried from
Oakland to San Francisco. The fog here was thick
and cold and we had a hard time finding an apartment 
that night - everything was cold and wet.
But the sun was bright next morning and we saw
Twin Peaks, the Zoo, Seal Rock, Pasadena, fish
wharves, yacht docks, and in the evening visited
China Town. We left for Yosemite Park, where
the deer were tame as young calves and trees
ages old. We visited Palo Alto and Stanford University 
grounds; saw Herbert Hoover's home and
surroundings; had lunch at Mercede; saw 'fire fall'
and the feeding of the bears at Old Village; went to
Mirror Lake, Happy Isle, Alcapetan, around the 
loop to the south entrance and saw the giant Redwoods.
From here we missed a road sign and had
a hot, dusty ride over a cow trail for about fifty
miles. We ate lunch at Fresno and spent the night
at San Fernando. We went through orange groves.
and bought seven dozen oranges for 20&cent;; went to
<span id="page-586"></span>
San Diego and got an apartment and then went over
into Mexico (Tijuana and Caliente); then went back
to San Diego and through the Exposition there,
where we did a bit of shopping. Leaving San Diego
we went to Wilmington, then tock a boat to Catalina
Island and rode in a glass-bottom boat. We visited
the Casino, St. Kathrine Hotel, and strolled along
the boardwalk, disgusted with the scant attire of
men and women. Going back to Wilmington by boat,
we started for home. It had been a wonderful and
new experience. Heber, Edith, mother Bauer,
Heber's cousin Dean Carl Bauer, LaPreal and
myself all took the trip in Heber's car and all
returned home safely and well."

In April of 1957 Elsie took another trip with
her daughter Ellamae and husband (H. D. Krantz)
to pick up a grandson, William C. Krantz (Bill)
who had just been released after serving a mission
for the LDS church. Ellamae writes of 
this:-- "Mother went with us when we went to Mexico to
pick Bill up. The western part of Mexico is rather
isolated from the eastern part, being separated by
the Sierra Madre mountains. Bill was to be officially 
released in Monterey and as we had only ten
days we decided to drive the shortest road to
Monterey - from Mazatlan to Durango. It took
from 9 a.m. until midnight and was only 150 miles.
It was a narrow dirt road, actually only used by
trucks for transporting goods. We switched back
and forth to the top of a mountain and then there
were more mountains as far as the eye could see."
Elsie was just past eighty-two when she took this
strenuous trip but she enjoyed it. Her last long
trip by automobile was when she went with Edith
to spend the Christmas holidays in Texas with
Edith's daughter Helen and family, when she was
eighty-seven.

In her later years Elsie became interested
in genealogy. She took courses in the study of this
subject for which she received certificates, She
organized and put together a very fine "Book of
Remembrance" in which she included a history of
herself and Alma, as well as one of each of their
seven children. She also wrote histories of both
her father and mother and of her Danish grandfather,
<span id="page-587"></span>
Christen Christensen. Genealogy was a subject
the church had begun stressing more and more
during her later years, and being always anxious
to follow the counsels of the church to the best of
her ability, she worked at genealogy during the
rest of her fruitful years. No one could doubt the
love and devotion that Elsie had for the Gospel and
the church throughout all the days of her life.

I was fortunate enough to be invited by Edith
to Aunt Elsie's eighty-eighth birthday dinner. She
had been ill but was feeling much better. A. Owen
and Pate were there and Edith's daughter Helen
and her young daughter Helen, as well as Edith
and myself. When I first came into Edith's home,
I stooped to kiss Aunt Elsie and said to her, "Do
you know who I am?" "Why of course", she said,
"Virginia, I shall always know you. We look so 
much alike, don't you think?"

Finally it became necessary for Elsie to
have more care than Edith was free to give her,
so she was placed for a short time in the Eldred
Hospital in south Provo, where her children could
visit her often. Edith went by plane to Hawaii to
meet her son Boyd, who was enroute from a two
and a half year mission in Taiwan China. The two
had gotten as far as LaPreal's home in California
when word reached them of Elsie's death, 28 June
1964. The death was very sudden and unexpected.
Edgar had visited their mother the night before at
Eldreds and found her in good spirits and in
seemingly good health.

Elsie was eighty-nine years three months and
twenty-one days old when she passed away, the last
of all the Christensens to depart, except two 
sisters-in-law - Andrew's wife Sarah, who lived to be
eighty-nine years seven months and fifteen days
and died 23 April 1966 just less than two years
after, and Albert's second wife Myrtle, who is
still living at this writing.

A fine funeral was held in Payson on July 1,
1964. Burial was in the Payson Cemetery and
Elsie was placed there beside Alma. Her six
surviving children were in attendance. Among
others, cousins Pearl and LaFaun and I met with
<span id="page-588"></span>
the family after all last rites had been spoken. The
Payson home, so long a part of Elsie's life, was
the scene of the meeting, for it had been kept by
the family until this parting. Everywhere I looked
I imagined I could see her, as I had seen her there
so many times before engaged in her labors of love.
I'm sure her spirit was there then, still watching
and praying over her children, as she had always
done as long as she was able.

Alma "C" Bartholomew, husband of Elsie,
was born 10 Oct. 1878 at Fayette, Sanpete, Utah,
the fifth of eleven children born to John Bartholomew
and Eliza Roxie Metcalf. Alma was blessed and
named by John Mellor, 10 Nov. 1878; baptized by
his father, Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Nov. 1887;
confirmed the same day by John Mellor; ordained a
Deacon by his father 18 Jan. 1892; ordained a
Teacher in the priesthood by John James, 23 Jan.
1898; ordained a Priest by Joseph Bartholomew
10 Feb. 1901; and ordained an Elder by his father,
23 June 1901; all of the above taking place in
Fayette. The main part of this history of Alma,
which follows, was written by Elsie in her Book
of Remembrance.

"Alma was reared in a Bishop's home and
taught the gospel by example as well as precept.
His father, Bishop John Bartholomew, was very
devout and consistant in living his religion - it was
'Come, let us go to our meetings and worship the
Lord as all our Father's children should do'. Alma
was regular in his attendance at Primary, Sunday
School and Sacrament meetings. He was especially
grateful to his grandmother Polly Benson (Bartholomew),
daughter of Benjamin Benson of early Church
history days, who enjoyed so much gathering her
grandchildren around her and telling faith-promoting
stories about the Prophet Joseph Smith and the
trials of the Saints of those early days. She related
how she often sat on the Prophet's knee as a little
girl and told of the love he had for little children.
Alma was so impressed that there came to be no
doubt in his mind but that Joseph Smith was a true
prophet of God. At an early period in his life he
<span id="page-589"></span>
developed an implicit faith in the power of prayer
and felt that he knew his Heavenly Father would
answer the prayers of those who asked in faith.
He said, 'In my childish way I prayed about little
things that would have seemed foolish to some but
were a joy to me because I felt that I was being
heard and my little prayers answered.'

"His father was a farmer and a stockman and
did some carpenter work, especially in the winter.
As a young man he had had an accident and had his
right knee thrown out of place, which proved to be
a handicap to him the rest of his life. Alma, being
the oldest boy at home much of the time, had most
of the responsibility and care of the stock, such as
driving them to the range and gathering them in the
fall. He learned to know each by name." Alma
tells of some incidents which stood out in his
memory:-- "In the month of August when I was
thirteen, another milch cow was needed so it was 
decided that I should go to the summer range and
get 'Old Spotty' as they were sure she had freshened
by that time. The day I was to go, mother was up
before daylight to prepare my breakfast and lunch,
as it would be a long hard day for me. I was up as
soon as I heard mother in the kitchen. Father got
Prince, my favorite pony, saddled and a feed of
oats for his lunch securely tied to the saddle.
Father gave me my instructions and mother kissed
me goodbye and her last words were, 'God bless
and protect you dear.' I was soon merrily on my
way and in about two hours was in the canyon where
the cattle were. As father had directed, I went to
all the water holes - but without success. I stopped
at one of the springs long enough to eat lunch and 
rest my pony and feed him his oats. About four
o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I could guess,
I had been to every place I thought the cow could
be. So I decided I had better start for home if I
expected to be there by dark. I traveled two or
three miles towards home with a sad feeling,
knowing how unhappy mother would be that I had
failed. I had a feeling that my Heavenly Father
could help me if I would ask him. So I stopped my
horse and tied him to a tree and went a little
distance down under a pine tree, and prayed for
help. As I finished my humble prayer an impression
<span id="page-590"></span>
came to me that if I would go back to Maple Spring
I would find Old Spotty there. I had been there
earlier in the day and failed to find her, but I
mounted my pony again anyway and rode back
hurridly about two miles towards Maple Springs.
Before I got to the Spring I saw Old Spotty and it
seemed she was waiting for me. I started her on
the way home and she walked as fast as she could,
but it was dark long before we got out of the canyon.
Mother came to meet me when she heard me coming
and she was so happy for my safe return and accomplishment. 
When I told her my story she was happier
still, for the goodness of the Lord to me.

"In September that same year my younger
brother and I went with father into the canyon to
get some logs for lumber. It was a long day and
almost dark when we got to our destination. But
father was well acquainted with the canyon and had
a camping place in mind. Wood was plentiful and
my brother and I soon had a large pile gathered and
we soon got a campfire going, hobbled the horses
out and cut some pine boughs to sleep on. After
prayers we were soon in bed and fast asleep. About
midnight the wind began to blow very hard and
father said later that in the midst of his slumbers
it was as if some invisible force had raised him up
by one arm and told him to move quickly. He
grabbed us boys and hustled us some distance then
hurridly rolled up our bedding and moved that and
the grub box and other camping equipment. It
seemed but a moment after everything was out of
danger that a huge dry log came crashing down
across the pine boughs where we had all been in
peaceful slumber. It would have been death for us
had we not moved. Father often related this 
circumstance to show the power of prayer. He never
neglected his prayers no matter where he happened
to be. We got the logs out and to the mill, had
them sawed into lumber and were home by the end
of the week, grateful for the preservation of our
lives.

"When I was ordained a Deacon I soon became
quorum president," wrote Alma. "This gave me an
opportunity to become better acquainted with its
members. I endeavored to do my duty whatever
<span id="page-591"></span>
the call was. I had many faith promoting experiences 
in the Aaronic Priesthood. I was ordained
an Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood and not
long afterwards, 26 June 1901, I received my
endowments in the Manti Temple and was married
to Elsie Kathrine Christensen by John D. T.
McAllister who was then president of that temple.

"We settled in Fayette for several years
where our first four sons were born. Father and
I farmed together. I sold out my interests there
and purchased a new home from Lafe Bown in
Gunnison in the spring of 1907. At this time I
became interested in the sheep business. This
work took me away from home much of the time
and I became careless in my church duties. I
felt I did not have time to work in the church.
Through this carelessness I became indifferent.
Before long reverses came."

Alma's subsequent separation from his
family has been mentioned in Elsie's history.
Alma was working for the Lindsey Land and Livestock 
Company in southern Utah during this time.
He gave up the sheep business to rejoin his family
in the spring of 1918. They settled in Goshen the
spring of 1920 and Alma farmed there for a couple
of years and then worked for Allen's Market. It
was almost like starting from the beginning.
Finally he got a job working for the Tintic Standard
Mining Co. as "timber shopman". The family continued 
to live in Goshen until 1931 when they bought
a new home in Payson and moved there, having
rented for those eleven years in Goshen.

Alma eventually got back to working in the
church and moved from one position of trust and
responsibility to another. A chronology of his
church positions after moving to Goshen follows: 
Nov. 1920, called to labor as a local missionary
for six months in the Tintic Stake of Zion; 30 Nov.
1931 called as 2nd Asst. to Sunday School Superintendent 
James Mitchell of the Payson Fourth Ward;
1932-1936 served on Scout committee of the Ward
and called to act as its chairman in Nov. 1934;
19 Apr. 1936 set apart as Superintendent of the
Payson Fourth Ward Sunday School; 24 Jan. 1937
set apart as first counselor to Bishop George A.
<span id="page-592"></span>
Francom by Apostle John A. Widtsoe, and also
became a High Priest in the Nebo Stake with supervisory 
duties over the Stake Sunday School, YMMIA
and Aaronic Priesthood; 13 Apr. 1939 called to
serve as Stake Sunday School Superintendent;
28 May 1939 set apart as a member of the Nebo
Stake High Council by Richard R. Lyman; 14 Jan.
1945 set apart as first counselor to Bishop Broadbent 
of Payson Fourth Ward by Elder Mark E.
Peterson and released 5 Dec. 1948; 8 Dec. 1951
called to be Bishop of Payson Fourth Ward and set
apart as such 13 Jan, 1952 by Elder Harold B. Lee.

After retiring from working for the mines,
Alma engaged in carpenter work and building
around Payson. He also raised chickens to some
extent. He died 6 Mar. 1954 in the Payson City
Hospital following a major operation. He was
seventy-five years four months and twenty-four
days old at the time. He was buried 9 Mar. 1954
in the Payson City Cemetery, following a beautiful
and well attended memorial service in the Payson
Fourth Ward chapel.

## EMMA ELIZA CHRISTENSEN (PETERSON)

Emma was born Sun. 18 July 1877 in the new home in South Mayfield recently acquired by her parents, Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen, following their leaving of the United Order experiment on Mayfield's north side. She was the seventh child and second daughter of the couple, although the sixth producing branch of their family tree. When she was nearing two years of age her mother went to Salt Lake City for six weeks to study medicine, leaving her in charge of her father and a Sister Anderson who came into the home to assist with the household and the six children.

Just about the time Emma turned three the family moved back to Gunnison where they had lived before Emma was born. This time they settled in a little adobe home in east Gunnison belonging to Emma's Uncle, Lars Myrup, but they spent the next several summers living in<span id="page-593"></span> 
Christenburg, a small farming community midway between Mayfield and Gunnison, where the father leased a farm from Julius Christensen (no relation). In the meantime her father bought a place of his own in northwest Gunnison on which stood an old two-roomed adobe house, and here the family took up their residence in winters for a while - the family now numbering seven living children and the parents. In time a new rock house was built on their property very near to the old house and both houses were used by the family for a time. The old two-roomed adobe is long since gone but the rock house is still standing (1969) on the corner of Second West and First North in Gunnison. 

Emma was blessed 4 Oct, 1877 in Mayfield by Bishop Ole C. Olsen. She was baptized 2 June 1886 in the San Pitch River some distance from their new rock house in Gunnison, by Peter Peterson and confirmed the next day, Sun. 3 June 1886 in the church near their home, by C. L. Hansen. Emma and all of her older brothers and sisters were re-baptized 1 Apr. 1893, when many of the Saints in Gunnison rededicated their lives and purposes to the Lord. 

Emma attended the Gunnison District school which was held not far from her home until she graduated from eighth grade. No High School was then available to her, so she found work in the O. B. Berglund store in Gunnison and worked there for some time. Emma was thirteen when her mother went back to Denmark to see her people in 1890 and she took a big part in helping to keep
the home running smoothly the three months her mother was away. In fact, she had been given responsibilities in the home very early since her mother was a medical doctor-nurse in the area and much in demand outside the home.

Emma's parents encouraged her to continue her schooling however, so the winter of 1894/95 she attended the Brigham Young Academy in Provo, where her older sister Elsie and most of her older brothers advanced their educations.

She attended B. Y. A. until she could qualify as a school teacher and then taught in Spring City,<span id="page-594"></span>
Gunnison, and then in Axtell for two winters (1899-1901). Cousin Lillian J, Peterson remembers that Emma lived at their home in Axtell during those two winters and that the last winter, when she herself was five, Emma took her to school with her. She writes: - 'Cousin Emma was my first school teacher and I can remember very well that we walked a mile to school. The first words I wrote she hugged and kissed me right in the school room; it seems like it was just yesterday."

After that Emma taught in Fayette, some six miles north of Gunnison, and likely taught there two years also. It seems that it was during that time that she began to be seriously courted by a young Swede named Charles Peter Peterson of Gunnison. Emma was a very pretty girl with dark hair and dark blue eyes, being the only real dark haired child in the Christensen family. She had rosy cheeks and a natural high coloring to her fair skin. She was rather tall in stature and possessed a sweet, loving, gentle disposition very much like that of her father; yet she was very "outgoing" like her mother and so eager to help and please.

Charles was tall, dark, slender and handsome. He also had a very gentle and understanding nature, although he was quite a tease. He and Emma made a very nice looking couple. Tresia remembers that "Charlie" courted Emma in a fine one-horse rig and brought her boxes of chocolates which she stashed away in her bureau drawer where Tresia and Vena, like little mice, got into them. But Charles had one big drawback which loomed high in Emma's mind. He was not a member of the church and some of his people were even real bitter towards it. But real love conquers all. In time Charles qualified to join the LDS Church and on Wed. 30 Sept. 1903 he took her in his fancy rig to the Manti Temple and they were wed. He was eleven months and two days younger than Emma, being then twenty-five, while she was twenty-six. But for nearly one month every late spring they were of the same age.

Following a wedding party held the night of their wedding, at her parents' home, Charles took Emma to live in the home he had on his Bar CC

<span id="page-595"></span>
ranch, just east of Gunnison. Their son Byron and his wife Mildred have collaborated on a short history of Emma's life and from it we now quote:--"This was the beginning of a busy and eventful life for Emma, rearing her family and supporting the activities of an ambitious farmer and stockraiser. Emma had three children, Byron, Ada and Imelda, whom she reared to maturity but she lost two little girls who were stillborn between Ada and Imelda. Ada remembers how beautiful the one little sister was as she lay in her box-coffin - like a big doll asleep. Charles buried each of the little stillborn babies on their ranch just across the wash from their house.

"While the menfolks and hired hands were busily engaged in the fields and on the range, Emma milked many cows and made and sold pounds of delicious butter. She hauled barrels of good water for drinking and carried hundreds of bucketsful from the creek for washing and other purposes. She raised chickens, turkeys, pigs and geese. Byron says, 'I often remember in my childhood seeing geese, who had waddled way up onto the hill above the house, sailing past the kitchen window as they made a flying landing in the back dooryard.'

"There is always the fond memory of Grandpa and Grandma Christensen coming to our house. How Grandmother enjoyed having Mother Emma brush and comb her hair. It was such a beautiful head of waist-length auburn hair and she wore it in braids that were fashioned into a bob on top her head. Sometimes Grandmother would ask if we had a 'runty pig', referring of course to a baby pig who wasn't doing so well. Father always seemed to have a 'runty pig' when grandmother desired one. She seemed to have a special talent and pride in getting these little pigs all plumped up and doing fine in scarcely no time at all.

"Aunt Elvena was a very kind and helpful sister in Emma's home during her child rearing years, helping to both care for and 'spoil' Emma's children, or so Emma said. In later years, after Vena was married, Emma was able to return the favors - somewhat. Vena's second child, Alta,<span id="page-596"></span>
was born at the Peterson home and when the third child, Tresia, was born in the farm house on the Albert Christensen farm west of Gunnison where Vena and George were living, Emma took care of little Alta at her home.

"Often, during her leisure hours, Emma would hitch the horse to the buggy and, taking the children along, go to visit Vena at the Gunnison ranch, or Arthur and Millie, Louis and Florence, Chris and Caroline, or Elsie and Alma, in Gunnison and even Grandpa and Grandma in Manti.

"In 1918 Charles and Emma bought their first car which was known as the 'Big 4 Overland'. One day enroute to Manti to visit Grandfather and Grandmother Christensen, Charles managed to get the car up to the speed of twenty miles per hour. Emma
became quite alarmed and was sure he was driving 'too fast'.

"Emma cooked for many hired hands over the years, due to the customs of the day and the various periods of harvesting of the crops, threshing, etc. Some of this help even came from foreign countries and the isles of the sea. Each of these workers became somewhat attached to the family and enjoyed the friendly hospitality of the Peterson home.

"Emma's home was truly a gathering place for relatives and friends also. Whenever company came there was feasting, music and singing, games of all sorts and lots of good old fashioned fun. One night Emma bedded down thirty-eight relatives in her home. There is no guarantee just how many slept but each had a place to lay his or her head. Byron says, 'I can remember five cousins sleeping in one bed, three along the top and two across the bottom. It is just such times as these that are the most pleasant of all to remember and keep in our chest of precious memories. I recall Mother insisting on the cousins performing when they came to the home. We would always have a program when our talented cousins came. Aunt Millie's twins could play the piano and sing; Uncle Andrew's Edythe, Aunt Elsie's Edith and Ellamae, Uncle Albert's Virginia and Elaine, and Uncle Lou's LaFaun, Rose, Alice and Marjorie could all make<span id="page-597"></span>
the air ring with sweet music. Mother loved music and could play and sing a bit herself.'

"Emma was born with that rare gift of being a peacemaker. There wasn't much room for family squabbles and misunderstandings as far as she was concerned. Also, she had a very affectionate and emotional nature. Her eyes would often overflow with tears of pure joy and appreciation and yet she would react the same way in her moments of sadness. She and Charles were true examples of pure love and devotion to each other and to their children. These same choice virtues she displayed equally with regard to her beloved father and mother, as well as to her brothers and sisters and all others who availed themselves of her generosity. She was so charitable and sensitive to the needs of others. And she had a way with people - truly she was an influence for good among her fellowmen.

"Once Uncle Ben Peterson, Charles' brother, came to live in their home for a few months. He had acquired the cigarette habit, which of course was very distasteful to Emma and Charles and their family. With tact and being able to say just the right things at the right time, however, Emma was influential in giving him the courage and determination to 'shake' the dirty habit. He was most grateful and many were the times in the years which followed that he sincerely thanked her for this kindness to him.

"Uncle Joseph liked to drop by often on his way to and from his farm and partake of the proffered refreshments. And mischievous Uncle Lou, who delighted in teasing, would come in and help himself to any sweetmeats or delicacies that were available, whether Emma was at home or not. At her return from the garden or field he would pretend to be extra hungry and when she would go to serve him a piece of pie or what-not, she would find to her amazement that her 'cupboard was bare', so to speak, since Lou had already devoured the 'treat' ahead of time. Her brother Louis would have his little joke!

"Passers-by and even hoboes dropped in many times at her gate requesting 'hand outs'.<span id="page-598"></span>
Some said hers was a 'marked place'. She asked a hobo who called one day if this was so and how her place was 'marked'. 'This', he said, 'I cannot reveal - but it is true'.

"Emma was not only kind to people and even strangers but she was kind to animals. She became very attached to the cows, pigs and horses on their ranch. At one time her brother Albert was in need of a good milch cow for the foreman of his Gunnison ranch and asked Charles to sell him one. Charles consented. When the foreman came to take 'old Bossy' away, Emma was in tears. And she wept for quite a while afterwards, as if she really loved that old cow. She was very tender hearted when it came to their animals. The animals on the farm seemed to reciprocate.

"Emma was active in all of the auxiliaries of the church at one time or another, being most prominent in the MIA. In the YLMIA organization she served as a counselor in the Ward and later as president. She was a Relief Society teacher and then served as first counselor to the ward Relief Society president, Mrs. Hyrum Fredrickson, and later as second counselor to President Lena Madsen in the same organization. Before such occasions as Thanksgivings, Christmases, after bazaars, etc., it became her duty and privilege to take her horse and buggy and help deliver the gifts of food and kind remembrances to the worthy families of her particular ward. Many have testified that she was indeed a virtuous and noble woman. This was indeed a great heritage to leave to her children and grandchildren.

"Mainly she lived a life of joy and happiness and her labors were labors of love. She made it a point to go with her family for at least two visits to Wyoming while Aunt Elsie, Uncle Lou, Aunt Vena and families and some of Uncle Chris' family lived
on the ranch at 'The Oasis'. Later, when Elsie and Vena and families moved to Goshen, Emma made numerous visits to them there. She spoke in most endearing terms of her brothers and sisters and loved ones - it was always 'dear sister Elsie or Vena; dear brother Chris, Andrew, Joseph, Albert, Louis or Arthur; dear father, dear mother,<span id="page-599"></span>
or dear cousin this or that. One had only to know her to love her."

Byron says, "One of mother's happiest Christmases was when she awoke on Christmas morning to find nothing in her stocking except a can each of corn, peas and beans. Her disappointment was more than she could bear and she burst into tears. Dad quietly slipped out of the room and up the stairs and with some assistance carried down and presented to her Santa's real gifts - the most beautiful carpet and set of dishes she had ever owned. Tears mingled with cries of joy and laughter brought a very dramatic climax to her Christmas that year."

"Emma was normally slender but she developed a diabetic condition and became rather heavy in middle age. She was a striking woman, however, with her dark heavy hair, rosy cheeks and high coloring. She had a rather low-pitched speaking voice which seemed to caress as it spoke. She had a gentle, humble, sweet way about her and was very tolerant and patient, and in this she was much like her father, but she was much like her mother in her love for humanity and the living things of the earth. She was most devoted to family, friends, the less fortunate and the church - and to her Heavenly Father.

"In 1926 she took into her home the two motherless children of Lindon H. Johnson, Dale and Ramona. She promised to care for them for a period of two weeks, but became so attached to them she asked to be allowed to keep them a whole year. At a later date these two children became her grandchildren by adoption when her oldest daughter Ada became the second wife of Mr. Johnson. But Emma did not live to see or know this - nor did she live to see any of her very own grandchildren."

Imelda, Emma's youngest child, writes of her: "Mother must have been a wonderful teacher. I remember so many of her early students, when they were older, telling of what an outstanding teacher she had been to them. She was also a great Relief Society worker. After the horse-and-<span id="page-600"></span> 
buggy days, when we children were older, we often took her to her meetings in the car and waited to drive her home. She never did learn to drive the car. I can also remember how often we had Sunday guests and Conference visitors. My, the crowds were always with us. Wish I knew how to handle guests with the grace and efficiency mother did. Those were great years! Now we seem to have so many more conveniences but our lives aren't as abundant. Mother had few of the things we think of as necessities and take for granted now, but her life was rich and abundant in the joy of service, love and friendship - in the real values of life."

Byron and Mildred continue: "On her fiftieth birthday, 8 July 1927, electricity was turned on in Emma's home for the first time. Before that they had used candles, kerosene or oil lamps for lighting. Emma was only privileged to enjoy this luxury for the short period of about two months. During her later years the city water was piped to her kitchen from town, a mile away, and she had running water in the house for the first time.

"In August of 1927 their daughter Ada and Mr. Lindon Johnson, who were then keeping company, suggested that Emma and Charles share a ten-day vacation trip with them to the colorful canyons of southern Utah. They had a wonderful trip together. But on their return, Emma didn't feel so well and she grew rapidly worse. In spite of all the special nursing and loving care that was showered upon her, it became evident that she could not survive this last diabetic illness. She passed away at her home on the ranch east of Gunnison, 4 Sept, 1927." It was autumn, her favorite season of the year. She was buried 7 Sept. 1927 in the Gunnison cemetery following a well attended, beautiful funeral service worthy of such a lovely lady.

Ada, gentle and sympathetic in nature like Emma, was at her mother's bedside almost constantly during this serious and final illness. She pled with her not to leave them. Ada has operated rest homes for elderly ladies for many years now, and in speaking of this she says she never helps an old lady to her rest at nights without thinking of her<span id="page-601"></span>
own darling mother, during her last days; then her heart swells with love for all the "mothers of others" in her care and makes her work a labor of joy and dedication to the memory of her own precious mother whom she loved so dearly.

Charles Peter Peterson, husband of Emma Eliza Christensen, was born in Brunflo, Sweden, 10 June 1878, a son of Marten Gronvell Peterson and Barbru (Barbara) Pahlson Peterson.

Charles left Sweden for the United States 2 Aug. 1879, when he was about fourteen months old, in company with his parents, Marten and Barbara Peterson, two half brothers, John and Peter (sons of his father by a former marriage), a sister Marta and a brother Paules; Charles of course being the youngest. They settled in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah among other Scandinavians,
some of whom they may have known. They were not members ofthe L.D.S, Church but came to Zion to better their living conditions.

Charles' father was a shoemaker by trade and the 1880 census taken in Gunnison the summer of that year bears this out. It lists the family as follows: "Marten Peterson, age 45, male, married, occupation shoemaker, born in Sweden; Barbara Peterson, age 33, female, married, keeping house, born in Sweden; Peter, age 18, male, single, son of Marten, works on farm, born in Sweden; John, age 16, male, single, son of Marten, apprentice (likely to his father) born in Sweden; Marta age 6, female, single, daughter of Marten, born in Sweden; Paulus age 4, male, single, son of Marten, born in Sweden; Charies Peter age 2, male, single, son of Marten, born in Sweden."

Five other sons were born to this Peterson family after they moved to Gunnison. They were a thrifty, energetic group. The oldest son, Peter, became a shoemaker, like his father; two of the other boys became farmers, and the rest were businessmen of some sort. John at one time was Mayor of Gunnison.<span id="page-602"></span>
Charles attended the public schools of Gunnison and graduated from the eighth grade, He had decided te attend B. Y. A. in Provo, when he was offered a job he felt he could not afford to turn down. Imelda writes of this: "A Mr. Bown offered Daddy a high salary if he would take over some of his herds of sheep; in fact, the price was above average and too attractive for those days and he went on the job. We often felt like scolding Mr. Bown when we were older, for our Daddy would have been a real mathematics major - or so we thought. He was always measuring hay and could tell measurements of size, weight and acreage, etc., so easily, although his book learning was so little."

Charles must have done all right with Mr. Bown's sheep, for before he was twenty-five years old he had a large farm with a nice two-story house on it, some stock and equipment and a fine driving horse and rig of his own, all paid for. He was prepared to take a wife and ready and able to support a family. But he was having a little difficulty in this respect, for the girl he had chosen had made some rather stringent demands of him, before she would become his bride.

It seems that none of Charles' people were members of the L.D.S, Church - nor was he. The girl he had his eyes on, Emma Christensen, refused to marry him unless he could take her to the L.D.S. Temple for the ceremony. This must have seemed difficult for a young man of his age, but he set about to try to qualify himself to become a member of the church in which she was affiliated. He succeeded, however, and was baptized into the L.D.S, Church 30 May 1903, just eleven days prior to his twenty-fifth birthday.

Charles courted Emma in his one seated rig drawn by his fine horse, and it was in this outfit that he took her to the beautiful Manti Temple, 30 Sept. 1903, to be married, thus fulfilling their dream of several years. He took her home to live on his ranch about one mile east of Gunnison and it was here she lived the remainder of her days, and here that each of their three children, one son and two daughters, were born. It was here also that two little stillborn daughters came to them and<span id="page-603"></span>
Charles made little box coffins for each and buried each in turn himself across the wash from the house on their own place.

The ranch itself supported the family very nicely with the cows, chickens, ducks and other barnyard animals they raised there. Charles fed lots of stock, including as many as fifty pigs at a time. Byron tells that when he used to get angry at his father he would go down to the pigpen and threw rocks at the pigs to make them squeal. Nevertheless, the son Byron learned to be a big help to Charles on the ranch, and as he grew to manhood worked side by side with his father.

Charles was very good to Emma's parents - he couldn't do too much for them. He often gave Laurs employment on his ranch and paid him well. Else liked to help thin beets and harvest potatoes for him, and when she did he paid her too. Often he gave them a "runty pig", a lamb, a cow or a few laying hens. They were always more than welcome at his home and he at theirs, for he was more like a son to them than a son-in-law.

Following the death of his beloved wife Emma, 4 Sept. 1927, Charles and his three children got along by themselves until Ada was married and moved away. Then on 31 Dec. 1929 Charles married a Danish widow, Minda Peterson of Redmond, who had several children of her own. She stayed on in Redmond and Charles lived there with her but continued to help Byron operate the ranch and spent lots of time with him and Imelda.

The middle of March 1930 Charles sent Byron on a mission to South Africa and had Emma's niece, Vera Clark, come to be company for Imelda. Vera writes;-- "I had been staying at Uncle Charles' with Imelda that summer of 1930, so I stayed right on that winter and took my 7th grade work in Gunnison. I have fond memories of that year. Byron was on his mission and Ada lived in Delta. We visited Ada and family several times during the year. Uncle Charles was so good to me!"

After several years Charles' wife, Minda, was stricken with brain cancer and rushed to a Salt Lake hospital for treatment. Charles took<span id="page-604"></span>
his turn with her children watching by her bed of suffering but she soon died and he returned to live at his ranch home.

He was a fine gentleman and very good to everyone, especially Emma's sister Vena and her large family. How often I remember Charles and Byron driving up in his large truck to a Christensen family reunion, with a number of George's and Vena's children aboard. They would come from Gunnison around by way of Goshen or Santaquin to bring them. Charles was so pleasant and jovial and always took part in the games and other activities at these reunions with seeming relish. He was usually among the first to arrive and the last to leave, bringing a spirit of good will and brotherhood along with him. I remember him as slender, tall, dark, good looking and oh so friendly. He did not push himself forward but was always there to do his part and more. He had excellent health, was a hard worker, honest and clean living, and had a ruddy glow about him that one could not help but admire.

From the time of his baptism Charles was consistant and faithful in his efforts in behalf of the church, in spite of the fact that some of his own people were downright bitter towards that organization and made things uncomfortable, if not difficult for him. Among other responsibilities, he served as Counselor in the M.I.A., an officer in the Seventies Quorum, and a member of the Hamilton Ward bishopric in Gunnison for many years. Soon after Byron returned from his mission, having no more sons to send, he sent his daughter Imelda on a Canadian mission, June 1934. He held the office of High Priest in his later years. No one could question his love for the gospel and the church. Cousin Florence C. Hougaard remembers speaking to him in the Manti Temple on one occasion, at which time Charles remarked to her that his life since he had become active in the church was like "Heaven on earth."

When Byron married in 1936 and brought his wife Mildred home to the ranch house to live, Charles stayed on as a most welcome part of the family. Though he had his own room upstairs and

Twenty-five years in a wheelchair yet Byron can still smile and tell a good family joke.

<span id="page-605"></span>
could come and go at will, he chose to enter into the family's activities. As the grandchildren came along they learned to adore him. Byron's oldest, Barta, tells of how thrilled she was to dance with her grandfather at a Relief Society bazaar one time when she was about seven. Charles loved to dance and was conisidered to be an excellent dancer.

On 14 May 1945 Charles married Mrs. Lydia Adair and moved out of the ranch house for the first time since he had brought his bride Emma there to live some forty-one and a half years before. He and Byron continued to operate the ranch together and have most of their other activities together as well. About four months later, however, Byron was stricken with polio and rushed to the General Hospital in Salt Lake City for treatment. He would never walk again!

Charles looked after Mildred and her five little ones, including a two months old baby, and kept in close touch with Byron in the hospital as well. On 8 Oct. 1945, three weeks after Byron was stricken, Mildred had invited Charles and Lydia to come to the ranch for supper. But Charles never got there. Right after a good lunch that noon, one of his calves got loose and he took off after it. Without warning he was stricken with a heart attack. He died with his boots on enroute to the hospital.

Of all the times when it seemed that Charles was needed most on earth, this was the time. But he was called to serve elsewhere and others were left to solve the earthly problems. His two daughters, Ada and Imelda, came to help with burial arrangements. It was six days after his death before this took place, 14 Oct. 1945. He was laid away beside his beloved wife Emma in the Gunnison Cemetery. A copy of the remarks given at his funeral service was made and sent to Byron in the Salt Lake hospital.

## LOUIS "D" CHRISTENSEN
<span id="page-606"></span>

Louis, or "Lou", eighth child, fifth son and
seventh producing branch of the Laurs and Else K.
Christensen family, was born 20 Mar. 1880 in Mayfield, 
Sanpete, Utah. He was christened Lars Peter
Christensen 1 June 1880 by Bishop Ole C. Olsen of
Mayfield. Soon the name Lars was changed to Louis
and in early manhood the middle name Peter was
discarded in favor of the initial "D". For a time
Louis also changed the ending of his surname from
sen to son, as some of his older brothers had done,
but he eventually went back to the original Danish
spelling of Christensen, which all of his descendants
now use.

When Louis was but a few months old his father
sold the home in South Mayfield and moved his family
into east Gunnison where they lived for a time in a
small adobe house owned by his brother-in-law, Lars
Myrup. Then his father purchased a large lot in
northwest Gunnison, on which stood a small adobe
house of two rooms, and into this the family of nine
moved and lived in winters so that the older children
could attend school. In summers for the next four
or five years, however, the family lived mostly on
a farm in north Christenburg, midway between
Mayfield and Gunnison, which their father had leased
from a well-to-do land and stock owner by the name
of Julius H. Christensen (no relation). It was here
on this farm, with lots of room to roam, that young
Louis spent many of his early days. It was while
living here on the farm in Christenburg, when he
was just under five years old, that he suffered the
severe injury to the four fingers of his right hand,
which were so badly burned to the knuckles that
they could not be saved. It was only through the
faith and prayers of members of his family and the
never-ending work and care of his doctor-nurse
mother, Else K., that the hand proper was preserved. 
Even then this seemed like a miracle.
More details have been given about this accident
earlier in the book. Though knobs finally grew on
the stumps of his maimed hand, where the fingers
had been, and though Louis later learned to use this
<span id="page-607"></span>
crippled right hand with great dexterity, it is
understandable that this must have been a source
of embarrassment and concern to the youngster
when he was ready to enter school.

A new rock house was soon erected near the
old adobe one on the family lot in northwest Gunnison 
and into this the family had settled themselves
by the time Louis was ready for school. He finished
the eighth grade in the public schools of Gunnison
but it is doubtful that he continued his formal education 
beyond that. At one time he jokingly told his
children that his folks managed to get him up to
Provo, hoping to enroll him at B.Y.A., but that
he climbed through an upstairs window of their
living quarters into a tree and got away -- Louis
was a great joker! Yet it was true he got no
college education.

He was baptized in the Sanpitch River, some
distance from their home in Gunnison, 1 Aug. 1888,
by Bishop A. C. Madsen and confirmed next day in
church, 2 Aug. 1888, by Thomas Wasden. He was
ordained a Deacon 7 May 1893, according to the
early Gunnison Ward records. Louis loved music
and he had a rich, deep voice. He and his younger
brother Arthur used to sing in the ward choir,
according to their foster sister, Tresia.

Louis grew to be the tallest and largest of 
the Christensen family, which was made up of good
sized people, both men and women. A great lot of
Danish soup and dumplings must have gone into his
making. He inherited a beautiful head of blonde,
curly hair. He was husky, strong and vigorous in
his youth and full of fun. He loved to play pranks
in which he often involved his younger brother
Arthur. When Arthur began courting, these jokes
and pranks proved to be most annoying to his sweetheart, 
Millie, who was pretty sure Lou was leading
Arthur "astray". Their youngest sister, Elvena,
was often the victim of these pranks and jokes,
being so utterly without guile and trusting like
she was.

When the Spanish blew up the Maine and the
Spanish-American War was declared in early 1898,
a number of young men from Gunnison volunteered
<span id="page-608"></span>
at the first call for troops in Battery C. U.V.A.,
and Louis was among them. The boys were given
quite a "send off" as they left Gunnison depot by
train in early July. But when Louis reached Salt
Lake City he was told that the complement was
filled and was sent home. This was a great
disappointment to him and he strongly felt that he
was rejected because of his maimed hand, although
he was a much better shot with a gun than most of
his friends and associates. He was always very
sensitive about that crippled hand.

There was plenty of work for all at the Christensen 
place, with chickens, ducks, pigs, cows to
milk, horses and a large vegetable garden and
lucerne patch, not to mention the 140 acre farm
his father bought which had to be cleared of greasewood, 
as well as the other land he operated. But
as soon as Louis was old enough to be trusted out
with the sheep he was given a job by his brother
C. I. and worked several years as one of his 
herders.

Louis was ordained an Elder 3 Feb. 1901 and
it was anticipated that he would be soon called to
serve a mission for the church. However, on
March 6 1901 he took Miss Sarah Florence Mellor
to the Manti Temple where they had their endowments 
and were sealed in marriage for time and
eternity. This was on a Wednesday and just two
weeks before his twenty-first birthday. Florence,
who was from Fayette, was a few months short of
her twenty-second birthday. He was large, with
curly blond hair and blue eyes. She was dainty and
small with dark hair and big brown eyes. Since
Florence's mother had been long dead, Laurs and
Else held a wedding party at their home in Gunnison
the evening of the marriage, at which a fine wedding
supper was served.

Louis and Florence went to live in the old
Mellor home in Fayette where Florence had lived
and cared for her younger sisters and brothers
since her mother had passed away before she was
fourteen. Three months after they were married,
Louis received his expected mission call. He was
to serve in the Western States Mission. He was
set apart for this 11 June 1901, and left soon

<span id="page-608a"></span>

Their four oldest living children: Lafaun,
Lucien, Rex and Dale

<span id="page-609"></span>
afterwards to labor in Colorado. However, due to
the serious illness of his wife, who was expecting
their first child, he was soon called home and
given an honorable release in order to help take
care of her. Florence began to mend and their
little daughter, Florence LaFaun, arrived safely
and well, 12 Dec. 1901 in Fayette.

Within a short time Louis had made arrangements 
to move his family to Gunnison. His brother
Arthur, in a letter to his sweetheart Millie, dated
17 Feb. 1902, stated: "Louis bought John Wasden's
place so I guess he will be my neighbor now." The
John Wasden place was across the road south and
a few doors to the east of Laurs and Else's home
in northwest Gunnison, and here is where Louis
and his family settled for the next few years. This
must have been a wise thing to do since Louis was
working for his brother Chris at the time and gone
so much with the sheep. His parents could look
out for his little family.

Louis worked for several years as a herder
for his brother C. I. and was for a time in charge
of the sheep grazing territory in Twelve Mile Canyon 
and surrounding grazing areas. Then in about
1907 he took over operation of a ranch by the Sevier
River, west of Gunnison, which his brother Albert
had purchased, and moved his family, now enlarged
by the addition of two sons, into the poorly equipped
farm house that place afforded. Rex was the baby
then and rather sickly. Florence had many worries
being so far away from a doctor with him.

In the meantime Arthur had married and had
gone into the sheep business with Albert and Louis
worked for them with the sheep when he was not
tied with the ranch, which he managed for a couple
of years. He and Arthur took care of the herds on
the west desert during the winters.

The first of the year 1909 Louis' parents
decided to move to Manti where they could be near
the temple. They were also planning a trip back
to Old Denmark to see their relatives and search
out more of their genealogy. They suggested that
Louis buy their home in Gunnison. After having
had the sad experience of losing their fourth child,
<span id="page-610"></span>
a baby son Spencer, in May of 1908, Louis and
Florence must have been grateful for the opportunity
to move into the comfortable rock house in which
Louis had grown to manhood, and accepted eagerly.
The old Gunnison Ward records list Laurs and Else
Christensen's membership as having been transferred 
from Gunnison to Manti in early February
1909, so it must have been about that time that
Louis moved his family into the old home. It was
here their next three children were born.

Louis continued to work with Arthur with the
sheep, wintering on the.west desert and in Twelve
Mile Canyon for the summer months. They lambed
their sheep on Cedar Mt., east of Salina. It was
on Cedar Mt. that Louis was taken seriously ill,
Arthur's brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill, tells of
this: "I was with Lou on Cedar Mt. when he had a
stroke. I rode to Gunnison that night for help and
Lou was taken to town. Jake Sorensen from Manti
came down with us. If I remember correctly this
was in July 1910. Louis had become very heavy
and had high blood pressure. He was ill for quite
a while after that."

Arthur and Albert turned their sheep into the
Bennion Livestock Company later that same summer, 
and they were driven up into the Weber River
area in northeastern Utah, where their brother
Chris then had his interests in connection with the
Bennion Livestock Company, of which he was 
co-owner and general manager. Back on his feet
again, Louis was given employment by his brother
Chris with the same company. December 1913
found him with a herd of sheep near Lyman, Wyoming, 
which area was to play so great a part in the
remainder of his life. He took up 640 acres of
homestead land not far from Lyman in January
1915, close to some property owned by his brother
Chris. His sister Elsie Bartholomew homesteaded
some land near his at the same time, as did his
brother Chris' oldest daughter Pearl. Later his
brother Andrew and his sister Elvena also took up
some land in the same vicinity and the entire acreage 
owned by the Christensens came to be known
by them as "The Oasis".

Louis moved his family from Gunnison to
<span id="page-611"></span>
Wyoming in March of 1916. He then had six living
children, the youngest and second daughter, Alice,
being less than two years old. His sister Elsie
took her five children and moved to Wyoming at
the same time. The night before they left Gunnison 
they all stayed at their sister Emma's, who
lived but a mile from the Gunnison depot, from
which they all left by train the next morning, 27
Mar. 1916. Both families lived in two rooms of
the four-roomed cabin that Chris had built on his
place on The Oasis until cabins could be built on
their property. This was the first project to be
attempted that spring and soon Louis and his
family and Elsie and hers were housed in their
own log and frame cabins on the Wyoming ranch.

The story of the next few years in Wyoming
was like something out of a Western movie mystery
and as full of intrigue. Desperados tried to force
the Christensens off their land by stealing their
stock, burning their crops and setting fire to their
homes; during which time the beloved brother Chris
became an innocent victim of this range war and
died 5 Oct. 1917. The story of those nerve-wracking 
years has been told in detail in an earlier
chapter of this history, titled "Wyoming Interlude".
Eventually all of the Christensens sold out their
holdings on The Oasis or let them go for taxes,
except Louis, who chose to remain in the area
and "face the music" as it were. He moved his
family into Lyman where, having been deputized
at the time of all the trouble on his ranch, he
became active in the law enforcement of the region.
He bought out the property of his deceased brother
Chris on The Oasis and his holdings there then
totaled some 882 acres and the four roomed cabin
built by Chris, which his family used from time to
time. He continued to farm on the ranch, in between 
his duties as deputy sheriff; it was a good
place to keep his boys busy.

Life was not easy for Louis or his family
that winter following Chris' death. Rumors about
the burning of the crops and the killing and other
outrages on the ranch were flying thick and fast.
Some people were friendly to the Christensens and
some were unfriendly and even suspicious. The
<span id="page-612"></span>
private detective who had been hired to investigate
the trouble and came out for six months, with his
traps, clamps, guns, saddles and other gear,
masquerading as a trapper, was busy at his work
and sometimes stirring up more trouble for the
Christensens than help, it seemed. Known as
Operative #209 this Mr. Davis set up and serviced
his traps and then appeared to loiter in saloons,
stores, sheep camps, ranches, town dances or
any place he could secretly take the pulse of public
or private opinion. He operated mainly in the
areas of the mostly Mormon community of Lyman
and the somewhat anti-Mormon one of Mountain
View, some miles apart in Uinta County in the
Bridger Basin of Wyoming. He sent in his reports
to his superiors weekly, and abstracts from a few
of these give an indication of the opinions he was
able to glean: (For obvious reasons only initials
are used here for most names. )

"Jan. 1, 1918 - Opr. finds that there is a
great deal of talk right now about the Christensen
burnings. It seems that everybody has the same
opinion and one and all connect the name "H" with
the burnings. There was an article in the Bridger
Valley Enterprize recently giving a list of people
who had contributed towards a fund for Mr. Christensen
that he might rebuild his home again, and
you can be sure none of the "H" gangs names were
there, though the petition was said to have been
presented to them. . . I rode over from Lyman
south to Smith Fork and set up a few traps, then
rode over towards Mountain View where Mr. "H"
lives. I stayed overnight at the ranch of a Mr. "R"
who referred to the Christensen fires and said that
"The Black Hand" had burned Mr. Christensen's
house twice and caused the shooting of Mr. Christensen's 
brother. He seemed to think it was an
outrage and about time the authorities were doing
something about it. I asked him if he had any idea
who would do such a dastardly trick. He said no
one seemed to know positively but that the Christensens 
had taken up a good deal of government
land formerly used by Mr. "H" as a lambing ground
and that a great many people in the county were of
the opinion that "H" is the man who is responsible
for the fires. . . All the interviews I have had with
<span id="page-613"></span>
people here so far, they all seem to think very
well of Mr. Christensen but hold a contrary opinion
of Mr. "H". People say that "H" has a fine wife but
that he is a regular would-be outlaw, that he carries 
a gun with him continually, and that his boy
is as tough as he is. Taking everything into consideration, 
Opr. is firmly of the opinion that Mr.
"H" is the brains of a pretty bad gang here and
everything would indicate that this gang did the
Christensen burnings."

Operative was anxious to get closer to that
"H" gang but made no headway until he hit upon a
certain plan. It had been reported to him that Mr.
"H" had been circulating the rumor that Opr. was
a German spy. The general talk was that it was
very necessary to be on the lookout for spies, for
it would be easy for anyone to go up in the mountains 
and put poison in the creeks which would in
turn poison all the stock and people. Following
his new plan, in a conspiracy with the Uinta
County officials, Opr. #209 had himself arrested
as a suspected spy and was taken into custody by
Deputy Sheriff L. D. Christensen. The Bridger
Valley Enterprize carried the news under the heading 
"Arrested as a German Spy Suspect" and it
read thus: "On complaint of Mayor C. G. Youngberg 
of Lyman District Attorney Matthews authorized the 
arrest of R. L. Davis as a possible German
spy. Davis entered the Bridger Valley a few weeks
ago as a trapper, but his actions and pro-German
statements made Lyman and Mountain View residents
suspect him of being an undesirable character.
Sunday night the County officers went to Davis'
cabin and searched it but aside from finding five
revolvers of the best make and 1500 rounds of
ammunition, no incriminating evidence was found.
He was arrested on Monday morning and taken as
a prisoner to Evanston and turned over to the 
Federal authorities for further investigation, which
may result in his being interned for the duration
of the war at one of the prison camps."

Of course Opr. was soon released and went
right away to Mountain View, telling all he met
there what a "dirty deal" he had been dealt by
Christensen and the people of Lyman. His plan
<span id="page-614"></span>
worked beautifully, for soon most of the "H" gang
warmed up to him and even went so far as to invite
him to pull his traps in the Lyman and Smith Fork
areas and put them around the "H" herds, which
he did. Although Mr. "H" himself was very wary,
his son soon accepted Opr. as a close associate
and soon these two were spending much time
together at the sheep camp where the younger "H"
seemed to be "hiding out". Here Opr., from time
to time, was able to observe at close hand many
little things that led him to believe that the right
gang was suspected. For example, there was the
time that he accidently ran across the "H" son and
his camp tender skating up the canal to opposite
the Christensen place, and when he asked them
why, they laughed and said they were going to trap
muskrats there - "the big kind!" Opr. figured if
he hung around there it would just be a matter of
time until conclusive evidence could be secured
or until some other crimes were attempted.

Then there were the inflamatory statements
that the "H" son made, such as: "If I ever shoot at
Christensen at fifty yards it won't be through his
coat but through his body. . . If Christensen ever
does find out who burned his place, I'm going to
him with two six-shooters and hold one on him 
while I hit him on the head with the other, and if
he moves I will plug-him. . . Besides, Christensen
comes out every few days with a new story, sometimes 
accusing the cattlemen, then me, then somebody else. . . . 
They haven't got proof that I done
the burning and cannot convict me of it. If they
arrest me they had better convict me, for if they
don't Dad will break Christensen". The "H" son
also said from time to time that he believed L. D.
Christensen set the fires himself and he told various 
stories about where he was the nights of the
burnings but none of them jibed. He also said that
his father was waiting until some of the homesteaders
round about got starved out or disgusted with 
home-steading and then he'd buy them out cheap.

In his report at the end of February, Opr.
#209 included these statements: ". . . The people
around Lyman have made sore open remarks to
the effect that if the guilty parties are arrested
<span id="page-615"></span>
they should be lynched; and Opr. is of the opinion
that all of this is not idle talk and for that reason
suggests that proper care be taken in making
arrests. Opr. is also of the,opinion that if the
arrests are made, the younger 'H' will break down
under some rapid questioning."

On Mar. 5th, after some careful arranging,
Mr. "H", his son, his camp tender and Opr. #209
were arrested and taken by train from Carter to
Evanston where they were lodged in the county jail.
The next day Opr. was released and went on with
his work, while the other three were kept until the
10th and then let out on bail. Mr. "H" said at the
time that he didn't think the authorities had anything
definite enough on him to be a serious threat, but
let them try to convict him he had plenty of money
to protect himself with. But he was careful enough
to watch his Ps and Qs for awhile, for he knew his
every move was being watched somehow.

So the Christensen case stood while the
investigation went on into April and May. And
though the general feeling towards the "H" gang
seemed to be getting worse all the time, new 
conflicting rumors appeared that seemed to point in
another direction. For example, it now seemed
that the case might be bigger than ever and the 
work of a Mr. "K" and a Mr. "M" and others of
their associates who, it was whispered, had
planned to get Mr. "H" in bad and in this way
force him to sell out to Mr. "K". Thus, if they
could get Mr. "H" and his crowd out of the country
they would then finish Christensen and his relatives
by fire and force them out also. Then the range
would be open for them all the way to Lyman, and
if Mr. "K" bought out the "H" home ranch it would
make a good pen ground for their cattle and in that
way there would be nothing to prevent them ranging
where they would, with pens on either end for
feeding. It sounded plausible.

A criminal lawyer came out from Salt Lake
City and took testimony after testimony under oath,
with the assistance of Operative #209. But as has
been told in a former chapter, the case never came
to trial, the investigator was dismissed and the
affair finally dropped. Perhaps none were more
<span id="page-616"></span>
relieved to have this episode in their lives die a
natural death at last than the Christensens.

Louis was elected Uinta County Sheriff
beginning with the election of Nov. 1918, for four
two-year terms. He moved his family of ten into
the "sheriff's house" in Evanston, Wyoming. He
failed to serve his fourth term as county sheriff
however, as he was appointed Wyoming State
Commissioner of Law Enforcement by Gov. Nellie
Taylor Ross, first woman governor in the United
States in the early part of 1925. So he moved his
family to Cheyenne, Wyoming, which was the State
Capitol, and had his office suite in the capitol
building there.

The Christensen family lived in Cheyenne for
two years and then returned to live in a nice home
in Evanston, Wyoming and Louis continued to serve
in law enforcement on a city level. He served in
law enforcement in Wyoming at some level or
another for nearly thirty years. He was a valuable
man in that field. Many criminals crossed his path
during those years. His daughter Rose, telling of
this, writes: "'Louis was a big man' his Bishop
said of Dad, 'with a heart to match', and I agree.
Bishop Rawlins also said of father, 'There was no
one more persistent in tracking down and bringing
criminals to justice; yet no one kinder to those he
had captured'; and with this I also agree."

Oil was being found in the area about this time
and Louis decided he would look for oil on his ranch.
A rig was set up and men started to drill on the
place. His son Weldon tells of an incident that
happened during the drilling: "I guess one of the
most exciting things that ever happened to me was
the time the big steam boiler blew up on our ranch
six miles east of Lyman. Some oil people were
drilling for oil on our place. This particular day
some drillers were trying to pull some casing or
pipe out of the hole they were drilling. After
trying and trying, without success, they decided
to dynamite it out by sending a homemade bomb on
the end of a cable a thousand or so feet down into
the hole in hopes of breaking the casing in two and
loosing the pipe. The cable was attached to the end
of the steam boiler. Several tries were made to

<span id="page-617"></span>
pull the pipe up with this method, sending down
the bombs and then trying another pull on the
casing with the rig and steam machine. The bombs
were lit on top of the ground and then some of the
men had to hold the pipe very steady with pipe
wrenches while others screwed the top on the bomb
to make it water-tight. There were eight sticks of
dynamite in each of these bombs, and as each one
would hit the bottom and go off it would send up
water and cable into the air for many feet. During
this dangerous work the drillers were trying to
get more steam out of the old boiler so it could
pull harder, although it already showed 180 lbs.
on the guage.

"Dad and I, who had been watching this
operation, decided to go down to the lower ranch
to get a small load of hay. The drillers were still
trying for more steam when we returned. We tied
our team up near the barn and walked over to the
steam boiler to try and get our hands and feet
warm, as it was mid-winter and terribly cold.
Dad went into the little 'doghouse' first, took off
his overboots and put his feet up to warm them.
He was sitting on a couple of barrels of new oil
that were parked in front of the boiler. He called
to me, 'Come on in - it's nice and warm in here'.
I don't know why, but I had stopped just outside.
the 'doghouse' door and when Dad called to me,
all of a sudden I had a very clear warning or
impression that we were to get out of there fast.
I yelled back to Dad, 'Come back out and let's
go quick!' He looked at me a second and said,
'OK son, let's go then'. He didn't even put his 
shoes back on - just picked them up, came out
and walked quickly with me to the oil rig in his 
stocking feet. As we entered the rig-house the
driller laughed at him and asked him why the 
such-and-such he was running around in his stocking
feet. Dad answered that he believed in 'hunches'
and when he had seen the look on my face as I 
yelled at him to get out of the 'doghouse', he had
a hunch he better do as lasked. Well, just then
my brother Rex and the two other drillers came
into the rig-house from outside the rigs, making
it so that all six of us were then in the rig-house
which was built of planks and heavy tin. It was a
<span id="page-618"></span>
good thing that we were all in there because just
then the steam boiler blew up, completely destroying 
the 'doghouse', partially blowing out the
walls of the offside of the rig-house and shooting
steam and hot water in all directions. The tin
part of the rig-house had protected us from the
steam and hot water and from most of the explosion, 
and later we were able to crawl out of the
break in the rig-house on the lumber side. I have
never forgotten the feeling that came as a warning
to me that day and we all knew at the time that we
had been protected by a heavenly power far beyond
our understanding."

LaFaun writes; "Father spent so much money
drilling unsuccessfully for oil on his 882 acre ranch
that he lost the ranch and also his pretentious home
in Lyman. He and the family were forced to move
to a modest place in another part of Lyman, which
mother tried to make more pleasant by surrounding
it with beautiful shrubs and flowers."

Soon their eight children all married and left
home, or left home and married, as the case
happened to be, and Louis and Florence were left
to live modestly in their little home in Lyman. Of
the eight, only Weldon chose to spend his married
years in Lyman and eventually built a home for his
family next door to his parents. The others came
home quite often and were always welcomed with
open arms, and Louis and Florence went to visit
their out-of-town children on occasions,

Florence passed away in Ruth, Nevada, 24
Nov. 1952. She was brought back to Lyman for
burial. Left alone, Louis lived by himself in
Lyman, with Weldon and his wife next door to sort
of look after him when he was there. But he was
very lonely and restless and his eyes were giving
him trouble, due to a diabetic condition. He was
forced to use a cane when he went places, to be
more sure of his step. He began to travel quite a
bit each month and LaFaun tells of this: "The last
few years of father's life he traveled almost 
continually, first to California to see Rose, then to
Nevada to see Alice and Marjorie, then to Salt
Lake City to see me, and then on to Nampa, Idaho
to see Dale and Ruby, as long as Dale was alive.
<span id="page-619"></span>
Then he would go back to Lyman to pay current
bills, then he'd start the travel routine again. I
used to drive him from Salt Lake home to Lyman
about every other week and clean his house through
for him. I always drove up to Lyman and back on
Saturdays as I had to be back to Salt Lake for Sunday 
church commitments and back to work on
Monday.

"On Saturday, the last of January 1959, I
drove father home to Lyman. When we entered
the house the bathroom floor was partially torn up,
a strange tie was on the buffet and the quilts I
always used to make a bed on the davenport were
gone. Father looked in the closet and said his gun
was gone too. I was upset and worried. Many convicts 
had threatened his life over the years. I
begged him to come back home with me but he
refused, saying he had to pay current utility bills
on Monday. Monday night I phoned him from Salt
Lake to see if he was alright, as I was so worried
for fear someone had been in his house who meant
trouble. But father said he was Ok."

Weldon writes: - "Dad had been one of the
best sheriffs Evanston or Lyman ever had and his
record in Evanston proved it. He destroyed more
stills during those bootlegging days than any other
law enforcement agent. (We have pictures of stills
being destroyed by him.) But you know, there
were people calling him up on the phone during his
last days. His phone would ring and when he'd
answer 'Hello' there would be no answer. I know
this to be a fact as I was at his house and close to
the phone on two separate occasions when calls
came. I have no idea how many calls of this kind
Dad had, but it was evident that someone was trying 
to frighten or confuse him. We wondered if it
was some of the people he had arrested over the
years who had threatened at the time to 'get him'
or 'to get even'. It was a constant worry.

"One night Beth, my wife, and I saw the
shadow of someone walking between Dad's house
and ours. We could see Dad through his lighted
window walking around inside his house and there
was the outline of someone walking between our
house and his lighted window. Beth and I took out
<span id="page-620"></span>
after this shadow - but it got away through the lilac
bushes and over the fence before we could get to it.

"On Feb. 5, 1959, Dad visited with me at my
house, as he often did when he was home in Lyman.
He seemed the same as usual - very relaxed and
calm. He talked to me for a couple of hours then
I guess, while I cleaned my day's gathering of eggs.
He told me at this time that he had dreamed about
mother, his earnestness showing in his face. He
seemed a little embarrassed to tell of something so
close to his heart. He said that in this dream, or
whatever it was, it seemed as though mother was
standing in front of him, her feet not touching the
floor. He said her being there didn't seem like a
dream but a reality and he was so happy to see her
that he began crying a little and then said to her:
'Hello Sweetheart'. She answered, 'Hello Lou - I'm 
going to bring you a present in a little while
dear'. He said, 'Oh darling, all I want is you!'
At this mother smiled a little and then just faded
away. 'I don't know what she meant', said Dad
then, 'but it surely seemed good to see her.' Then
he looked over at me and said he hoped he hadn't
worried or embarrassed me by telling me of this
and I told him I was glad he had. Dad then said,
'It's time you fed your chickens for night isn't it?'
I looked up at the clock - it was 3:30 p.m. 'Yes,
I guess I'd better feed them and then go up and get
Beth from work', I said, and then we both left the
house, he going towards his house and I out to the
coops to feed the chickens. 'Well, I'll see you
later dear' he said and I answered, 'Ok, and I'll
see you'.

"The next morning, Feb, 6, 1959, I had been
to work at the school house (driving bus) and had
also taken Beth there to her work. I usually
gathered my eggs three times a day to cut down
on breakage, so I went out to the coop to gather
eggs. As I walked across the floor to the far end
of the coop I spotted an egg on the floor. I had
stooped over to pick it up when the strangest feeling
of foreboding came over me - like the time the
boiler blew up on the ranch. I don't know how long
I stood there puzzled, knowing something was wrong
somewhere, when suddenly I walked out of the coop
<span id="page-621"></span>
without finishing gathering the eggs, set my bucket
down and went straight over to Dad's house. I
knocked but there was no answer so I stepped inside 
and called to Dad - but there was still no
answer. I went hastily to his bedroom. It was
dark there as the blinds were down as usual. I
turned on the light and froze stiff. There was my
father on his bed - dead. He had been shot and a
gun was in his own hand. Finally I gathered my
stunned senses together and looked the situation
over very carefully without moving from the spot.
I started to cry and then got out of there and went
to find Beth and then ask some people to call the
sheriff at Evanston and also the coroner. They
put it down as a suicide but I myself will never
believe that it was. I can't prove anything but I
just know that it wasn't, without a doubt." After
appropriate and beautiful funeral services, Louis
was buried beside his beloved wife in the Lyman
Cemetery, 9 Feb. 1959.

Their daughter Alice wrote: - "I have had
the grandest father, mother, sisters and brothers
on earth - just a marvelous home life with them."
And their daughter Rose concludes this history by
writing: - "From my sentimental, loving Dad I
think I might have inherited my love for music.
Always I shall remember his rich, deep voice
reflecting his moods - to awaken us in the 
mornings - to entertain us while he sat and chorded 
his own accompaniment - to rock me to sleep until I was
so tall he'd turn sideways to get me through the
door while I pretended to be asleep.

"He had a fine sense of humor and keen perception 
with his love of people. We used to have
wonderful discussions on countless subjects and
were great friends. He had the air of sweet
dignity and old-fashioned courtliness that is seldom
seen today. Wherever I've gone, someone has
remembered him and gone out of their way to help
me because of it. I rented a room in Santa Monica,
Calif. at one time from an old woman who, I found
out later, was from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and
who said Dad had captured the murderer of her
grocer-husband - she couldn't do enough for me
after she found out who I was. This is typical of
<span id="page-622"></span>
what I mean.

"In spite of his size, my Dad never was
ashamed to show and speak of his love for his
family. I have many letters I treasure from him
in which he speaks of his great love and pride in
us all. He was a wonderfully kind and loving 
father, with a heart that couldn't say 'no' to anyone
in need. My girls called him 'Big Grandpa' and
were surprised to find that he also knelt to pray;
I guess they thought only we smaller people needed
the guidance of a higher power."

* * * * *

Sarah Florence Mellor (Christensen), wife of
Louis "D" Christensen, was born 4 July 1879 in
Dover, a very small pioneer Mormon community a
short distance west of Fayette, Sanpete, Utah, but
no longer in existence. She was the daughter of
James Mellor Jr. and Charlotte Elizabeth Dack
(Mellor) early Utah Mormon pioneers of English
extraction. The Mellor family soon moved from
Dover to Fayette and became prominent members
of that Mormon community.

Florence attended the public schools available
at the time in Fayette, and it is doubtful if she 
obtained any more formal schooling. But she became
well taught in the school of life, for before she was
fourteen her mother died and her father, being a
polygamist, went to live with his other wife, leaving
young Florence in charge of four younger brothers
and sisters and with only the minimum of help from
him.

Florence soon learned the arts of running a
pioneer home with all the intricacies of rug making,
soap making, butter making, bread making, candle
making, etc. If she often learned the hard way,
being without the instruction of her precious mother,
yet she learned and became a good cook, a competent 
seamstress and a fine homemaker. She learned
to be frugal and "make ends meet" - there were no
other dependable ways of survival in those early days.

Florence was a beautiful girl, rather small of
stature, with wavy dark brown hair and big brown
<span id="page-623"></span>
eyes. She was gentle, kind and loving by 
nature - sympathetic and understanding. She was quiet and
soft-spoken and she had almost unending patience.
She was very religious, with an abundance of faith,
hope and charity that helped mold her into an outstanding 
wife and mother.

She was courted and won by Louis Christensen, 
a large, curly-headed handsome fellow of
Danish parentage who lived in northwest Gunnison
along the main road that then ran from Gunnison
to Fayette, about six miles distance. The wedding
date was set. Florence and her younger sister
made her wedding dress of white "china silk".
Florence saved this dress and later used the
material to make a "christening robe" for her first
daughter, Florence LaFaun. The marriage of
Florence and Louis took place in the beautiful
Manti Temple, Wed. 6 Mar. 1901. A lovely
wedding reception was held for them by the parents
of Louis, Laurs and Else K. Christensen, in their
home in Gunnison that same evening.

Louis came to make his home in her childhood
home in Fayette, but within three months he was
called to serve a mission for the church in Colorado,
leaving Florence in rather poor health as we have
learned. Her condition worsened and though her
mother-in-law, Else K., who was a doctor and
nurse, did all she could to assist her, it was
thought wise to have Louis called home to be with
her and help in her care, and to be on hand for the
birth of their first child, LaFaun, born 12 Dec.
1901 in the old Mellor home in Fayette.

From Fayette Florence and Louis and child
moved to the Wasden home across the road south
of Laurs and Else's in Gunnison, where two other
children were born to them, both boys, Lucien and
Rex. Else was always on hand to help deliver the
new babies and to care for them and the mother.
Florence must have felt lost without her kind and
efficient mother-in-law nearby when they moved
west a mile or so onto a ranch while Rex was still
a baby.

Louis was away a lot with the sheep and Rex
was sickly and hemorrhaged easily and often.
<span id="page-624"></span>
LaFaun tells that at such times her mother would
almost despair, alone in the poorly equipped farm
house the ranch afforded, with only the three little
ones and no neighbors or help within a mile or more.
She would do all that she knew how to do to help the
child and then gather the two older children to her
and kneel beside the baby's bed and pray earnestly
for help from the Heavenly Father. LaFaun says
she will never forget those prayers for help, and
feels sure that her mother pulled little Rex through
with faith and prayers. She can still hear the lullaby
her mother sang to him as she sat and rocked and
rocked and rocked him in her arms to comfort and
soothe him.

Another little boy was born to Florence and
Louis and they named him Spencer. But they were
not permitted to raise this little one and he passed
away within five weeks, 6 May 1908. They then
moved back to Gunnison into Louis' childhood home,
which his parents vacated in preparation for a trip
back to Denmark. In this comfortable rock house
three more babies were born, two boys and a girl.

Though Louis was gone with the sheep a great
deal, life in the rock house was more pleasant, the
church and school were nearby and the older children 
were getting to be some help. Then Louis took
up homestead land near Lyman, Wyoming and decided
to move the family there. So bag and baggage they
all bid Gunnison farewell and took the train for
Wyoming, 27 Mar. 1916, together with Louis'
sister Elsie C. Bartholomew and her five children.

Life on the frontiers of Wyoming was not an
easy one, especially while living on and developing
the ranch to meet homesteading requirements. The
first two and a half years were especially difficult
ones, since unknown but unscrupulous persons who
coveted the range they were taking up tried to run
them off their property by burning down their ranch
home twice and devious other ways - leaving them
in a state of constant upset.

When Louis was elected county sheriff and
they moved into Evanston, Wyoming and later when
he was appointed State Commissioner of Law
Enforcement and they lived in Cheyenne, things
<span id="page-625"></span>
were a little easier. Two more daughters had
been added to the family however, making eight
living children in all to call Florence mother.
When reverses came, sometime after returning
to Lyman to live and the family were forced to
seek more modest quarters, Florence's flower
garden and shrubs brightened their surroundings
and their lives and even drew the attention of many
flower lovers in the area. LaFaun writes: - "Mother's 
flowers and gardens proved attractive
to many people and particularly to a number from
the extension division of the University of Wyoming,
as flowers, fruits and shrubs that it was supposedly
not possible to grow in Wyoming were grown in her
well kept yard.

"She was always an outstanding mother and
homemaker. Besides raising her four brothers
and sisters she raised eight children of her own
and buried one. Her wise budgeting of expenses
kept the family on an even keel for many, many
years." Though blessed with many talents she
made that of homemaking and motherhood her
greatest goal in life and it was indeed her glory.

Florence was in rather poor health the last
few years of her life. When at last it was too
difficult for her to take care of herself, or for
Louis to either, she went to be with some of her
married daughters, a few months with Rose in
Santa Monica, Calif., and then with Marjorie in
Ruth, Nevada. It was while in Ruth that she passed
away, 24 Nov. 1952.

Gleaned from her funeral card is the 
following: - "In memory of Sarah Florence Christensen,
born July 4th 1879, Dover, Utah; passed away
November 31, 1952, Ruth, Nevada. The time and
place of services - Mon. Nov. 24, 1952, 2 p.m.
Lyman Grade School auditorium. Services conducted 
by Bishop Merrill B. Asay. Final Resting
Place - Lyman Cemetery. Arrangements by 
Gilbert Bills Mortuary."

Her daughter Rose wrote: - "I hope that I
have inherited some of my mother's outstanding
qualities - her spiritual strength and courage; her
love for the Gospel and the church, for her children
<span id="page-626"></span>
and family, for flowers and animals. She was kind
and sweet to everyone. She spent two months with
us before her death and never did she complain
about the crippling, painful arthritis she had and
the discomfort of the edema which was to take her
life. Instead of taking the pain pill the doctor had
given her, each night she would ask me to lift the
venetian blind on the door so she could see the
flowers outside. They were so beautiful to her
that they made her forget her pain. She especially
enjoyed the moonlit nights. She was one of those
'green thumbers' who could grow anything, and her
own yard had always been a showplace for the town.
Her mother had died when she was not much more
than twelve and her life had been a hard one, but
she was never bitter. Her faith and love helped us
all. She was always a real friend to me and we
enjoyed so many hours together as long as she
lived."


## ARTHUR MARINUS CHRISTENSEN

<span id="page-626"></span>

Arthur (twin) ninth child but eighth producing
branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K. Christensen
family, was born about four o'clock a.m. 19 July
1882 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. He was named
and blessed that same day by his paternal grandfather, 
Christen Christensen. His twin sister born
shortly after him that same morning was blessed
and named Martina Lauriette right away but died
about noon the day of her birth.

It is doubtful that the new rock house on the
Christensen lot in northwest Gunnison had been
completed by the time of the twins' birth so they
must have been born in the old two-roomed adobe
house that stood well back on that lot at 180 West
lst North, which dwelling has long since been
demolished. However, the Christensen family,
then numbering ten, must have moved into their
new rock house built west and south and near the
old one, while Arthur was very young, at least to
live in the winter months. This "new rock house",
though now very old, is still standing and owned
and occupied at present (1969) by Ella Knighton Hansen.
<span id="page-627"></span>

Arthur's first several summers were spent
with his parents and brothers and sisters in
Christenburg where his father had leased a farm.
The boy was often left in the charge of his older
brothers and sisters, since his mother was a
doctor and midwife and her services were much
sought after in Gunnison Valley.

When of proper age he entered the public
schools at Gunnison, which convened within a few
blocks of his home. Soon after he turned eight
years old, Sat. 6 Aug. 1890, he was baptized in
the Sanpitch River some distance from his home
by Brother C. J. Swenson. Brother R. G. Fraser
confirmed him next day, Sun. 7 Aug. 1890, in
church.

Arthur's youth was spent attending school in
winters and working at home and on land farmed
by his father in summers. There was plenty for
all to do on their place with chickens, ducks, cows,
horses, lambs and pigs to feed and care for, as
well as a large garden and a lucerne patch. His
parents were not ones who liked to see their |
children idle. Arthur was often found in the
companionship of his brother Louis, some two
years older and much larger. When they were
old enough their oldest brother, Chris "I", gave
the two work with his herds and thus they learned
early of the sheep herding business. This was a
great family to work together and help each other
out.

Arthur was of a gentle, kind and patient
nature, like his father. He had a happy disposition
and was easy to get along with. That his older,
fun-loving brother Louis sometimes took advantage
of this to involve him in "pranks" can well be
imagined. (A few of these have been related
earlier in the book.) That their youngest sister,
Elvena, often became a victim of their mischief
we can be sure. But Arthur grew to manhood a
hard worker, dependable and loving life.

Arthur's parents, but more particularly his
mother, had a great desire that their children
become well educated. Most of his older brothers
and sisters had gone on to school following their
<span id="page-628"></span>
eighth grade education and several had graduated
from the B. Y. A. in Provo. Whatever his reasons,
Louis refused to go on to school and this undoubtedly
had some effect on Arthur. However, his parents
finally persuaded him to get some higher education
and he attended the B. Y. A. the winter of 1901/1902.
He roomed that year at 333 East 5th North in Provo,
which was the David Jones home, no longer standing.
Whether he attended college more than that one
winter we cannot be certain, although it is quite
possible that he may have attended B. Y. A. the
following winter also.

Arthur was "keeping company" at the time
with a girl, Millie Gledhill, a pretty dark-eyed,
dark-haired young lady of many talents who lived
two blocks west of his home in Gunnison. Though
she was not attending school at Provo they corresponded 
regularly. Her brother Bert gives this
account of how the two became interested in each
other: -- "During those days in Gunnison Grandpa
and Grandma Christensen (I always called them
this) kept a boarding house and my older sister
Millie went to work for Grandma, helping with the
housework and cooking. Of course this brought
Arthur Marinus Christensen and Amelia Jane
'Millie' Gledhill together in courtship - and later
marriage."

Millie's sister, Mary Gledhill Dowdle, now
in her eighties, tells of their marriage: - "When
Arthur and Millie were married they went to the
Manti Temple, 3 Feb. 1904. She turned twenty-two 
twenty-three days later. She was five months
older than he, lacking one week. A large wedding
reception was held that night at our home and, as
was the custom, a big dinner was served to all the
guests.

"The two first lived in a small house two
doors east of his parents, Grandpa and Grandma
Christensen as we called them, but when mother
died about a year later (1905) they moved two and
a half blocks west into our home so that Millie
could care for father and us younger Gledhill
children. It was here, 22 June 1905, that their
first child Arthur Melrose was born. He was a
beautiful baby and they nicknamed him 'Rosy'."

<span id="page-628a"></span>

<br><br>
Millie and Arthur as childhood sweethearts

<span id="page-629"></span>

Millie's brother Bert continues with his
story: -- "After leaving the Gledhill home where
Melrose was born, on 367 West lst North in Gunni-
son, which is still standing, Arthur and Millie
moved to a home on Second South and Second West,
which I believe they rented and which has long since
been torn down. Here their next three children
were born, which included another son, Wesley,
and a pair of twin girls, Grace and Gladys.

"After his marriage Arthur was associated
with his brother A. H. Christensen in the sheep
business. They lambed their sheep on Cedar Mt.
east of Salina. After lambing, about July lst, they
would move into Twelve Mile Canyon for the summer
months and then winter on the west desert.
As I remember, Arthur and his brother Lou took
care of the sheep on the desert until the later years.
I also helped Arthur with the sheep at times. The
summer of 1910 we got word to take 1500 head of
sheep and start for the Weber River area above
Oakley, Utah. Arthur met us above Gunnison and
was in charge from there on. That, I believe, was
the start of the Bennion Livestock Company in
which Arthur, A. H. and Chris 'I' Christensen
became interested. Chris 'I' was made general
manager of the company.

"In the summer of 1910 also, Chris 'I' sold
out his interests in Gunnison and moved his family
to Salt Lake City, but spent most of his time on
'The Weber' where the Bennion Livestock Company
owned a large ranch and had their main headquarters. 
Arthur bought Chris' home at this time and
moved his family there to 3rd West 1st South.

This home is standing today. In 1911 the Bennion
Livestock Company bought a small ranch at Upton,
Utah, in Summit County on Huff Creek from a Mr.
Benson and Arthur was appointed foreman of that
ranch. He moved his family to Upton the spring of
1911. I lived with Arthur and Millie and worked
on the ranch for some time. Though not a rendezvous 
for the Bennion Livestock Company's herders,
they came there for supplies which were hauled
twelve miles by team from Coalville."

Millie was then expecting her fifth baby and
as winter came on and the year began to draw to a
<span id="page-630"></span>
close her hour of delivery grew nearer. They
rented a small place in Coalville, where she could
be near a doctor and medical help. She and the
four children moved there for about a month and
Arthur was by her side as much as he could be.
The child, a little girl, came 18 Jan. 1912.
Arthur dropped a card to his father-in-law, Nephi
Gledhill of Gunnison, Utah, that same day, announcing 
her birth: - "Dear Father" it read, "a girl - at
Coalville - 9 lbs. Our girl came a little sooner
than expected - but all seems to be well, Arthur."
They gave her a blessing and a name, Mildred,
right away, but little Mildred died the following
day, 19 Jan, 1912, of prematurity. She was buried
in Coalville.

Both Grace and Gladys have vivid recollections
of those days. Gladys writes: -- "Grace and I used
to play in the storehouse at Upton, which was
sometimes used for the storage of dynamite. One
of our favorite games was playing 'Papa and Mama'.
One day Grace was the papa, whose job it was to
get up in the morning to make the fire. We had
some matches and she set fire to an old rope which
was hanging from the ceiling. About that time
mother called us and we scampered out, not
realizing that in a matter of minutes the whole .
place might be ablaze. Our Uncle Bert Gledhill
spotted the smoke and got everyone out of the house
in a hurry, as they thought there was dynamite in
the storehouse. But there wasn't. Grace and I
didn't tell 'til years later that we had started the
fire, and then no one believed us."

Grace writes: -- "When our family moved to
Upton Gladys seemed to be the constant concern of
everyone there. Besides falling into the ditch and
almost drowning, had not Uncle Bert saved her,
she fell down the elevator shaft at Coalville, to
say nothing of setting the storehouse on fire at our
home in Upton, I was in on this too, and I can
remember being thrown over the fence in an awful
hurry - and words about 'gun powder being stored
there',

"Both Melrose and Wesley started school at
Upton, They rode horses - we all did, the four of
us kids on one horse at times. Melrose was
<span id="page-631"></span>
reliable and was the 'boss' when Dad and Mother
were away. I remember the flash flood and water
running through the house in all directions and the
four of us standing on the table with fire shovels,
trying to shovel it out.

"I remember the wonderful music made by
my father and mother. Their sweet voices blended
so beautifully. Mother played the guitar and dad
the mandolin. At this time I thought there was
nothing so heavenly. Many times we were lulled
to sleep by their songs."

Both Arthur and Millie had good voices and
loved music. Arthur had sung in the Gunnison
ward choir in his younger days, along with his
older brother Louis. Millie had done some public
entertaining, along with her younger sisters, Mary
and Sylvia, when she was a girl at home. Arthur
and Millie were fine companions. Both were young
at heart and both really loved life. They had such
good times together - and how they loved to dance!
Whenever possible they attended the local dances
at Upton regularly.

Dances were held in the Upton amusement
hall on weekends. On special occasions children's
dances were held in the afternoons and then the
adults would take over and dance until dawn, usually
to music on the organ and the violin. This was not
an ordinary amusement hall but a very unique one.
It was built by the small community in 1891 and was
50 feet long 26 feet wide and 13 feet high, with
wainscoating up from the bottom 4 feet. The
unusual thing about it was the upper walls, for on
these a local artist, Frank Clark who had joined
the LDS church in England and come to Zion in
1863, finally settling in Upton, had painted some
outstanding murals. One side was the scene of an
Indian village, the other a landscape scene complete 
with animals. The battleship Maine covered
one end of the hall and a steam engine pulling many
cars covered the other. It was quite a sight and
visitors came from all over the west to see this
magnificent hall and to dance in it.

Arthur and Millie themselves usually had
visitors in summers, for they were excellent
<span id="page-632"></span>
company and had many friends. Also, their relatives 
often came. Arthur's father, Laurs, spent
at least one summer helping on the ranch there.
Arthur's sister Elvena also came to stay with
them for a time and help Millie out. Few visited
in winters however, for these were very cold and
Upton folks were often snowed in. But the dances
went on there just the same.

The fall of 1915, when the twins were ready
to enter school for the first time, Arthur moved
the family back to Gunnison into their home they
had bought from his brother Chris "I". Grace
writes: -- "We moved back to Gunnison and mother
really had her hands full trying to get Gladys and
me ready for our first day at school. All our
things were handmade, even our bloomers and
hand knit stockings. How we longed for something
'store bought'. I recall so well the old rain barrel
that stood by our house. The soft rain water it held
was used for washing our long hair. One day, as
we children were all lined up for inspection, Wesley
backed into it. Gladys and I shrieked with delight
at the big splash - but we were silenced by a whop!
'You just simply have no regard for the efforts of
your mother' said our dad."

Later that fall Arthur bought the lovely red
brick house of his sister Elsie Bartholomew. She
was estranged from her husband at the time and
desired to move into less expensive quarters. He
traded the home they were living in in southwest
Gunnison in on the deal and Elsie and her children
moved into that old home, which had been built by
their brother Chris, and Arthur and his family
moved into the nice new home in the northeast part
of town. This was in the latter part of 1915, but
whether the move took place before the birth of
Arthur's and Millie's sixth child, David, 16 Nov.
1915, is not known for sure, although Millie's
sister Mary G. Dowdle says that David was probably 
born in the new red brick home. Grace
writes:-- "Our family moved into a handsome red
brick house. This was wonderful - pavement all
over, up to the barn, around the house, down to
the street - everywhere it seemed. We children
raced around in our little wagons."
<span id="page-633"></span>

Arthur leased a farm of some 327 acres
from Gussie Villard northwest a few miles from
Gunnison. His brother-in-law, Bert Gledhill,
worked for him here. Gladys writes: -- "After
we moved into the beautiful red brick house in
northwest Gunnison, I guess we didn't have much
money, as mother took in boarders. Then one
summer soon after, we almost cried when we
found out our dad and mother had rented our
beautiful house to some 'foreigners' and we were
going to move to the farm northwest of Gunnison."

Arthur moved his family back into the red
brick house the fall before their seventh child,
Max, was born, 17 Oct. 1920. Grace writes: -- "Gladys 
and I were going on twelve when Max was
born. He was the only one of us children that was
born in a hospital. Mother went to Salina and I
remember the concern that she might not make it.
It was shortly after this that Father and Mother
decided to go into the grocery business and politics.
Dad was persuaded by friends to run for Mayor of
Gunnison. He lost the race by about two votes.
Actually, he was relieved to have lost for his heart
wasn't in it - nor the grocery store either. He
longed to be back outside with the animals and the
soil - so took up farming again."

By the fall of 1924 both Melrose and Wesley
had gotten tired of no prospects in Gunnison except
farming and struck out on their own. They soon
found work in the mines in Juab County. Arthur
and Millie had the opportunity to buy a hotel in
Manti and Millie decided she wanted to try her
hand at it and so they sold their lovely home in
Gunnison and at Christmas time that year took
over the Eagle House hotel in Manti. Millie was
a hard worker, a great manager and a wonderful
cook. The twins, now in their Sophomore year in
high school, were a lot of help to her and soon
things were running smoothly.

Arthur left the running of the hotel to the
women. There seemed little need for him there
much of the time. He was an ambitious fellow
and a hard worker, growing restless when forced
to be idle too long. He finally went to the mine
where his two oldest sons were employed. Leola
<span id="page-634"></span>
Burraston, who later became his daughter-in-law,
wrote of this:-- "It was in 1927, I believe, when
Arthur first came to the mine. I was assistant
postmistress at the Tintic Standard Mining Co.
in Dividend. He worked in the mine for a few
months, You know he was never idle. Millie had
the hotel at Manti at that time. He used to talk to
me a good deal at that time. He was so much like
his son Wesley in manner - very quiet but so thoughtful 
and kind.

"In 1928 Arthur bought a ranch (in Flat Canyon) 
and asked Wes if he would like to quit at the
mine and help him at this time. Wes didn't really
want to leave Dividend but he loved his father
dearly and desired to be with him. He was underground 
and young and could see the benefits of
getting out into the open air and under God's 
sky - but mostly it was to be with his father that swung
the decision. Arthur wasn't really feeling too well
at this time but still he had come to the mine and
then the two of them left for Flat Canyon early in
the spring of 1928.

"A few months after they left Arthur became
very ill. He was a hemophiliac and even if he had
a tooth pulled he feared a hemorrhage. He suffered
from frequent nosebleeds and at that time he had a
particularly severe one. Wes rushed him to the
hospital in Salt Lake City, I believe."

Arthur recovered and was able to go back to
work. Later, Wesley returned to the mine in
Dividend. It was about that time that Arthur
received an opening with the Howell Livestock
Company. This was the company that had bought
out the Bennion Livestock Company sometime after
the death of his brother Chris "I", (about 1918).
Arthur went to work for this new company as foreman 
of their Trout Creek ranch, which was in
southern Utah out some distance from Delta and
close to the Nevada border. Here they produced
upwards of 4,000 turkeys yearly, which were
shipped to California and sold as "Howell's Holiday
Turkeys."

Though Trout Creek was quite a distance
from Manti, Arthur' came home on occasions and
<span id="page-635"></span>
Grace writes of one of these: -- "We were all
together for our parents' Silver Wedding anniversary, 
Feb. 3, 1929. The hotel was full of friends
from all over. Melrose pulled a real surprise.
He and Reva Giles, who had been married two days
before, unknown to any of us, chose this time and
place to make their announcement. The hat was
passed and they started off on their honeymoon.
Wesley and Leola Burraston were married a few
months later. Both boys met their wives in
Dividend."

Grace continues: -- "I often looked at my
mother and thought of the wonderful job she was
doing as manager of the hotel there in Manti.
Many times I marveled at her - truly a beautiful
woman, with warm brown eyes and classic features.
My father too was a handsome, honest and
kind man. He was the smallest of the Christensen
brothers, being of about average height but taller
than mother. I feel sad at times to think that they
were separated so much in their later years of
marriage."

Arthur was still working at Trout Creek in
November of 1931, as a letter written 5 Nov. 1931
by Max, then eleven, indicates, among other things.
It was written to Gladys who was then working in
Salt Lake and read as follows: -- "Dear Gladys,
how are you? Iam fine and so is the rest of the
family. We had a surprise today - Dad came home.
He is alright although he said he had a little pain
in his neck. . . Mother has dozed off to sleep in
her chair; Daddy is taking a bath; Jack Burns is
sitting listening to the radio. I don't know where
Dave is right now but I guess he will be home soon.
He and I have been playing with paper airplanes
tonight and having a lot of fun. Dave is going back
out with Dad to help pick feathers off the turkeys
for a couple of weeks. I wish I could go too.
Daddy says next time he comes home he will bring
us a lot of pinenuts. He says he likes the new boy
out there and that he sure is a good worker. Jack
Burns is still playing the radio. It seems it is
about nine o'clock and soon time for Amos and
Andy. . ." This letter was written on stationery
bearing the heading: "Eagle Hotel - Mrs. A. M.
<span id="page-636"></span>
Christenson, Prop. Home Like - Reasonable."

It was while ranching at Trout Creek, however, 
that Arthur's health began to fail desperately
and he was forced to return home. They were
shocked to see how pale and thin he had become.
A letter from Max to Gladys, 13 Oct, 1932, and a
postscript from Millie, follows: "Dear Gladys:
How are you all up there? We are all fine except
Daddy. He is pretty sick tonight. I received your
present the day before my birthday and thanks very
much. Grace gave me a pair of cords. Mama gave
me shorts and shirts and sox and let me have a
party. When I got my money all together it made
$2.00. We invited fifteen boys with myself and
served punch and cookies and had a melon bust.
Just when we got the melon we saw some smoke
and the siren started to sound and boy, did we go!
Some man said of us - 'There goes the fire squad'.
It was an old woodshed up by Mrs. Wilson's. Dave
has a swell new typewriter. It is soon halloween.
Mother is calling supper - so goodbye - Max." The
P.S, by Millie read: -- "Gladys, there isn't anything 
much to tell you and I am pretty busy. Have
a few railroad men and others here and Papa needs
waiting on. He is going to the hospital next week,
as soon as it is opened, and stay until he is better.
It is sure hard on all of us. Dave is going deer
hunting next week - love, Mother."

A letter from Millie to Gladys, Oct. 15, 1932,
follows:-- "Dear Gladys, I got your letter yesterday
just as we were leaving for Salina. I took Papa to
the hospital; he didn't feel as if he could make the
trip to Salt Lake. I'm almost afraid we've waited
too long and the future doesn't look too good. I
called Dr. Hagan Monday and he said to take him
to the Doctors Merrill. They gave him a thorough
examination and he was in no condition to have an
X-ray so he is taking medicine and trying to get
built up to have it next Monday.

"They found his blood pressure thirty degrees
too low and not enough red corpusles. They told
me on the side that he is in very bad shape and if
he ever gets well it will take months. They don't
think it's his stomach at all but in the blood. They
have sent some blood to Salt Lake to be tested for
<span id="page-637"></span>
diabetes. They could find no sugar in the urine
but think it may be in the blood and this test has
to be done in Salt Lake. He is in no pain much
now but so tired and weak. He sleeps all too much
and no matter what he eats or how much he is still
hungry. He looks bad and the last few days pale.
They may take him to Salt Lake, I don't know. The
hospital in Salina has closed but the doctors have
their offices there.

"I am all unstrung - haven't slept much for
three nights and am trying to get fruit put up. I
was gone all day yesterday. Grandma (Sorena)
stayed here. There is not much business right now.
Dave and Max are studying. I wish you would come
home more often. Grace was up to institute today
but I guess she didn't have time to run down and
see us. I had a letter from the boys (at Dividend);
they all had bad colds over there. Can't write anymore 
tonight - Mother."

Another letter from Millie to Gladys afew :
days later, Tues. 19 Oct. 1932, gave the 
following: -- "Dear Gladys, your last letter found me up
to my neck in peaches and plum jam. Hope I'll be
through with fruit this week. Dave took Papa to
Salina yesterday. They worked on him all day and
didn't finish. He has to go back Sunday. Seems
that they just can't find his trouble but know that
there is something wrong. They tested him again
for diabetes but found no trace of sugar. They
should have returns on the blood tests they sent to
Salt Lake, Sunday also. Now they think there is
an obstruction just at the place his stomach empties.
My, but it's a worry. He feels a little better today
and is starving but must have nothing but liquids.
He is almost too weak to walk.

"Grace called last night. She said she
couldn't study or do anything for thinking of him.
I will let you know if he gets worse. He is taking
medicine and Dr. Merrill seems to think it isn't
as serious as at first - but we will know more
after Sunday.

"Max is getting fat again and eats like a little
pig. He and Dave are studying; Papa is asleep; I
am baking bread and finishing my ironing. We have
<span id="page-638"></span>
sent for a new typewriter for Dave and he is a
happy boy about that. I wish you would go to see
Elaine and Pearl too. Answer soon - love,
Mother."

Arthur got no better and was rushed to the
Salina hospital. A card written by him from Salina
to Gladys in Salt Lake, Fri. 22 Oct. 1932, bore
this message: - "Dearest Gladys: Your letter and
parcel came this morning. Thanks a lot dear. I
surely appreciate it. The doctors says I am better!
I surely have a lot of distress. After I eat it seems
worse than before but I guess it just has to be. I
get along pretty good in the day but the nights are
bad. I cannot sleep very long at a time and lay
awake so much but am trying to get better. Haven't
heard from mother since you were here - guess she
is awfully busy. Hope I can get away from here
before too long. Best love, Dad."

Some two weeks later Arthur was taken from
the hospital in Salina to the L.D.S. hospital in Salt
Lake City to undergo an abdominal operation. He
was in serious condition. A letter from twelve
year old Max, written to him at Manti Nov. 30,
1932 and sent by way of Gladys in Salt Lake, was
as follows: "Dear Daddy: - How do you feel by now?
We sure all feel sorry for you and are hoping that
you will soon get well and come home. It sure 
seems lonesome around here and we all felt so bad
when they phoned and said you had to have a second
operation. I have the flu but I am lots better now.
Mama has a little cold tonight but I guess she will
get alright. She is now cooking supper. I am still
doing my beading work and I sure have made a lot
of bracelets and rings. It sure is fascinating. It
sure is warm down here now but it is cold sometimes.
We have the furnace going now. The
bottom part of it burned out but Dave fixed it
tonight with some pieces of iron.

"Dave has got one load of fat pinewood since
you left and maybe we will get another Saturday.
We went out last Saturday and got a load of barley.
We haven't killed our pig yet because mother said
she couldn't take care of it now. I am still busy
in my Scout work and doing fine. I sure wish I
could get up there to see you but I guess I can't
<span id="page-639"></span>
until you are ready to come home, which I hope is
soo. I am doing fine in school and I guess Dave
is too. We are all sure wishing you were well and
wondering how you feel tonight, but I guess it won't
do us any good to wonder. Loads of love - Max.
(And hurry and get well!)"

Arthur passed away 4 Dec. 1932 in Salt Lake
City at age fifty years four months and fifteen days.
A ruptured gall bladder was said to have contributed
to his death. He was brought to Manti for burial
which took place Sunday 7 Dec. 1932 in the Manti
Cemetery. He was laid on a plot belonging to his
brother Albert and sold to the family, not far from
the last resting place of his father and mother,
Laurs and Else K. Christensen. The burial was
preceeded by an impressive funeral service, an
account of which was carried by the Manti Messenger 
the following day, Dec. 8, 1932, under this
heading: - "Death Comes to Relieve Sufferer"

"True testimony of respect and love was
strongly pronounced Sunday afternoon for Arthur
M. Christensen when final rites were held at the
North Ward chapel where a host of friends and
associates had gathered to pay last respects.
Merciful death claimed the life of Arthur Thursday
evening at a Salt Lake hospital. The passing
relieved him of untold agony and suffering.

'Three weeks ago Arthur was taken to the
hospital for an abdominal operation. For a few
days his life hung by a thread but he was given
several blood transfusions and he seemed to be
on the road to recovery. Suddenly he became
worse and a second operation was necessary,
which was performed Wednesday, but only added
to his suffering. His wife and daughter Gladys
and son David were by his bedside at his passing.

"Bishop E. T. Reed was in charge of the
services which were as follows: Opening song by
the choir - 'Abide With Me'. Invocation was
offered by Elder Byron Peterson of Gunnison.
Other musical numbers were solos 'No Night
There' by Mrs. Sylvia Metcalf of Gunnison,
'Resignation' by Mrs. Elaine Southwick of Salt
Lake City, and 'Lay My Head Beneath the Rose'
<span id="page-640"></span>
by Sam Parry. Jose. A. Larson of Hamilton
Ward (Gunnison), Sherman Christensen of Provo,
Ray P. Lund of Manti, Mrs. D. Dally of Salt Lake
City, and Mrs. John Riddle of Manti were the
speakers. All touched on the friendly, cheerful
and honest disposition of the deceased. Benediction
was pronounced by Clyde Whitlock of Mayfield."

* * * * *

Amelia Jane Gledhill (Christensen ) wife of
Arthur Marinus Christensen, was born 26 Feb,
1882 at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the daughter of
Nephi and Sarah Jane Caldwell Gledhill, of English
descent. Later her family moved to Gunnison,
Utah and there is where "Millie", as she was
called, grew to womanhood, attending the schools
afforded by that community.

She belonged to a large family where girls
were in the majority and several of them very
talented in singing and entertaining. Two of her
younger sisters, Mary and Sylvia, sang together
a lot and were very good for that time. They sang
"Alexander's Ragtime Band" and "Whispering Hope"
for the first time in that part of the country.

Millie herself was talented not only in music but
in many other ways.

She was a very pretty girl with lovely hair
and soft brown eyes, almost classic features and
of rather small stature. She was very popular as
a girl and young woman and had many friends and
admirers, One of these early friends wrote to
her, many many years later, the following: --
"Millie, dearest friend of my girlhood, how I did
idolize you! You were so beautiful and did every-
thing so well, I recall so well the laughing sparkle
of your eyes and the way your hair looked. How
I did wish I could be like you. . . . It is impossible
to express the gratitude I feel for friends like you.
God love you and keep you - lovingly, Eva,"

It was necessary for the Gledhill girls, as
well as the boys, to work when and where they
could out of the home. Mostly it was housework
for the girls unless one was fortunate enough to
get a position as salesgirl with a mercantile
<span id="page-641"></span>
establishment or take up school teaching. When
the new Gunnison Telephone Company was incorporated in 1909, in which Leo Gledhill took an
important part, Mary Gledhill operated the mag-
netic switchboard on the second floor of the post-
office building. Several years before, Mary
worked for Albert and Jennie Christensen in Manti
when their oldest son, Sherman, was born.

Millie went to work for Laurs and Else K.
Christensen, whom everyone called Grandpa and
Grandma, two and a half blocks east of the Gledhill
home. They were operating a boarding house at
the time and employed two girls, Millie helped
with the housework and the cooking and doubtless
learned a great deal about Danish cooking from
Else K. It was at this time that she became very
interested in the youngest Christensen son, Arthur,
a handsome blond young man with blue eyes. A
romance soon developed between the two and continued
for several years, during part of which time
Arthur attended the B. Y. A. in Provo.

Millie and Arthur were married in the beautiful 
Manti Temple on Wednesday 3 Feb, 1904. Millie
was nearly twenty-two and Arthur was some five
months younger. A history of the first few years
of their married life has been given briefly in
Arthur's life story, but the birth of their twin
girls is given more in detail by the oldest of the
twins, Grace, and by Millie's sister Mary Gledhill (Dowdle). Mrs. Dowdle writes: - "When the
twins, Grace and Gladys, were born, Grace, a
large, blond Christensen baby, came first, not
long before midnight on 16 Feb. 1909. Two hours
later, 17 Feb. 1909, Gladys, atiny, sickly, dark
complexioned baby came. Millie, in her hysteria,
refused to own the second twin so the doctor put
her in my charge. I cared for this baby in my
room at home for two weeks and fed her with an
eye-dropper a combination of whiskey and some-
thing else which Dr. Hagan mixed up, Later Millie
was able to nurse both her babies and one other
baby who wasn't getting enough milk, Joseph's
and Roxie's Virgil."

Grace writes: - "My parents were proud and
happy with their enlarged family, four children
<span id="page-642"></span>
under the age of four. Then too, the way things
happened was quite the talk of the town - twins
born on different days. We were quite a drain on
mother's health, so I've been told, so it was decided
that Dad's sister, Aunt Vena, would take care of me
and mother's sister, Aunt Mary, would take Gladys
until mother should regain her strength.

"As I remember, or have been told, the rock
house in southwest Gunnison where we were born
was a square structure with an upstairs and balcony.
The water we used was taken from a well close to
the back door and for light we used kerosine lamps.
In fact, Dr. Hagan bumped his head on the hanging
lamp when he delivered us twins, Gladys and me.
I heard the grownups talk and joke so much about
this that I actually thought I had seen it. 'Well', I
told the folks when they questioned my remembering, 'I was there and heard the bang.'"

When the twins were going on two the family
moved to a ranch in Upton, Utah. The four years
spent there were mostly pleasant ones in spite of
the death of a day old baby girl, Mildred, their
fifth child, 18 Jan. 1912 at Coalville, where
Millie had gone to be near a doctor. The small
community of Upton with its some forty families,
mostly LDS, was a sociable town and many good
times were had there. Millie and Arthur especially
enjoyed the dances, Millie had her own saddlehorse
and drove the two-seated buggy in which she and the
children could come and go at will, even when the
menfolk were busy.

Moving back to Gunnison the fall of 1915, in
time to put the twins into school, Millie later had
the thrill of moving into the large and beautiful
"red-brick house! in time for the birth of her sixth
child and third son, David, 16 Nov. 1915. Arthur
was away much of the time on Bennion Livestock
Company business and when she was able, Millie
took in boarders, school teachers mostly,

She always kept her children looking nice,
The twins she dressed alike and kept their hair in
ringlets most of the time. They looked like little
dolls, Grace with her blond curls and blue eyes
and Gladys with her dark hair and dark eyes, She
<span id="page-643"></span>
didn't neglect the girls' musical education either,
for she was determined that they would learn both
to play the piano and sing. I remember so well
going to the red brick house one time to visit,
when the twins were about eight. Millie, as proud
as she could be, had them stand up and sing to-
gether, with appropriate actions, the song "I don't
Want to Play in Your Yard." I can still see them
in my mind's eye and hear their sweet, childish
voices, as if it were yesterday.

It was at Millie's and Arthur's red brick
house that the Laurs and Else K. Christensen
family gathered to have a family photograph taken,
about the time they brought the oldest son, Chris
"T" from Wyoming for his burial in Gunnison, 12
Oct. 1917. It was in this home that they met later
in an inspiring family meeting, vowing to meet
from then on in yearly family reunions and to keep
closer together as a family.

When Millie and Arthur leased a farm northwest
of Gunnison and decided to move there, they
rented the red brick house. The children were
able to do a lot on the farm in summers and
Millie's younger brother, Bert, came to work for
them also. Millie made delicious butter and sold
it to the stores in Gunnison in wrappers with her
own name printed on them. This was always in
demand. In her own history, the daughter Gladys
comments on life on the farm: - "There was a two-roomed 
house on the farm and it was really surprising
how warm and comfortable mother made it
look, although it was rather crowded for our family
of seven, Mother wanted to be sure that Grace and
my muSical educations were not neglected, so down
to the farm went our piano, and every week there
were music lessons in town with plenty of: practicing
in between.

Millie once told of how sad she was when
their two older boys, Melrose and Wesley, left _
home to look for work, She watched them walking
up the road carrying their suitcases, trying to
"thumb" their way north, as long as her eyes
could follow them - and then broke down and wept.
It is not a happy experience for a mother when her
first "chicks" leave the home and Millie was no
<span id="page-644"></span>
exception. In fact she was a very doting mother,
withall.

The move to Manti at Christmastime of 1924
and the taking over of the Eagle House hotel there
was a very challenging experience for Millie, but
she was equal to it in every way. She was a fine
cook, a good housekeeper, an excellent manager,
and people liked her. Besides, she seemed to be
an indefatigable worker and her health was good.
The fact that those years ahead, which then looked
so promising, should be saddened by the long illness
and untimely death of her dear husband, was a sorrow
to her indeed and left her very lonely. Two
letters written by her soon after his death, 4 Dec.
1932, one to her son Melrose, whom she called
"Rosy", and his family and one to her daughter
Gladys, who had both been home to their father's
funeral but returned to their homes in Salt Lake
City, show in a measure her sorrow but mostly
her courage: -

"Wed. 10 Dec. 1932, Dear Ones: Received
your card this A.M. Rosy, glad everything was
fine when you arrived home. I forgot about Melvin's
birthday (Dec. 5th) just when you left and felt
sorry about that. Iam sending him a small package
today. The boys and I went to Gunnison late
Sunday afternoon right after you left. It seemed so
lonesome and awful here. We spent the evening at
Leo's (her brother) and left Grace for work next
morning. When we returned the house seemed so
empty and cold we three slept together. I'm so
thankful for Dave and Max. Last night Max said
to Dave, 'We can't both go to Mutual, we've got to
take turns staying with mother.' So Dave stayed.
Before the night was over seven people came in
and I have just given them breakfast. The lamb-buyers
came back. I have a hired girl to help me
house clean and catch up with so many neglected
jobs. She is ironing. We washed yesterday and
had the pig killed. I'll send you some when I get
at it.

"I may go to Salt Lake this weekend, There
are bills and so much to tend to and we can do our
Christmas shopping. Grace wants to go. I had to
go to the bank this morning and borrow some money
<span id="page-645"></span>
until the insurance check comes. I don't know how
long that will take. I had spent about my last $1.00,
Everything will be alright and I'm glad I have work
and can keep on 'keeping on'. So many people have
called to see me and I have a stack of letters and
cards, some from old friends I'd almost forgotten.
Our old crowd from Gunnison are coming up to-
night - about 20. It's grand to have friends and
you don't know how proud I am of you all, Folks
never get through telling me how wonderful my
children are - and you are wonderful and that's
what keeps me up and trying to be brave. Write
often to your lonely mother."

It seems Millie and Grace did go to Salt Lake
that weekend, Grace was teaching school in Gunnison
at the time. On their return, Millie made a.
report to Gladys: - "Monday nite, 15 Dec. 1932.
Dear Gladys - This has been the coldest day I have
ever seen and tonight it is 20&deg; below zero. Grace
and Theron had a terrible time this morning before
they got to Gunnison. I told them to take the Buick
(they couldn't start the Ford) but all of us together
couldn't start the Buick either. Theron got a car
from the Motor Company to push it but that didn't
help. They pushed it way down by the fairgrounds
but it was all froze up. Theron finally started his
car, then towed the Buick into the garage. I'll
leave it there to have it overhauled and fixed for
Christmas, About 10:30 a.m. Metcalf (Principal
of the Gunnison school where Grace taught), phoned
and said they had to dismiss school because they
couldn't get the schoolhouse warm and everything
was frozen up. Theron and Grace got there in
plenty of time for the afternoon, however.

"We arrived home from Salt Lake about three
yesterday. Everything was ok but thank goodness
we didn't stay another night or everything would
have been frozen up. My flowers were alright.
We found Max sick at Uncle Albert's (in Provo).
He had been sick all the time we were gone but
they had been so good to him and kept him in. He
is feeling better tonight but still has the earache.
I didn't wash today but have been cleaning upstairs -
had Fanny in to help me. A letter was here from
Uncle Bert saying he would be here right after the
<span id="page-646"></span>
15th. (He came from Nevada and helped Millie
dispose of the Flat Canyon ranch.)

"We stopped at Aunt Mary's (in Payson) and
had chili, She had an awful cold. Iwill send you
a check for Grace. Be sure her coat is sent insured
and right. There has been no bill from the hospital
yet. Guess I'll go crawl in bed with the boys to get
warm. It's lonesome tonight. Love - mother.
P.S. I received a nice long letter from Aunt Sarah
today, also from Edith, Elaine, Sherman, Bell and
Neil. And all of my Gunnison friends have written
or called."

Grace was married less than a month after
her father's death. The Manti Messenger carried
the announcement: - "Mrs. A, M. Christensen
announces the marriage of her daughter Grace to
Mr. Douglas Larsen of Salt Lake City, which took
place at Richfield, Tuesday Jan, 3rd (1933), Immediately
following the ceremony the newlyweds left for
a ten day visit in southern California. Grace is one
of Manti's popular young ladies, having been active
in the social life of our city. She is a graduate of
the High School and also Snow College, and for the
past number of years has been teaching at Gunnison.
Mr. Larsen is at present working for the State Road
Commission at Parawan, After March Ist the young
couple will make their home in Salt Lake City."

Millie stayed on keeping the hotel in Manti for
another three and a half years, with the help of
David and Max. Then she decided to sell out and
move to Salt Lake City, where some of her older
children were then residing. She bought a home at
636 East 3rd South in Salt Lake. A letter to Gladys
about the last of April 1936 follows:-- "Dear
Gladys: . . . Uncle Albert was down Saturday to
see me about my abstract of title, etc. We had it
all drawn up and thought it all ok, but their attorneys
up there said it was not clear - no right of way over the creek and some other flaws. He was supposed to have gone to Salt Lake yesterday to have it all fixed up. I expect a call anytime to go
to Salt Lake to close the deal. Can you go up and
take care of the house until school closes here? I
hate to take Max out of school and the home there
should have someone in it. I'll bring up bedding
<span id="page-647"></span>
and enough things for you and Margaret to get along
until we move, which will be in a couple of weeks.

"We are awfully busy. Steve and Chris are
here besides a number of other men. One thing
sure, the Wimmer folks will take over a housefull.
We have a nice service station now on the corner
and Rastus is moving his dump away. Grace was
home most of last week. I surely hope Rosy is
having some business but somehow I worry about
them. I stayed home all day Sunday and worked
as usual. Dave had the car. He at last has found
a job (making brick) now that we are ready to move.
Such weather - it's awful today - cold and stormy.
Don't do anything about moving until you see or
hear from me again. Would you be afraid to live
in the home until we come?"

After nearly eleven and a half years as oper-
ator and manager of the Eagle House Hotel in Manti,
Millie took up her residence in Salt Lake City. But
she did not remain unemployed long, for she
accepted a position with Auerbach's Company in
the alterations. department and remained in their
employ for some seven years. On Mar. 1940
she married Octavious F. Gudmundson, an engineer
on the U. P. railroad. The family all called him
"Goodie" and welcomed him into the fold.

Grace writes: - "The big home mother bought
in Salt Lake proved to be a gathering place for
children and grandchildren. David had graduated
from Manti High School and Max attended West
High there in Salt Lake. Douglas and I had moved
to Salt Lake and were also living with mother.
Gladys also lived with mother and remained there
until 1942, when she left for San Francisco, Our
daughter Maxine Sydney was born while we were
living there, 17 Oct. 1943. We had brother Max
as her godfather for he was by that time in the
Navy and on the aircraft carrier Enterprise.

"In August 1950 Doug and I bought our present
home on Emerson Ave. Soon after mother sold
her big home and purchased a duplex near Liberty
Park, 1333 South 6th East. David and his family
bought and lived in one side of the duplex and
mother and Goodie in the other. Goodie died there
<span id="page-648"></span>
20 Aug. 1951." His obituary notice was as follows: -
"Octavious F, Gudmundson, 75, retired U. P.
worker dies at Salt Lake residence, 1333 South 6th
East. Born 7 May 1876 in Fairview, Utah, a son
of Samuel and Inger Olsen Gudmundson, Filled a
mission for the Church to Norway, 1900-1903.
Married lst. Anna Mae Clark (div.); md, 2nd
Millie Gledhill Christensen. Died 20 Aug. 1951;
buried 24 Aug. 1951."

Millie had numerous friends in Salt Lake and
she continued to remain active, She was always
most thoughtful and considerate of her many relatives
and never missed an opportunity to be of
service to them. She was a member of the McKay
Ward, Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and the
"Silver Crest Club", a social group of ladies whom
she enjoyed very much. They had such good times
together. Though Millie's later years were saddened
by the death of her son Wesley, at 48, the grueling
service of her son Max during the second world war
as a crewman of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
which had ten announced battles to its credit,
including the raid on Tokyo, and his long illness
that resulted as well as the serious illness of her
son Melrose, yet she kept her courage and went
forward, doing all she could for her family and
friends. Her own health remained comparatively
- good and she continued to keep very busy.

She passed away rather suddenly at her home
of cardiac failure, Wed. Nov. 1, 1961 at 2 p.m.
She was seventy-nine years eight months and six
days old, She had outlived her husband Arthur
twenty-nine years lacking one month. She was
survived by three sons and two daughters, twelve
grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, five
sisters and two brothers. Funeral services were
held at the Mortuary at 36 East 7th South in Salt
Lake City at 10 a.m. Sat. 4 Nov, 1961 and burial
was later that day in the Manti City Cemetery,
where she was placed beside her beloved husband
Arthur.

Millie's oldest son, Melrose, followed her
in death exactly one week to the day (Wed. 8 Nov.
1961) in Salt Lake City. He was buried exactly a
week following her burial (Sat, 11 Nov. 1961) in

the Mt. Olivet Cemetery there. This was indeed
a sad time for the A. M. Christensen family.

## ELVENA CHRISTENSEN (CLARK)

Elvena [Elvine in Else K.'s entry on her birth], 
eleventh and last child and ninth
producing branch of the Laurs M. C. and Else K.
Christensen family, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah 27 Mar. 1887. She was born in the "new rock
house" in northwest Gunnison. According to
information recorded in her mother's journal she
was born about 9 o'clock at night on a Sunday. Her
mother also recorded that she was blessed and
named at home the 7th of April by Norien. (This
last is hard to read and perhaps misspelled.) She
also recorded that the child was taken to church
for her official blessing and naming, 23 Dec. 1889,
which was done by Bishop A. C. Madsen. The
name given her, Elvena, was according to an old
Danish custom of naming children - viz: If the
eighth child was a boy he was named Otto, if the
eleventh child was a girl she was named Elevena,
etc. Elevena was shortened to Elvena in this case
but she was later called "Vena" more often than not.

Elvena's mother was a trained doctress and
midwife and her time was much in demand in
Gunnison Valley. Thus the child was often left in
the care of other members of the family. When
she was one year and two months old, her mother
brought home another little baby girl to raise, Ada
Lorena Madsen, two months and twelve days old.
Elvena's mother had delivered the little girl and
taken care of her and her mother during the long
period of the mother's illness. Knowing that she
would die, the young mother had begged the older
woman to take her baby and raise her as her own.
So when Ada's mother passed away, Elvena's
mother brought little Ada to the Christensen home
to live. The two babies, blond, healthy Elvena
and dark haired, sickly little Ada took to each
other right away and became almost inseparable
as the days and years went by.

There was great excitement in Sanpete Valley
<span id="page-650"></span>
and in fact in the whole of Utah that spring of 1888,
for the beautiful Manti Temple had just been completed. 
A three day dedicatorial celebration was
held in the Temple and some in attendance spoke
of hearing "a heavenly chorus singing" and of other
manifestations of divine approval. The main dedication 
service took place 21 May 1888 and the
dedicatory prayer was offered by President Lorenzo
Snow. This was the third holy temple to be dedicated
in Zion and the Saints gathered from all over for the
occasion.

When Elvena was three and a half, Sept. 1890,
her mother left for a three months trip to her native
land of Denmark to visit her relatives who still
resided there. She took little two-and-a-half year
old Ada with her, not daring to leave the frail child
in the care of others for that length of time. If
three-and-a-half year old Elvena's nose was a bit
"out of joint" because she was left home we could
not entirely blame her. Yet being of so sweet and
loving a disposition she probably "took it in her
stride" after the first wave of disappointment had
ebbed. Her oldest sister Elsie stayed out of school
those three months to look after things and her father
also helped as well as her thirteen-year-old sister
Emma, whom Elvena adored. But she must have
been a happy child when her mother and Ada
returned home, about Christmastime that year,
bringing greetings and gifts from cousins in
Denmark.

Ada passed away the winter of 1897, not long
before Vena turned ten. This must have been a sad
experience for Vena since she and Ada had been so
very fond of each other. Being forced to part from
a loved one can make quite an impression on one of
this age, especially of Vena's sensitive nature--when 
the bonds of love have been so closely knit.
Vena missed the little invalid Ada terribly. That
feeling of loss must have been somewhat assuaged,
however, when another little girl who needed a home
was taken in by the Christensens soon after school
started the next fall. Vena's new companion in the
home was Tresia, a little Swedish girl about two
years younger than herself - but wiser in the ways
of the world. She was treated like one of the family
<span id="page-651"></span>
for, as Tresia herself said, "If Vena got a new
dress I got a new dress and if Vena got new shoes
I got new shoes." Tresia remembers that both
she and Vena wore new shoes the night they drove
up to Manti in the two-seated buggy with "Papa and
Mama" as she called Vena's parents, to attend the
wedding reception of "brother Albert" and his wife
Jennie, 26 Sept. 1900. Vena was thirteen-and-a-half 
and Tresia past eleven-and-a-half at the time.
Though quite different in temperament and experience, 
these two girls learned to love each other
dearly and established a deep friendship that
existed as long as they both lived.

Vena's two brothers just older, Arthur and
Louis, were great teases and played many pranks
on her; like the time they put her down the well
where she was supposed to hide for a game and
then went off and forgot to bring her back up; and
the time they induced her to lay down in the ditch
where the bridge was supposed to be, to rise up
and frighten their mother when she came at dusk
with the buckets of swill to feed the pigs, but she
got stepped on and doused with the filthy swill
instead; or the time when the boys had been
punished and sent to bed upstairs without their
suppers and they dressed her up like a "poor"
child, well disguised in a shawl, and sent her to
beg some food from their mother for her "starving 
brothers and sisters", but got a good spanking
instead. The guileless Vena was the victim of
their pranks so often that it was surprising she
didn't catch on to them - and perhaps she did after
a time.

Vena attended the public school in Gunnison.
One of her school chums was Rose Bartholomew
(Peterson), recently deceased. Rose said that she
and Vena were almost inseparable in their youth.
They graduated from the eighth grade together and
since there was no high school in Gunnison at the
time this was all the formal schooling that they had.
Vena's brother Joseph was their teacher in eighth
grade and also the Principal.

Vena grew to be a very pretty young woman,
tall and slender with a fair skin, large blue eyes
and the most beautiful, almost golden colored hair.
<span id="page-652"></span>
I remember at one time my mother Jennie bought
a beautiful piece of gold colored satin for a dress for 
Vena because it would "go so well with her lovely
hair". On one occasion Vena was chosen as the
"Goddess of Liberty" for a Fourth of July celebration 
in Gunnison, for which that town was famous,
and she rode on the main float in the parade, decked
out in a long white flowing robe girded with a long
braided satin cord, and with a golden colored crown
on her upswept, beautifully arranged golden colored
hair. She also sat in state in the patriotic assembly
which followed. Truly she must have been a picture
of loveliness!

In the winter of 1909 her parents sold the rock
house in which she had been born and grown to
womanhood and moved to Manti to be near the
temple, for they were so interested in doing their
genealogy. Vena, still unwed at twenty-two and the
only child at home, moved along with them. She
often used to tell that no matter how old or tall she
had become, her mother Else always introduced her
to new people as her "baby". The embarrassed girl
used to counter by saying, "brother Arthur is the
baby boy", but could never hide her blushes. She
was so timid and modest around strangers.

Vena seldom stayed at home in Manti however,
for she was so much in demand by her sisters and
brothers to assist in their homes and with their
families. She was always so capable and willing
that it is easy to see how she may have been imposed
upon at times by those she loved. We doubt if she
seldom or ever refused or complained. Whenever
there was any need in any of the Christensen families, 
the call went out for "Vena"! She was truly
an angel of mercy to each and everyone of them.

In midsummer of 1910 Vena's parents left for
a three months trip to Denmark to visit their relatives 
and search out more of their genealogy. Her
father still had his only living brother residing there
whom he had not seen in forty-four years, or since
before he left the Old Country the spring of 1866.
Her mother of course had been back twenty years
before and established a close relationship once
again with her three Danish sisters and one brother
and their families living there. They had corresponded
<span id="page-653"></span>
often during those twenty years. When they
learned that "Aunt Else" was returning to Denmark
some of Vena's Danish girl cousins about her age
wrote begging that "Cousin Elvena" be allowed to
come along. What could have been more wonderful
than for Vena to have made this trip to Denmark
with her parents, especially since her brother
Andrew and his family would be joining them from 
Germany where Andrew was studying? Why she
didn't go we do not know. Perhaps she was too
timid, not knowing the Danish language, but more
likely it was because of the great expense of such
a trip.

That autumn, while her parents were still
away, Vena's brother Albert's family was stricken
with scarlet fever. The daughter Elaine came down
with it just as they were preparing to move into a
lovely new home in Manti. They had sold their old
home so Elaine was taken by her mother to her
grandfather Snow's home where they were both
quarantined in for some weeks. Vena's help was
sought and she accepted the responsibility of being
quarantined in with the other three children, Virginia, 
Sherman and Hale, nine, five-and-a-half
and three-and-a-half respectively. Albert rented
a large furnished room in a dilapidated rock house
belonging to old Mr. Henry that stood just across
the fence south of the new house and into this moved
Vena and the three children. Albert was of course
quarantined out of both places, because of his work,
but took care of the extra needs of all.

How well I recall being penned up in that long,
dark room with our beds at one end, a cooking
stove, cupboards and makeshift sink at the other,
and a large round table in between where we ate
our meals and carried on many of our other
activities. This table was centered by a large
fancy kerosene lamp and here Aunt Vena played
solitaire with cards in the evenings after the little
boys had gone to bed, while I worked at pencil
games or read a book. How Aunt Vena loved to
play solitaire! But her sunny disposition and
cheerful ways brightened our lives and kept us
mostly contented in our locked-in condition. The
brightest time of all each day, however, was when
Daddy came with our groceries and special treats
<span id="page-654"></span>
for all. Happily none of us took the disease so we
were able to move out of there and into our new
home as soon as the quarantine was lifted.

Vena had worked at the woolen mills in Provo
for a short time several years before, when Andrew
and Sarah lived there, and stayed at their place; but
she had never really been "away to work". Tresia
had left the Christensen home to go to work in Salt
Lake City when she was sixteen and never returned
except for visits. The tales of her escapades must
have given Vena a longing to see something of the
big city, make her own money and spend it on
luxuries and be independent as it were. Tresia
always had such beautiful bonnets, shoes, dresses
and rustling silk petticoats when she came back to
visit.

It must have been soon after her parents had
returned from Europe that Vena gained their consent 
to go to Salt Lake City to find employment.
She could live with Caroline, the wife of her brother
Chris, since Caroline was in need of adult company
at nights, Chris being away much of the time on
Bennion Livestock Company business, for he was
the manager. Vena got a job at the Hotel Utah
working in the linen room and here she was employed 
for several years. Doubtless she had been
duly cautioned beforehand by her mother and others
to "beware of strangers - especially males", for
Tresia says that during all the time she worked at
the hotel she never spoke to the male guests if she
could help it nor ever once touched the boxes of
candy and money they left for her as tips. She
possessed a moral integrity that could not be
questioned. Some may have called her "old
fashioned" but she should have been envied by the
less scrupulous.

She eventually gave up her work at the Hotel
Utah and went where she was most needed among
members of her family - to be with Elsie and her
children on the ranch in Wyoming - to help Emma
bottle fruit or cook for threshers - to be with
Albert's motherless children when his wife Jennie
passed away in 1916. Fortunate is the family who
has an "Aunt Vena" to love and care for them in
times of need! Her numerous nieces and nephews
<span id="page-655"></span>
all learned to adore her without exception and with
good cause.

But Vena longed for children of her own. Her
brother Chris "I" was largely responsible in getting
her interested in a fine fellow about her age named
George T. Clark - and in getting George interested
in Vena. George had worked for Chris for a number 
of years as one of the herders of the Bennion
Livestock Company and he had found him to be
honest, hard working, clean living and most
dependable, besides having a very kind disposition
and being a bachelor. Chris felt that George would
make an excellent husband for Vena, who was pressing 
thirty, and he had a great desire to see his
youngest sister happily married.

George was a native of Upton, Utah, and as
a company herder must have often gone to the Company 
ranch in Upton for supplies when Vena's brother
was operating that ranch. Whether Vena ever met
George while visiting Arthur and Millie at Upton we
cannot be certain. Arthur and family left Upton the
autumn of 1915 and moved back to Gunnison, and
Vena seemed to have no visions of a prospective
marriage at the time she was taking care of her
brother Albert's motherless children in 1916/17,
or she would have told them. She was still at
Albert's the middle of June 1917, as attested to by
the following excerpt from Elaine's journal dated
16 June 1917: - "We've worked hard carrying
benches, tables, Victrola and lights out to the
lawn for our lawn party. Dear Aunt Vena has
worked so hard cooking and sewing for us. . ."

It must have been very soon after that, however, 
that Vena left Manti and went to the ranch in
Wyoming to visit her sister Elsie and children and
others of her relatives living there. Chris had
helped her file on some homestead land close to
the others on The Oasis and she was supposed to
live on it a certain part of each year and make
improvements on it as Louis, Elsie and others
were doing. Her brother Chris, the sly one, must
have taken this opportunity to get Vena and George
Clark together somehow and the spark was lighted.
Their romance grew rapidly, fostered by Chris
and the others, and it was not many weeks before
<span id="page-656"></span>
Vena and George had decided to get married.

They went to the Uinta county seat at Evanston,
Wyoming for their license and were married there
by the L. D. S. Bishop, 14 Aug. 1917. Both were
thirty at the time. Much of the credit for this marriage 
could be given to the cupid with reddish
whiskers, Chris "I". His daughter Pearl says that
the couple went to Salt Lake City right after their
marriage and spent the first night of their honeymoon 
at her mother Caroline's home. She remembers her 
mother telling about the large straw hat
Vena was wearing, trimmed with a large bunch of
gay colored artificial flowers. Somehow during the
night the cat got hold of that hat and tore it all to
pieces, and that was the end of Vena's wedding
bonnet.

From Salt Lake they went on to Manti where
Vena showed George off to her Sanpete County relatives.
Then it was back to The Oasis in Wyoming,
where they lived with Elsie while George built a
house on Vena's property, a two-roomed log house
with an attic. Chris gave George work on or near
the ranch so that he could be near his new bride.
George helped with the harvesting of the crops on
Chris' place that fall and he was there when the
crops were burned and, shortly afterwards, when
the wonderful Chris "I" was shot and died. He
helped a great deal at that time.

Vena must have gone home to live with her
parents that winter in Manti while George went out
again with the sheep. Returning to Wyoming in
early spring she was able to live in her own log
house, which was not too far from her sister
Elsie's or her brother Louis' log and frame houses.
George was able to be home off and on but by July
Vena had returned to Manti to be near the help of
her mother for the birth of her first child.

Vera was born in Manti at the home of her
Christensen grandparents, 12 July 1918, and was
delivered by her grandmother Else. Tresia says
Vena had a very hard time of it. She took baby
Vera back up on the Oasis in Wyoming to live as
soon as she was able, for she wanted to "prove up"
on her land. It wasn't too long after the end of that

year that the Bennion Livestock Company was sold
and all of the Christensens, except Louis and his
family, had sold or given up their land there and
left the area.

That winter (1918/19) Vena went again to
live with her parents in Manti and it was perhaps
the next spring that George joined her there. They
were encouraged to stay on in Utah and Vena's
brother Albert gave George work on his Gunnison
ranch, a mile or so west of Gunnison. There was
plenty for George to do looking after the feeding of
the sheep and cattle on the ranch. He and Vena
and small Vera lived at Vena's sister Emma's that
winter and it was at the Peterson home that their
second child, Alta, was born (Feb. 1921). In the
spring of 1921 George and Vena and their two little
girls moved into the small farm house on the Gunnison 
ranch and it was here that their third daughter,
Tresia, was born in May 1922. Emma took care
of one year old Alta for them at that time. There
was always so much love between Emma and Vena
that they could scarcely help each other enough.

In her own history their oldest daughter,
Vera Clark (Lyons) recalls some of the things she
has been told about life on that Gunnison 
ranch: -- "Ivan Lyons' folks were also farming west of
Gunnison, for the Mellors, and my folks and his
visited back and forth and played cards together.
They would do the chores at night, get out the
horse and wagon, then, taking us children with
them, go and spend the night at Lyons' visiting
and playing cards while we slept, then go back
home next morning in time to do the chores again.
Lyons' boy Ivan, two-and-a-half years older than
I,tried to lift me over a ditch once and dropped
me into the water. He remembers this well because 
his Dad gave him a licking for it. I was not
much more than four at the time. (Ivan Lyons
later became Vera's husband).

The summer of 1922 Albert gave George
work on the Star Ranch north of Nephi and that
fall George moved his family to Goshen, not far
north of there, and went to work in the mines at
Dividend, Utah, where his brother-in-law, Alma
Bartholomew, had employment. Alma and Elsie
<span id="page-658"></span>
also lived in Goshen. Vera writes: "The folks
rented a place in Goshen across from the George
Burraston family who were always fine neighbors
and have always been good friends ever since. Dad
finally bought a little home across the road from
mother's sister and her husband, Aunt Elsie and
Uncle Alma Bartholomew."

It was in Goshen that Vena gave birth to her
fourth daughter, LaFay, Sept. 1923, and it was
there in Nov. 1924 that their first son, George
Fern Clark, was born. Two years later, in Nov.
of 1926, another daughter, Lorraine, was born to
Vena and George. This was a difficult winter for
them because the children had so much sickness.
Vera writes of this: - "The year I was in the third
grade was a tough one for us. We had measles,
mumps, chicken pox, and also scarlet fever. I had
scarlet fever and LaFay had measles at the same
time. Mother said the doctor came every day to
see both of us but he thought I was going to die and
that LaFay would get well, but it turned out just the
opposite, for LaFay took pneumonia and passed
away 24 Feb. 1927. I remember the morning she
died. Alta and I were awake and mother wrapped
us in quilts and took us into the room where she
lay. We were under quarantine and the only one
who could leave the place was Dad. He went to
work, did our shopping and all.

"LaFay's funeral services were held on our
lawn and they placed her casket just inside the
front door. It was the last of February and very
cold and mother sat weeping with us children all
around her wrapped up in quilts and three-and-a-half 
month old Lorraine on her lap. None of us
were able to go to the cemetery because of the
quarantine, except Dad who took her to the Goshen
Cemetery and buried her, with the help of relatives
and neighbors who had gathered for the occasion."

One more child, a second boy named LaMar,
was born to Vena and George in Goshen. There
were happy times along with the sad times there.
Vera writes: - "I can remember mother and dad
going to dances now and again in Goshen, They 
took me to a Valentine's dance once where the
women brought box lunches and the men drew for
<span id="page-659"></span>
them. Mother and Dad both loved to dance and
Dad was an especially good dancer. When I grew
older the dance I had with him at every dance we
both attended was the thrill of the evening."

Vera continues: - "We moved to Santaquin
on April 1st 1930, just before I finished sixth
grade, but I was still promoted. Dad had bought
a lot there with no house on it, so we rented a
house on the same block until he could build on
it. He moved the big garage from our place in
Goshen onto our lot in Santaquin. It made two
rooms into which we moved. Later he added
other rooms." Tresia writes: - "In my second
year of school we moved to Santaquin. I remember
spending hours and hours moving rocks from the
ground before Dad could plant a garden. We rented
until enough of our own house was finished for us
to move in. Then we only had lanterns to see by at
nights for some weeks and I remember how wonderful 
it seemed when we got electricity into the house."

Mary Gledhill Dowdle said that the Christensen 
and Gledhill girls were always close friends
through the years, as were the Christensens and
Bartholomews. Mary lived in Payson while Vena
lived in Santaquin and she says while living in
Santaquin that Vena used to entertain her neighbors
and friends at a program and musical regularly
every month in her home. Although none of their
children had any musical talent to speak of, George
bought her a piano more or less for these occasions.
Vena loved music, as did her sisters Elsie and
Emma, and though she never had any special
training she taught herself to play the piano some.
Mary said that Vena loved people and that her
sweet ways and thoughtfulness of others endeared
her to all who knew her. Mary also said that Vena
attended Relief Society and other church meetings
faithfully and that she had one of the fondest dreams
of her life realized when George took her to the 
"House of the Lord" and they and their six younger
children were sealed for time and eternity. (Another 
daughter, Viola, had been born in Payson in
June 1931, about a year after they moved to
Santaquin.)

Vena was the only one of the Christensen
<span id="page-660"></span>
brothers and sisters who hadn't yet had her temple
work done and this had worried her more as time
went on and the children grew older. It took a near
tragedy in George's and Vena's lives, however, to
get them to the temple. Tresia tells of 
this: - "The spring my oldest sister Vera was married
(Apr. 1938) on Easter Sunday. I was with a group
of young friends in a car when we had a terrible
accident. I was badly injured and not expected to
live for a time, my face being cut almost from
ear to ear and other damage. I was unconscious
for quite a period and the first time I saw my
father, after regaining consciousness, I told him
that I was concerned that he and mother had not
been to the temple to be sealed for eternity. This
seemed to be constantly on my mind after the accident 
and I remembered mother worrying about my
sisters Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she
and Dad had us children sealed to them. I exacted
a promise from Dad at that time that they would
prepare to go to the temple before my eighteenth
birthday.

"My parents did prepare themselves and
were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in
Manti and have their temple work done and us
younger children sealed to them for eternity, the
very day before my eighteenth birthday - 27 May
1940. I know how happy they will be when all of
their children are sealed to them and we can be
together as a family in the world where they have
gone. They made many sacrifices for us and the
least we can do now for them is to prepare ourselves 
by righteous living to join them in the eternity."

Vera writes: - "Mother and Dad went through
the Manti Temple the day before Tresia's eighteenth
birthday and had the six younger children sealed to
them. Alta and I were too old at the time. Cousins
Byron and Mildred went through the temple with
them and then they all came over to Ephraim where
Ivan, I and our first son were living at the time and
I had dinner ready for them. Byron brought ice
cream for everyone for the occasion. Mildred said
she bet I'd never dreamed that I'd be cooking my
parents' wedding dinner someday!"
<span id="page-661"></span>

When World War II came along, their oldest
son George went into the service. He became a
gunner on a bomb squad flying missions over Germany.
On his tenth bombing mission his plane was
shot down over Germany and all the crew killed
except George, who was wounded and taken prisoner.
For seven months he was listed as "missing in
action" and his family had no idea whether he was
dead or alive. This must have been a real ordeal
for Vena and George and their family. But George
Jr., by the grace of a higher power, returned home
safe and well.

Vena's husband George passed away 12 Apr.
1951. They had been married going on thirty-four
years, nearly thirty years of which he had worked
in the mines. He had retired from the mines and
was trying his hand at herding sheep again when he
became ill and was brought home. Vera writes: - "The 
day Dad died he had the Elders in to administer 
to him. They promised him a good night's rest.
Later he sent mother out of the room to get him
something and when she returned he was dead."
George was buried beside little LaFay in the Goshen
cemetery. Vena received some compensation,
following his death, from the Industrial Commission 
because he died of "miners consumption".

Besides helping to raise her brothers' and
sisters' children and her own seven, Vena raised
a grandson, Terry, as long as she was able, since
his mother, Alta, had to work for a living away
from home. Left a widow, Vena continued to
spend much of her time in Santaquin but visited
around and stayed with her married children
occasionally, especially Tresia. She had enjoyed
comparatively good health throughout her life,
although at one time in her earlier years a doctor
said she had a breast cancer. Her family fasted
and prayed for her and the suspicious looking lump
disappeared. In middle age Vena became very
heavy. It was probably this extreme overweight
that caused the troubles and discouragement and
the painful arthritis in her head, neck and shoulders
that she suffered about the last year of her life.

When it came to the point that she needed a
lot of special care, it was impossible for her
<span id="page-662"></span>
children to do what was needed - though they did
all they could. She was placed in a rest home in
Payson for a short while but was unhappy there
because none of her children were near. So she
was moved to a rest home in Salt Lake City and
was only there a very short time when she passed
away, 5 July 1956, at sixty-nine years three months
and eight days. She had outlived her husband George 
a little over four years and two months.

Vena Christensen Clark's body rested in state
in a lovely casket in her home in Santaquin, surrounded 
by flowers. Hundreds of relatives and
friends came to view her and later to honor her at
a beautiful memorial service in the Ward chapel
there. She was laid to rest in the Goshen cemetery
8 July 1956 beside her dear husband and her small
daughter LaFay.

So after death they came to see "Aunt Vena",
relatives, nieces and nephews, as they had sought
her out in love in couples, groups or individually
as long as she lived and wherever she lived. She
had long been a favorite with them all. One of her
nieces, Elaine Christensen (Southwick) wrote a
tribute to her which will perhaps find an echo in
the hearts of all who knew and loved her, She
titles it, of course, "Aunt Vena": 

"Perhaps my remembered image of Aunt
Vena is like Stendhal's idea of "crystalization".
He claims that we do not see a person we really
love as she actually is but endow her with qualities
that she does not actually possess. 'In the salt
mines' he says, 'it is possible to leave a dead
branch - a black and ugly piece of wood - and to
find next morning when one returns that it has
become covered with salt crystals and is now a
glittering object which is a delight to behold.' So
maybe in my mind I have adorned Aunt Vena with
a whole 'array of glittering crystals' which she
may not have possessed - but this I doubt. Rather,
I may not have given her due credit for all she was
to me when she came to live with us after mother's
death.

"I remember very little of her before that
time and might have forgotten more had I not been
<span id="page-663"></span>
writing a journal while she was at our home. One
of the most outstanding things about Aunt Vena was
her chameleon ability to be any given age at any
required time. Although in years she numbered
almost thirty against my fourteen, we shared
secrets, activities and like heart pangs. Besides
providing me and my friends with homemade
bread, thick cream and sugar for an after school
snack, she also provided a sounding board and a
sympathetic understanding of my restless teenage 
fancies.

"As I look back through the eyes of experience, 
I can now know how tired she must have
been from all of our varied demands, how lonely
for love and attention from friends her own age,
and yet how patient, understanding and available
she was for our diversified family needs. I know
that she showed a great compassion for all of us
and that she was especially close to little Phillip
as she must have also been to mother. That
mother had adored her for her sweetness, gentleness 
and selflessness I have no doubt. She had
admired the glint of Aunt Vena's spun gold hair;
and in hopes that Virginia and I might possess a
like adornment, she had us brush our locks one
hundred strokes a day in the sunshine. Mother
had believed in the philosophy of the Great Stone
Face and had us try to emulate the benign and
guileless expression Aunt Vena had.

"Aunt Vena, bowing before the perplexity
of problems attendant to caring for five motherless 
children, often dreamed of mother, for she
told us so. She saw her in teaching situations of
all kinds, and yet she seemed always to nod
encouragement and approval at Aunt Vena who
stood humbly on this side of the veil, seeking
help. She did so want to please 'Jennie'. Aunt
Vena slept in the Blue Room with four-year-old
Phillip, who clung to her as a substitute for his
mother. One morning just at dawn she awoke to
see little Phil smiling and nodding at someone who
seemed to be leaving the room. Upon asking Phil
who the visitor was he replied, 'I've been talking
to my mama.' That Aunt Vena herself at times
lived close to the angels, I have never doubted.
<span id="page-664"></span>

"She was loved by all members of her family,
young and old alike, but because of her lack of 
subterfuge and her child-like qualities she was often
a butt for family pranks when she was a girl. She
used to entertain us children with stories of the
escapades she experienced with her brothers just
older, and other unusual happenings in her girlhood.
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when she told
about the time she had saved up extra eggs enough
to buy a coveted blouse. She told of carrying the
eggs in a basket and, accompanied by grandmother,
going carefully up the weed bordered sidewalk toward 
town. As they came to a wooden bridge, spanning 
an irrigation ditch, they stepped simultaneously 
upon a loose board. Aunt Vena, who weighed
less than grandmother, flew into the air and landed
on, in and under the ill-fated eggs.

"In appearance during her married years I
remember her as large, comfortable and expressive. 
Her eyes were light blue and readily showed
every expression she felt. Smile crinkles bordered
her eyes and smile wrinkles deepened the corners
of her mouth that sometimes pouted in mock severity.
She had a slight impediment in her speech (lisping,
I think) but it didn't stop the volubility of expressed
love and concern for all of her children and grandchildren 
and those of her 'dear brothers and sisters'. 
Her appelation for her family was always
prefixed by 'dear'. It was 'dear brother Albert or
dear brother Joseph, or Andrew, or Chris, or
Louis, or Arthur'. And it was 'dear sister Ada,
or Emma, or Elsie, or Tresia.' Her heart was
as big as her family and was the pivot around which
the family news circulated. She was an excellent
letter writer. She treasured the letters, cards,
pictures and clippings anyone sent her and she was
eager to pass on any family news she received.

"Although I saw very little of Aunt Vena during 
her last years, I do know that her children
honored and loved her and that everyone who knew
her spoke of her with endearing admiration. To
me she will always be a dear and cherished entity
crystalized into a glittering object endowed with
empathy, charity, trust, and a child-like faith in
life, humanity and God, which made her a delight
<span id="page-665"></span>
to know and a paragon to remember."

George Thomas Clark, husband of Elvena
Christensen, was born 6 June 1887 in Upton,
Summit, Utah. His parents were early Mormon
pioneers of Upton, from England, William Rolland
and Amelia Frances Smith Clark. He spent his
early boyhood in Upton and attended the public
schools that were available there. But it was
necessary for him to work hard, for Upton was
a frontier town and the people were mostly poor
and had to struggle for a living.

Upton, first called "Up From Town" because
of the altitude and distance from Coalville, which
was settled first, is still fourteen miles from
Coalville. The elevation is still the same, about
7,000 ft.; the winters are still long; only the name
has been shortened. Starvation, cold and disease
stared grimly at the first settlers there 105 years
ago. Deep snows softened the stark brush and
rock covered slopes but made foraging difficult
for farm and wild game animals. Clearing acreage
for planting had been difficult and the pioneers had
realized only a little barley, oats and a few potatoes
from a summer of hard labor. A few rabbits and
an occasional elk supplemented their meager diet,
and one family was forced to empty the straw from
their beds to keep the family cow alive through the
long dreary months.

Coalville was first settled in 1859 by a few
settlers who were attracted by the good farmland
at the confluence of Chalk Creek and the Weber
River. That same year coal was discovered along
Chalk Creek and more families flocked to this high
country. Isaac Burton and John Stanley followed
Chalk Creek still higher into the mountains and
cleared some land and built a pole fence around it.
In 1861 Joseph Huff came, saw the land and
exchanged a cow for it. That summer he harvested
a crop of wild hay and built a cabin. In early 1863
others began trickling in and soon more than 40
families called Upton home.

Slowly they cleared the land and brought
<span id="page-666"></span>
irrigation streams from nearby creeks. Oxen
and mules were used for plowing. In addition to
farming, some worked small coal mines, some
hauled logs to Park City, Salt Lake City and
Evanston, Wyoming. Much of this land is still in
the families of those Upton pioneers - Boyers,
Clarks, Saxtons, Meadows, Stayleys, Powells.
Most of them were converts to the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and some, including 
the Clarks, were from England. They recorded
baptisms in Chalk Creek through holes chopped in
the ice in winter months. They built a church, a
school and a fine amusement hall.

These Upton pioneers not only built their own
houses but they built their own furniture as well.
They whitewashed the walls of their log cabins with
lime and added board floors that were scrupulously
cleaned with homemade lye soap. They made their
own shoes and much of their clothing. They raised
gardens, raspberries and rhubarb. They trapped
beaver from nearby streams and lakes and they
even took time out to fight Indians, if that happened
to be necessary. They held community dances and
other celebrations and had their fun on homemade
sleds in winters.

There were lots of Clarks in Upton and all of
them were related to George. His grandmother
Clark came from England to Upton. His grandfather 
and grandmother Clark came and settled in
Upton. His father and mother were married in
Upton. Some of them had come there as early as
1869. His grandfather's brother, Frank Clark who
was an artist, painted murals on all four walls of
the large Upton recreation hall which people from
all around came there to see. Yes, George had
lots of relatives who had settled in Upton; for
besides his grandparents there were aunts and
uncles, great aunts and great uncles and cousins
by the dozens.

George's father and mother lived in Upton 
for some years and then moved into Wyoming for
another few years but returned again to live in
Upton. It was here that the majority of their ten
children were born. Tragedy struck the family in
1904 however, when George was nearing seventeen.

<span id="page-667"></span>
His mother gave birth to her tenth child on March
12th of that year but the little one died on the 14th
and the mother died on the 18th of the effects of
that childbirth. The next youngest child, age two,
passed away the end of that month, and as if this
weren't enough for the family to bear, the father
was rushed to Coalville with bloodpoisoning the
forepart of April and died there. There were less
than three weeks between the deaths of George's
parents, four of the family dying in less than a
month.

George was next to the oldest of the seven
remaining children, a third child of ten having
died in 1900. His daughter Vera writes: - "There
were seven children left in the family and they
were soon scattered among the various relatives
or anyone that would take them. Dad had no school
after that and was shifted around among two or
three different uncles at one time or another, as
they were able to use him in farming or with the
sheep. He eventually ended up herding sheep for
the Bennion Livestock Company and it was through
the manager of that company, Chris "I" Christensen, 
that he met his future wife, Elvena."

George was two months and ten days younger
than Elvena. Vera tells that during April and May
of each year her father used to tease her mother
about being the "oldest" in the family, saying he
was sure glad that he wasn't as old as she or that
he'd surely hate to be the oldest, or some such.
But nearly thirty-four happily married years
came out of that marriage and eight lovely children, 
seven of whom grew to maturity, married and
had children of their own. They have a good sized
posterity today.

George was rather small of stature, slightly
shorter than Elvena. But he was tall in the things
that mattered most - honesty, industry, charity,
goodwill - there is not room here to name all of
his good qualities. He was a kind and loving
husband and a good father. He was not able to
provide his family with many luxuries but their
home was one of peace, understanding and love.
He had many talents even though he had had little
training and few opportunities. He loved music
<span id="page-668"></span>
and used to play for dances in Upton and that area
before he was married. They say he played the
banjo well, was excellent on the harmonica, could
chord on the organ and piano, and could sure play
the mandolin like a professional. Though he had
never had a music lesson in his life he could play
any piece of music that the dance band played.

George worked in the mines in Juab County
for almost thirty years. In fact, he worked there
until the mines closed down about 1950. At a
large celebration held in Payson, honoring men of
long and outstanding service to mining at that
time, George was presented with a pin for his fine
contribution. But he worked in the mines too long
as far as his health was concerned. Breathing the
poor air and dust in the mines so long brought on
silicosis which caused his death, 12 Apr. 1951, at
age sixty-four years ten months and six days.

George was buried 16 Apr. 1951 in the Goshen
cemetery. Two weeks later, upon the advice of
and after serious consultation with his doctor, a
lawyer, and his mother who was hard to convince,
his son George arranged to have his father's body
exhumed and an autopsy performed to prove the
nature of the condition that caused his death.
From the report of those who examined him it was
possible to file a claim with the Industrial Commission 
which eventually paid his mother a lump
sum plus small monthly payments thereafter,
which helped her so much at that time. But an
unusual thing happened during the time the body
was being examined. Some of George senior's
own relatives, who had been unable to attend his
funeral, came to the Goshen cemetery to visit his
grave and found nothing but a gaping hole beside
his marker. They immediately called on Vena and
made things very difficult for her at the time.

## FOSTER CHILDREN

<span id="page-669"></span>
(10) FOSTER CHILDREN

(A) Ada Lorena Madsen, daughter of Victor
August Hastrup Madsen, adopted son of Bishop
Christian August Madsen of Gunnison and his wife
Sarah Olesen, was born in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah 14 Mar. 1888. Ada was the fifth child and
fourth daughter born to this couple. Else K.
Christensen was the midwife who assisted with her
birth and also cared for her and her mother during
the time of the mother's illness which followed.
Ada was born with a malfunctioning heart and was
very frail herself, needing special care.

Knowing that she could not live long, twenty-seven
year old Sarah Madsen exacted a promise
from Else K. Christensen that she would take her
baby daughter after she passed away and raise her
as her own. Else promised. Sarah Madsen died
25 May 1888 and was buried in the Gunnison cemetery 
a few days later beside a baby daughter,
Almira, who had passed away some six years
before at two years of age.

Sarah Madsen died on Friday and her baby
daughter hadn't been given a name yet. But she
was blessed and given the name Ada Lorena Madsen
the day after her mother's death, Sat. 26 May 1888,
in the home and Else K. Christensen took the little
two month twelve day old invalid to her home to
raise as her own, as promised. Though the father,
Victor A. Madsen, would not consent to Laurs and
Else adopting his daughter, she having been sealed
to him and his wife in the Covenant, yet he consented
to them calling her by the surname of Christensen
as long as she was with them and gave them a signed
statement to that effect.

Much of the rest of Ada's story has been told
in earlier pages of this book - the love she was
given and the sunshine she brought into the Christensen
home - her trip to Denmark at two-and-a-half 
years of age with her foster mother - her
untimely death within two months and a few days
of her ninth birthday, 3 Jan. 1897. She was baptized 
a member of the LDS Church 21 July 1896.

A little more than ten years following her death,
<span id="page-670"></span>
Laurs and Else had her endowments taken care of
in the Manti Temple, 22 Feb. 1907.

Ada was buried on the Madsen plot beside her
mother in the Gunnison cemetery. Her tombstone
bears the following inscription: - "In loving memory
of Ada Lorena, daughter of Victor A. and Sarah
Madsen - Born 14 Mar. 1888 - Died 3 Jan. 1897 - In
sore distress your life has past - You loved us
all while life did last - Reared by Laurs M. C. and
Else K. Christensen". Less than eleven months
after Ada's death her natural father, forty-two year
old Victor August Madsen, joined the others of the
little group resting there on the Madsen plot in
Gunnison cemetery. He died 16 Nov. 1897 and was
survived by his second wife and a son and two daughters
by his first wife.

(B) Anna Theresa Carlson, daughter of Carl
Gustaf Carlson and Hulda Charlotte (or Caroline)
Karlsdotter or Karlson, was born 9 Feb. 1889 in
Fjarstad, &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland, Sweden. She was christened
(d&oslash;bt) in the Swedish church there, 24 Feb.
1889. She was called by her second name, the
spelling of which was eventually shortened to
Tresia.

When Tresia was going on four years old her
father took his own life. Her mother, left without
means of support, was forced to return to the
home of her aged father to live taking Tresia with
her. Soon another little girl was born to the young
widow and Tresia had a baby sister, Edith. The
old grandfather, however, made things altogether
miserable for the three of them, but especially
Tresia's young mother, complaining over every
crust of bread that went into the mouths of her
little ones.

Tresia's mother was contacted by Mormon
missionaries and soon joined the LDS Church, 5
Apr. 1894, becoming a member of the Link&ouml;ping
Branch there in Sweden. At this her father became
even more concerned with the "extra little mouths
to feed" and the unhappy mother knew hardly what
to do or where to turn.

<span id="page-671"></span>

Long before, Tresia's father's father had
passed away when her father was very young and
his mother married a Mr. Newren, said to have
been a musician, and by him she had at least two
sons, Tresia's father's half brothers. Family
tradition claims that Mr. Newren was accidently
drowned when crossing a stream late one evening
while returning from a dance at which he had been
the fiddler. Be that as it may, Tresia's grandmother,
the widow Newren, joined the LDS Church
and, together with her two sons, emigrated to
America and Zion. Later she died in Utah and
Tresia's mother received a small sum of money
from the grandmother's estate, as her husband's
portion in behalf of his children.

At this time Tresia's mother, encouraged
by the Mormon missionaries, was herself planning
to emigrate to Zion as soon as she could get the
means. She decided to use the children's small
legacy to send her oldest daughter, Tresia, to stay
with one of her husband's half brothers in Utah until
she and the younger daughter could join her. So
Tresia left Sweden by ship, in company with a
returning Mormon missionary and his Swedish
bride, the autumn of 1895, enroute to Zion and
her half-uncle Mr. Newren's home in Salt Lake
City. Little Swedish Tresia was going on seven
at the time and could speak no English. Mr. Newren
was a polygamist with two wives and two
separate families. Times were hard and money
was scarce and with many mouths to feed, Tresia
was not overly welcome. She stayed with Mr.
Newren's one family in Salt Lake for awhile and
then was sent to Scofield in Carbon County to live
with his other wife and family, where she remained
for about a year. In the meantime the first wife
and family had moved to Gunnison, Sanpete County
and Tresia was sent to live with them again. Then
these Newrens left Gunnison and she ended up living
with an elderly couple in Centerfield who were no
relation as far as she knew and whose names she
soon forgot.

Tresia was baptized a member of the LDS
Church 31 July 1897, while living in Centerfield,
She had never attended school up to this point so
<span id="page-672"></span>
was sent to school in Centerfield when it opened in
the fall. She went to school taking a sandwich of
dried bread spread with bacon grease for her lunch.
She remembers being hungry most of the time.
School in Centerfield was short lived for Tresia
however, for after a few days of it she wandered
away several miles into north Gunnison and became
lost - and nobody came to find her.

She spent that night sleeping on the steps of
the Relief Society hall in northwest Gunnison. We
have learned previously in this book how she ended
up next day at the home of Laurs and Else K.
Christensen and how they decided to give her a
home, saying, "One more mouth won't make any
difference." Tresia writes: - "After I had been
shifted around from one family to another for two
years, the Christensens took me in. It reads like
a book. They were so wonderful to me. There
are no words written or spoken that are good
enough to describe them. They treated me as
their own - God bless them! The rest of the
Christensen family was grand to me also."

Tresia took the surname of Christensen while
she lived with Laurs and Else and their family.
She started school in the first grade in Gunnison
when she was going on nine and atteded there
through the seventh grade. She left and went to
Salt Lake City to work just before she turned
sixteen, so she lived with the Christensens for
somewhat more than six years. She always kept
in touch with them, however, and deemed them
"her family", returning to visit them on occasions
as long as any of them lived. Even today she keeps
in touch with their children, for she is still living
at age eighty in Maricopa, California (1969).

Tresia worked at various things in Salt Lake
City. She was a nursemaid for awhile and then did
housework. She worked in different cafes and had
a good job in a store at one time. After some six
years of working around like this she met and
married a man by the name of William H. Scott.
They were married in Salt Lake City, 11 June 1911,
when she was twenty-two. Mr. Scott owned a drugstore
in Blackfoot, Idaho and took Tresia there to
live. But William drank and the couple's marriage
<span id="page-673"></span>
ended in divorce in December of that same year.

Following her divorce Tresia went from
Idaho to Oakland, California and worked there for
nearly two years. Then she moved to Dillon,
Montana to work. Here she met a bachelor ten
years older than she, by the name of James Lacy.
The two went to Evanston, Wyoming to be married,
3 July 1917. Tresia called her new husband Jim
and he was lacking five months of being thirty-eight
when they were wed and she was five months past
twenty-eight. They lived in Dillon, Montana for
five more years where Jim worked for a lumber
company and an ice company. They then went to
Delano, California for a year and a half, where he
worked as a mason. Taft, California became their
home next for about a year and a half and here Jim
worked building schools and as a steam fitter. The
oil fields in Maricopa nearby furnished him with
his next employment and here they lived and worked
for the next seventeen years. Jim then worked in
the oil fields at Taft for three and a half years, but
they continued to live at Maricopa. It was in Maricopa
that Jim died of a heart attack, 4 Feb. 1946,
and thus ended more than twenty-eight and a half
years of a very happy marriage. Tresia wrote: - "Jim
Lacy was a wonderful man and he was grand to me."

Tresia continued to live on in Maricopa and
here she became acquainted with a widower by the
name of Ray H. Moore. On 4 May 1951 the two
went to Las Vegas, Nevada and were married.
Tresia writes: - "Ray Moore was also a very
good man and kind to me. We had been married
just a little over two years when he died of a heart
attack, 30 May 1953. He had three children by his
first wife and through them I now claim nine grandchildren
and eight great-grandchildren who are
also very kind to me."

Tresia, very pretty as a girl and a beautiful
woman even at eighty years of age (1969), never
had any children of her own. But she is surrounded
by those who love her for she is gracious, friendly,
outgoing and greatly admired. She still lives in
Maricopa, California, keeping her own apartment
but sharing cooking responsibilities with a lady
<span id="page-674"></span>
friend next door, with whom she says she "has a
ball". Though her eyes are rather poor now and
she is forced to use a cane some, yet she gets
around among her friends and enjoys life.

For a number of years after Ray Moore's
death she made a yearly trip to Salt Lake City
each autumn by bus and stayed with her cousin
Della Newren Rudy in Salt Lake City for several
weeks. At these times she visited around in Salt
Lake and Provo with the descendants of Laurs and
Else K. Christensen, to the fourth generation. She
attended several Christensen family reunions. She
is the only person now living that ever dwelt intimately
with Laurs and Else and their family. She
has added so many "memories" to the pages of
this book.

Perhaps the happiest event in Tresia's later
years took place 12 Oct. 1965, when she went to
the Salt Lake Temple for her own endowments and
was sealed to her second husband, James Lacy, for
all eternity. She is now waiting hopefully for the
opportunity to go again to the temple and be sealed
to her own father and mother, together with her
deceased sister Edith. Their temple ordinances
are now being taken care of in preparation for this
holy work. May she be thus blessed! Someday she
will meet again with those she once knew and loved,
as we shall meet our loved ones, on the other side
of the veil.

# THEIR NUMEROUS GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR DESCENDANTS
<span id="page-675"></span>

> We have come by way of the trials and
errors, the anxieties, hopes, pathos, and
strivings of others - We have been given so
much for which we have paid so little.

> --Richard L. Evans

Laurs M. C. and Else K, Christensen had
sixty-seven grandchildren. A history of each is
included in this part of the book. Fifty-one of
them were living when the writing of it was begun;
four have passed away since. In order to save
space and repetition each grandchild's name in
the beginning will be followed by a number denoting
the branch of the family to which he or she belongs;
viz: Christian's (1), Andrew's (2), Joseph's (3),
etc. Each is listed chronologically, according to
the year of birth. Granddaughters appear under
their maiden names, and in all instances the
original Danish spelling of the surname Christen-
sen has been used, although a number may now
Spell the name Christenson. It is too confusing
to do otherwise. ey

How fortunate we are to be able to present
some of the experiences of these people as told by
themselves; for most of those living sent in their
own histories which ranged in length from very-
short to far-too-lengthy to be published in full here.
We are most grateful for each and everyone, how-
ever, and delighted to find that our Christensen
cousins have about run the gamut of interests and
accomplishments in this great panorama of modern

American living.

## Pearl Eva Christensen
<span id="page-676"></span>

(1) Pearl Eva Christensen (1) writes of herself:-- 
"I was born 7 Oct. 1894 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah.
I have blue-green eyes and blond hair.
People say I have a pleasant but quiet personality.
I was baptized a member of the LDS church 21 Oct.
1902 in the Manti Temple by Brother Christian
Anderson and confirmed the same day and place by
John B. Maiben. Grandmother Christensen took
me there along with two of my cousins, Harold
Christensen and Leo Nelson.

"My first day of school I went hand in hand
with my friend Erma Lundberg. My first teacher
was Amber Bardsley. I remember Grandma Christensen's
chicken soup and dumplings, also her jelly-roll
cake which she made each Sunday for the school
teachers who boarded with her. She was a generous
person who often invited friends and relatives to
her house to eat. I remember Grandpa Christensen
Singing Danish songs and telling stories as we children
walked with him as he drove his cows home from
the west pasture. I remember going to Christenburg
when I was young to visit my other grandparents,
Ole and Inger Larsen, One time while crossing the
swift Sanpitch River near their place in a wagon, we
barely made it across. Also, when I was a girl, I
used to often go with my father on short business
trips here and there. He was so much fun and such
a wonderful father to me. He used to call me his
fat little Danish girl because I was plump and had
long hair in braids.

"I was Primary organist for one year in the
Gunnison Ward at age twelve and was an attendant
to the queen, Miss Ella Bywater, at the Pioneer
Day celebration there in 1906. If I turned up missing,
mother could usually find me somewhere
dressing old ladies' hair or assisting the old ladies
in our neighborhood, for that is what took my fancy
at that age.

"In the spring of 1910 sickness came to our
home and I lost two younger sisters, Elora and
Orilla, of scarlet fever within five days of each
other. I can still remember how beautiful they
looked in their coffins but how grief-stricken we
all were. That same summer father bought a lovely
<span id="page-677"></span>
brick house from his brother Andrew at 3020 South
9th East in Salt Lake City and we moved there.
We were in the Forest Dale Ward where I took
part in Sunday School and M.I.A. and later taught
in Primary for two years with Ella Seegmiller.

"I had finished fifth grade before we moved
and I attended school in Salt Lake City at the
Roosevelt school on 9th East and 33rd South from
where I graduated from eighth grade. Then I
attended the LDS High School. It was during this
time that I had the wonderful experience of singing
inthe Tabernacle Choir for about three years. I
studied under Evan Stephens. This was one of the
choicest experiences of my girlhood!

"At age twenty-one I took up a homestead
beside my father's ranch on The Oasis near Lyman,
Wyoming. Father had a four room house built, two
rooms on his side of the land and two rooms on my
side. I lived on the ranch in summers and in Lyman
in the winters. It was while living in Lyman
that I was called to be a visiting teacher in the
Relief Society for the first time.

"Father at this time was manager and a
large stockholder of the Bennion Livestock Company.
A man by the name of Peter A. Jensen was
also a stockholder and foreman in the same com-
pany. It was on The Oasis that our crops were
burned and that father's untimely death occurred.
Nothing can ever blot out the intense feeling of
grief and despair that came over me that October
1917. I gave up the homestead and moved back to
Salt Lake City sometime after that and had a comforting
patriarchal blessing from Hyrum G, Smith.

"After father's death Peter A. Jensen became
manager of the Bennion Livestock Company. He
was a very kind and gentle man and came often to
visit us. He had soft red curly hair, big blue eyes,
was a classy dresser and an excellent dancing
partner. He and I fell in love and were married
14 July 1920 in Farmington, Utah. I was always
his 'darling'. (Peter August Jensen was born 27
Mar, 1884 in Gunnison, Utah, the son of Michael
and Anna Lena Peterson Jensen), We spent our
honeymoon on the Weber Ranch, After two years
<span id="page-678"></span>
wwe moved to Eureka, Nevada, where Peter ran the
air compressor for the Uncle Sam's Mine. After
a year we moved to Goshen, Utah where he worked
as a special timberman in the Tintic Standard mine,
then moved over to Eureka, Utah, working for the
same company. He then went back to work for the
Howells and Sharp Livestock Co., which had bought
out the Bennion Livestock Co., and worked for
them until his death.

"When we were first married we purchased
a brick home at 363 East 21st South in Salt Lake
City and rented it out for ten years. Finally we
moved into this home of ours after losing a darling
little son who was stillborn. Then our first daughter,
Dartear Pearline, was born and then we lost
another little son who was also stillborn. Our last
child, Arminta Caroline, soon came along to cheer
our hearts. Both girls had beautiful blond curly
hair and were blessed with musical voices. Dartear
sang solos when she was very young in Ward and
school functions and also on the radio, Arminta
also sang in such affairs and did solo work in
"Showboat" and "Promised Valley". In the meantime
I taught in Primary and among other things
was able to bring two little boys into activity in
the church. They had been neglected and Peter
had great influence with them. We kept in touch
with them over the years. One of these boys went
on a mission when eighteen years of age, the other
died in the service fighting for his country.

"When Dartear was married her husband went
directly into the service at Camp Campbell, Kentucky.
When her first baby was born I went to live with
them in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. I only stayed
there a few weeks and then went to Nashville,
Tennessee with Mrs. Barbee, a relative of Reed
Smoot's. Later, when Dartear's husband was
transferred to Camp Cook near Santa Maria,
California, while they went ahead by automobile to
get settled I tended their baby, Dawn Lynn, and
later took her by train to join them. I had a fine
trip seeing all the sights, gathering shells near
the ocean and enjoying the huge palm trees that I
had never seen before,

"When Arminta was married she and her
<span id="page-679"></span>
husband moved to Fairbanks, Alaska. When their
first child was born there I went to visit them.
The trip took thirteen hours of flying time. I
stayed three months that summer. The first LDS
chapel dedicated in Fairbanks was where baby
David was blessed. While there I saw the great
Northern Lights, the Midnight Sun, and attended
their one hundred year centennial celebration. I
saw large white Alaskan wolf dogs with light blue
eyes and sled dogs in darker shades. I saw the
gold dredge in operation and also the big fish
wheel. I saw the perma frost which looked like
a big layer cake with different shades of icing in
between. I had a ride in an army jet at one of the
largest military camps in the north. Flying back
from Alaska we had difficulty with one engine and
they gave us Mae West wings to put on twice. We
were afraid we wouldn't make it. We stopped at
Yakima, Washington for repairs.

"On 29 Nov. 1958 in Salt Lake City my
'darling' died suddenly. I was stricken with grief.
Afterwards, the girls thought it would do me good
to take a trip. So I attended the Hill Cumorah
pageant and other places of early church interest.
I attended a meeting at the Sacred Grove where it
poured rain all around but not a drop touched us.
Returning to Salt Lake City I later went to the
temple there and had Peter and myself sealed
together as man and wife for eternity, 26 June
1959. I was also sealed to my parents there that
same day. Then I went on a temple tour of Manti,
St. George, Mesa and Los Angeles temples and
enjoyed the trip so very much.

"After coming home I went to work as a
practical nurse, working with tiny babies and
small children. Sometimes I cared for elderly
women in their homes or acted as a companion
on their travels. I joined the D.U.P. and served
as a teacher in our camp for the year 1960. In
1959 I was put in as work director in the Wells
Ward Relief Society. I took two courses in genealogy
and am still working at that, I-now go often
to the Salt Lake Temple to do work for the dead.
I am in very good health and still going strong as
I approach my seventy-fifth birthday (1969)."

## Joseph Harold Christensen 
<span id="page-681"></span>

(2) Joseph Harold Christensen (3) "I was born Sun. 21 Oct. 1894 in the Bardsley home in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, where father had rented two rooms. He was a schoolteacher. When I was about five years old we moved to Redmond, Utah where my father and mother both taught school. I can remember trying to keep up with the older boys there playing 'Follow Jack' and trying to jump a wide ditch as they did. I would get wet and then would get my legs whipped with my wet stockings that had buttons on the top, and that didn't feel so good.

"The next two winters father taught at Vernal, Utah so we moved there. I missed the first two grades of school, as mother taught me at home while in Vernal. Then we moved back to Gunnison and I attended school there until I was twelve. At that time they felt that I was too young to go away to school so I took the eighth grade over since there was no high school in Gunnison at that time. The following year I went to Ephraim, Utah and attended Snow College, living with some people by the name of Nielson.

"My first trip to Salt Lake City came about this time the summer I was thirteen or fourteen, Alma Fredrickson, a boy who lived with us for nine years and was just like a brother, and I decided to see the big city. I don't remember how we got there or who we went with but I do remember we both had new straw hats and we wanted to see the trains. We got up on the viaduct to look down on the trains as they passed below and our hats blew off and we lost them and besides got peppered with hot cinders.

"About 1910 father fed between twenty and thirty milk cows down on his brother Albert's Gunnison ranch about a mile or two west of town. I had to go down there both before and after school for a time to help milk them. I was pretty happy when he sold the carload to the Clover Leaf Dairy and I got rid of that job.

"The year after attending Snow College at Ephraim, which was just a preparatory school, I attended first year High School in Manti and lived <span id="page-682"></span>with Grandpa and Grandma Christensen a few blocks north and east of the schoolhouse. That is when I first met a girl named Herma Keller. The year after that, since a two-year High School had just been started in Gunnison, I went back home for my second year of High School training. I was Gunnison High School's first studentbody president that year. The following two years I finished high school at Manti. I was on the basketball team both of those years - captain of the team - center - and star player. We went to Provo for the finals the second year. I was also studentbody president of Manti High that second year (1914-15).

"I dated Herma Keller - we were in school together. She was very active in school plays, etc., and we both belonged to the Dramatic Club of 1915. We were married the next year, 28 Dec. 1916, in the Manti Temple. There were eight years between my only living sister, Ruth Ellen, and I, mother having lost three babies between us. I had three younger brothers at the time I was married - Myron, Virgil and Marvin. Another brother, Don, was born just four days after my marriage. Mother attended our wedding celebration at the Keller home the night of our marriage and I didn't even know she was expecting. I knew little about the 'bees and the birds' at that time.

"After Herma and I were married we lived in Gunnison until our first baby, Cloyd, was six months old (Jan. 1918) and then we moved to the farm east of Gunnison into the house Dad had built there earlier for some farm workers. Previously I had worked with Dad on this farm in summers and during school when I had time, but now I took it over myself. I raised sugar beets, sheep and cattle. I was also busy in church activities, teaching in the M.I.A. and later acting as second counselor.

"Herma and I had four children, three boys and a girl. When Dorothy, our youngest, was ten years old (1935) we moved back to town so the children would be closer to school and church. We rented a Sorensen home in the northwest part of Gunnison. We then built a lovely new brick home of our own in northeast Gunnison, but we were only <span id="page-683"></span>in it a short time when Herma passed away, 12 May 1940. I was single for two years and then I married a widow, Stella Sorenson Averett. We met in Salina and were married in Richfield 25 May 1942. She also had several children but she was wonderful to me and mine.

"I was on the Gunnison City Council fourteen years, board member of the Gunnison Irrigation Company eight years, treasurer of the City Canal Company for six years and Watermaster for many years also. More recently I was on the government appointed commission to buy farms in Sanpete County for nonmarginal farmers. I served in this capacity for six years."

Harold's daughter Dorothy passed away following an automobile accident, 29 Aug. 1963. His second wife, Stella, died rather suddenly 19 Nov. 1967. Harold became rather discouraged after that and his heart condition of long standing seemed to get worse. He visited his sister Ruth Ellen Hansen in California for some weeks around Christmas. He returned home to the farmhouse where he and Stella had lived for several years, the farm itself now being owned by his son Keller who had built it into one of the finest cattle farms in the area. Keller and sometimes Cloyd came to have breakfast with him every morning. They found him still in bed Monday morning, 11 Mar. 1968. He had passed away in his sleep during the early hours. He was buried 14 Mar. 1968 in the Gunnison cemetery beside his wife Herma.

## Giles Elmer Christensen 

(7) Giles Elmer Christensen (1) born 4 July 1899 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Elmer writes: "I was christened Giles Elmer but later changed to Elmer Giles. When I was a boy father wasn't home much. I remember while we were living in Gunnison Father came home one spring after having been on the desert all winter with the sheep. His whiskers were long and red and I didn't know who he was. So when he came over and kissed mother I was shocked. He left and I told mother I was going to tell Father that she let that man with the red whiskers kiss her. Later Father came back from the barber shop with the red whiskers gone and of course I recognized him then and told him about the man with the red whiskers kissing mother. Father sure got a kick out of that.

"I started school in Gunnison and then when we moved to Salt Lake City (1910) I finished the fourth grade at the Roosevelt school on 33rd South 9th East in Salt Lake, and that was the end of school for me. I ran away from home and went to California. But I didn't stay away very long and soon went back to Utah and father put me to work at various things on the ranch or herding sheep. But he wasn't with me very much when I was on the ranch or herding sheep either.

"Roy and I used to take turns working on the ranch in Wyoming called 'The Oasis', Roy was there the fall of 1917 and I was working on the dry <span id="page-687"></span>farm in Cedar Valley. One night in early October I dreamed, or imagined I saw Father standing in the door of my tent. Though he said nothing I knew something was wrong. The next day they brought me word of the accident that caused his death. I was eighteen at the time. After his death I continued to work for the Bennion Livestock Company herding sheep for awhile and then I went into the army. After the war was over I went to work in the mines, first at Ruth and then at Ely, Nevada.

"It was in Ely, Nevada in 1929 that I married the widow Frances, or 'Fannie' Tanfield Marsh. She had three children by her first husband, Jack, Don and Mary Marsh. I didn't adopt them. Fannie died in 1932 so I left Ely and went to work in the mines in Colorado at Alma, Fair Play and Leadville mines. From there I went to California. Then I joined the army again and was in it from October 1942 until February 1944. I was stationed on the island of Honolulu in Hawaii. I was cook there for about a year so I was made a Sergeant.

"I then came back to California, I drove truck here in Los Angeles for E. Willardson Plumbing Company for twenty-six years and then, after they went broke, I went to work for F.C. Schilling Plumbing Co. and worked for them for three years. I remarried here a widow by the name of Mrs. Norah Kathleen Makerove. She doesn't like the name of Norah so we call her 'Kay'. She had a five year old son, Ronald Makerove, whom I raised as my own for eighteen years, although I never adopted him.

"My life isn't very exciting now for a few years back they sent me to the hospital with heart trouble. (He also has emphysema). Now they won't let me work so I have retired and just putter around with the flowers here on the place and am getting fat and lazy. In the First World War I was known as Giles Elmer and in the Second World War as Elmer Giles. Now I hardly ever hear either of these names as everyone down here calls me Chris."

Elmer is the only one of the Christensen descendants to have served in both great world wars. He has no children of his own. He is now <span id="page-688"></span>living in Los Angeles (1969) with his second wife, Kay, and enjoying life as he approaches his seventieth birthday, in spite of his ailments and limited activity. They say he raises the most beautiful flowers!

## LaFaun Christensen

(8) LaFaun Christensen (3) was born 27 Feb.
1900 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, and died 13 May
1900 also in Gunnison and was buried there. Some
family records claim she was born and died in 1901.

## Edith Lovena Christensen

(9) Edith Lovena Christensen (2) later changed the spelling of her first name to Edythe. Her own history, entitled "As Memory Serves", is a beautiful one and was written for her descendants. We have only room for a few highlights: - "I was born 22 Apr. 1900 in Ann Arbor, Washtenau, Michigan, where Father was attending school. I have been told that I was plump and good natured as a baby, with brown eyes and blonde hair. Later my hair turned to deep brown with copper glints.

"My own earliest recollections date back to age four and a half, when mother and us children were living in Provo, Utah, while father was in Europe for further study. Adelbert and I had diphtheria. I was given the antitoxin in time to bring about my recovery - he was not and died. Young as I was I felt sobered and bereft. I had loved this older brother with all the tenacity of my little soul.

"We moved to Salt Lake City in 1905 and in late 1906 or early 1907 father purchased a lovely home on 27th South and 9th East. On the extensive grounds father had a fishpond constructed and stocked with trout. In all family activities we children never felt left out or in want of the things that meant most - attention - pride in achievement - love in abundance. I was permitted a year of kindergarten at age six at the LDS School. I went back and forth by streetcar with Father, who was principal of the school. Regular school started for me at the Roosevelt grade school, judged to be about a mile from our home, which distance I walked in 
<span id="page-689"></span>
snow or shine. I was eager to learn and soaked up the lessons like a sponge. The winter of 1909/10 I passed off the second and third grades in one year.

"It was in our fishpond that spring of 1910 that our baby sister Elsie was drowned. My brothers and I had been commissioned to 'watch out for her' but were jumping the rope and forgot. I still blame myself for that tragedy. I never jumped the rope again! Later that spring we sold our cherished home to our wonderful Uncle Chris "I" and in July father, mother, Wendell age 7, Sheldon age 4, and I age 10, left for Europe.

"After two wonderful months in England, where father studied and 'put himself out' to give us numerous cultural and educational experiences, we sailed to Denmark to meet our beloved Christensen grandparents and with them visit Danish relatives there. Then all were bidden a fond adieu and father headed us towards Germany and school again. He continued to take time to show us spots of cultural and historical interest and inspire us with his stories of the same. We even visited the Berlin Palace and a parade of the Kaiser's goose-stepping troups.

"Leipzig was our destination and here father studied at the University. We shared the apartment of some German saints. Wendell and I attended the early grades. Among other things we learned to speak German quite well. I also started lessons on the piano. My teacher was Fraulein Hedwig Hartel, a convert to the church. At the conclusion of each lesson I was given a treat - usually a small molded pudding of blancmange with a raspberry syrup, which was lucious.

"Christmas in Germany, long the toy center of the world, was almost beyond description. Lucky children, we were taken into exciting shops and throngs. Our eyes beheld things beyond anything we had yet imagined. The main event of spring that year (1911) was the arrival of my fourth brother, Luther. He was a beauty!

"Returning to Provo that fall, Father was given a full professorship at BYU. I enrolled in fifth grade at BY Training School and attended
<span id="page-690"></span>
there three years, through seventh grade. In those three years we lived in three different areas in the Provo and Pleasant View areas. Why we moved so much I'll never know. Mother always left a place looking better than she found it, which took a lot of work. We all helped. It was in Pleasant View the spring of 1914 that my sister Lucile was born.

"I never did attend eighth grade, for that fall found us in Rexburg, Idaho, where Father had been sent by the church to head the Ricks Academy. I started as a freshman in high school that year and made an "A" average for the next three years. I
was fond of music and was chosen as a member of a ladies double trio in school, which performed often. During my second summer I took a six weeks course in piano - my first since Leipzig.

"Discipline was strict in our home. Rules were laid down quietly but firmly. I was informed early that I might start dating following my seventeenth birthday. The day finally arrived and I accepted a date from a fine young man to attend a school dance. Father stipulated a rather early time to return. Via our homeward journey we stopped at a drugstore for refreshments. Oh my! We discovered that even by walking fast we would still be a half hour late. Father met us at the door. He said little and that in a quiet voice of steel. The young man left and never braved another date with me. Underneath my disappointment I knew I had broken a promise and deserved punishment, yet deeper still I felt protected. My father loved me enough to keep the fortress tight!

"The spring of 1917 found us living in the small village of LaVerkin in southern Utah's Dixie. I had developed some anemia and Father, eager to get out from under the pressures of school work, had used this as a partial excuse to resign his position in Rexburg, to mother's dismay. A four-roomed log hut overlooking the murky Virgin River was our home for awhile. It was pretty desolate. Lizards scuttled over the sandy soil, sometimes invading our very rooms. But between the bright hot summer sun and dippings in the mineral springs there, I recovered my health. We moved into a brick home in the fall and the three boys 
<span id="page-691"></span>
went to school but I stayed out and helped at home, gave piano lessons, which bolstered my confidence and also my finances, worked in Sunday School and M.I.A. and served as drama and music director for the young people of the community.

"Father received another church call the spring of 1918, this time to preside over the Millard Academy at Hinckley, Utah, so we moved again. The Academy was small and rundown but father was a good organizer and a hard worker. With his advice and help I started as a teacher of music at the Academy and also taught a class of theology, Book of Mormon, besides taking a few classes. I did soprano solo work for school and church, became the Ward organist and organized and played piano for a four-piece orchestra. There was the usual whirl of dances, parties, picnics, etc., and being a 'new girl' I walked off with the prize in escorts in Hinckley, as I had in LaVerkin.

"Margaret, the folks' last child, was born there in May 1919. That spring Father gave up school work for good and turned his attention to others of his projects. He purchased the big Star Ranch north of Nephi, Utah, together with his brother Albert and brother-in-law Otis Ercanback. So we moved to Star Ranch and had a busy and beautiful summer.

"Father rented a home in Provo and moved us there for school that winter. I entered as a freshman at B.Y.U. I studied voice with Florence Jeppersen (Madsen) among other subjects, and renewed my acquaintance with friends I had known earlier at the Training School, especially Grace Nixon. At the close of school the spring of 1920 the family moved back to Star Ranch but I stayed on for twelve weeks of summer school. That fall the folks moved back to Provo for school and I enrolled for my second year at B.Y.U.

"One day about March of 1921 my friend Grace asked me suddenly, 'How would you like to go to Boston with me to study next fall?' Would I indeed! I could hardly wait to ask my parents. My practical mother was not enthused but my 
<span id="page-692"></span>
dreamer-of-a-father was elated and thought he could see me through. Grace was graduating that spring while I had had only two winters and one summer of college.

"The day of departure arrived but the money father expected did not. However, he had arranged for me a loan of $300.00 through the church school system. This would barely pay my fare, my tuition at the Leland Powers School of Dramatic Art and my first month's rent, with a little left over. Florence Jepperson had written ahead and engaged us room and board with a couple she knew in Boston. When we arrived there were about three weeks left before school started. I immediately found a job as waitress in a downtown cafe. The place was busy and the trays were heavy. I stayed on but looked for something better.

"I know it was through prayer that I ran across the exclusive little French Pastry Shop owned and managed by Mr. Constantin, a Greek and a gentleman in every sense of the word. I was hired as waitress on the spot. The wage was good and soon I was promoted to cashier with a raise in salary. My hours were from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, and since school hours were from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. this was perfect. The subway opened within a few steps of the shop and the exit was near my apartment.

"Grace didn't have to work but she had to be careful. She got a monthly check from home, but I got none. I had to make my own way. With insufficient money for board I asked our landlady for permission to fix my own meals. Breakfast consisted of hot chocolate made with canned milk and water, and a peanut butter or honey sandwich. Lunch consisted of a large 5&cent; apple or, if I was extra hungry, a 10%cent; plate of spaghetti purchased on my way from school. My night meal, included with my job, was soup or salad, a sandwich, certain pastries or ice cream. And thus I managed.

"I decided to change from drama to my first love, music, the next fall and planned to enter the New England Conservatory of Music. Funds would not allow for a trip home that summer so I accepted 
<span id="page-693"></span>
a summer job with still more money from my employer, Mr, Constantin, which was to introduce his French candies in connection with a linen shop in the seaside resort town of Magnolia, Maine. I lodged at the home of the charming Jewish woman who tended the Linen Shop. I discovered that fine minds, noble spirits and kindly hearts are to be found in many places, regardless of race, rank or creed. 

"Grace and I found a small one-room apartment with tiny kitchen and bath close to the Conservatory of Music where I registered and then faced the manager in his private office. I did not have the price of tuition, since the money I had been promised from home failed to arrive and my own earnings were insufficient. He waived immediate payment and as the year advanced gave me every advantage of discount plus a partial scholarship, In return I promised dedicated work and I kept my promise.

"I took vocal, piano, harmony, solfeggio, sight reading and history of music. My aim was to practice from five to six hours a day. I worked out a tight schedule and stuck to it. I didn't work otherwise except at a small job playing piano for a children's dance studio and as a paid singer at an Episcopal church on Sunday which came early enough for me to attend my own church service later. My health was good and my ambitions high.

"There were a number of other Utahns studying there. Among the male students and LDS missionaries we did not lack for dates but limited our dating to one night a week and Sunday afternoons. We were pretty selective in the things we attended - operas, concerts, the best in musical comedy, Shakespeare's plays, etc. I had an invitation to the Harvard Junior Prom that year - it was quite an occasion. Saturdays we sometimes went sight seeing to spots of historical interest or visited art galleries to browse.

"Though I received a little help from home occasionally and some from a business friend in Utah, yet by money standards I was 'poor', if not 'in need', although somehow I felt blessed and 'rich'.
<span id="page-694"></span>
I remember the time our cupboard was bare. I had spent my last quarter on apples and day old rolls. Having eaten these we were entirely without food. My pay wasn't due for a few days and Grace's check, usually so prompt, had not come. We prayed
earnestly that night but morning came and still nothing, We didn't eat the second day and repeated the prayers. Morning broke again but there was still no food. We went to school but both were weak. My prayers were constant though silent throughout that day. Returning home I found a letter from Uncle Henry Bartholomew containing a $10.00 bill. He said he thought I might be able to use it. I dropped to my knees in thanksgiving, then went out to market. We had more than one period of forced fasting!

"In the spring I had a letter from home saying I was needed badly. The family's finances had reached low ebb, father's health was in a poor state, and mother was desperate. The family had moved to Salt Lake into a shabby house on a bend of the Jordan River. I scraped up money for my fare and was on my way home in a matter of days. I found conditions as described with the necessity of getting an immediate job. I worked temporarily collecting for an insurance company and soliciting catering orders - it was hard and discouraging work. By fall I had landed a position in the Madison school, teaching music in the upper grades and another subject. J. Spencer Cornwall, music supervisor of the district, often visited my classes and asked me at one time if I intended to go east for further study. He had a plan in mind for teaching group piano in the grades and said if I could qualify he would give me the opportunity to start it. I determined to return to Boston.

"In the meantime, with the help of my earnings, things began looking up for the family. We left the old home on the bend of the Jordan and rented an attractive two story red brick house at 1876 South Main St. There were plenty of rooms for me a music studio and a sewing room for mother, who was beginning to make temple and burial clothes for the church at a fair profit. It was while living here that one of the main events of my life occurred. Through a blind date arranged 
<span id="page-695"></span>
by friends, I met Dr. Burtis F. Robbins who had just returned from his training in New York and was ready to start his practice. He looked distinguished but was a man of few words - mostly of one syllable, or so it seemed to me. I was used to being catered to and amused, if you please. The evening of dinner and dancing finally over he drove me home, stopped the car, and resting his hands on the wheel, remained silent. Strangely, at that moment an inner voice spoke to me in ringing clearness: 'Edythe, this is the man!' In my heart of hearts that first night I knew that Dr. Robbins was the one for me.

"He continued to date me - not often but consistently. He took me to many of the best things. He was a busy man setting up his practice, and besides was superintendent of the Sunday School and worked in the M.I.A. in the 18th Ward. I became active in the Farmers' Ward, counselor in M.I.A., director of the Ward plays and doing things musically - I'm sure Dr, Robbins was much sought after and I did my share of other dating. At one time I mentioned to him that come fall I thought of going east again. 'Oh, you don't want to do that' was his answer. Fall came and I prepared to go to Boston. I hadn't heard a word from my Dr. friend for three weeks and was hurt and left without a word to him. Arriving in Boston I received the longest letter I have ever received from Burtis - but no proposal of marriage.

"I threw myself into my work at the Conservatory - mostly piano, for which I had the best teacher of my career. I became engaged that winter to a young law student from Utah who was graduating from Harvard. No sooner was this done than I knew I couldn't go through with it. But how to get out of it without hurting him? There is no such thing - such things always hurt.

"I returned home the spring of 1925. Plans were laid for me to begin work teaching group piano in the fall. Burtis welcomed me with enthusiasm but dating went on the same - slowly. The winter went by and I also taught part of the summer. The fall of 1926 rolled around and with it my second year of teaching group piano. I took 
<span id="page-696"></span>
piano students after school. I was now twenty-six - goodness I was getting old! I longed for a husband and children of my own. Another young man was pressing me for marriage but I couldn't get my mind off Burtis. I spoke to Father about him, his seeming lack of gallantry and attention. 'What kind of a man do you really want - one who is doing big things or one who spends his energy doing little ones?' And he smiled.

"I had been blessed with much, especially experience, but still had no home of my own. I did some serious thinking and decided on a plan. I wrote my resolve in a long letter telling Burtis I was through. I would hand it to him the next time he came. It was to be dramatic - final! The day of Dec. 14th dawned. Burtis called that afternoon. I went to the door and extended the letter. He didn't take it but handed a small packet to me instead. It held a large, square-cut, glittering diamond. The wedding was set for Jan. 14th, one month away. Later that afternoon there arrived a box of long stemmed red roses, and they have been arriving on that same date every year since. We were married in the Salt Lake Temple by Pres. Heber J. Grant. I continued to teach to the end of that school year.

"That was forty-one years ago. Burtis has been a wonderful husband and provider. He has gone along with me in all my 'flights of fancy' whether it be the collecting of oriental rugs and other works of art, antique furniture buying, home remodeling and decorating, creative work with rock and wood, painting and sculpturing, twelve years with the Tabernacle choir, or travel to distant lands. He has been a wonderful father to our one boy and four girls. There was always money for lessons from the best teachers, violin, cello, piano and voice. There was money for them to study in distant cities and for our son's mission to Japan. There was always money for the important things. We had five Temple marriages in some over four years, including four beautiful home receptions for which nothing was spared.

Burtis has been a wonderful son-in-law, opening our home to Mother and furnishing her with her 
<span id="page-697"></span>
own apartment there as long as she lived and all else he could supply that her aging heart desired. He has been a wonderful member of the church, serving in numerous important capacities, the climax of which would surely be presiding over the East German Mission (later changed to North German) from Aug. 1957 to Dec. 1959, which included over 9,000 Saints, about half of whom were behind the Iron Curtain, where I labored with him among the people I had learned to love as a child.

"In the forty-one years my husband, children and grandchildren have always been my greatest joy and concern. My home has been my castle, whether our first rented apartment on 3rd Ave. and C St.; our first owned home at 121 B St.; our lovely home of sixteen years at 1176 East South Temple; our farm, where the Skyline High now stands, and the series of tents and cabins in which we lived there in summers from 1934 to 1956; or our beautiful 'dream house' at 3150 East 3600 South into which we moved following our mission.

"We have traveled extensively during our later years, sometimes taking our married children along, to many points of interest in the U.S.A., Canada, Alaska, the Holy Lands, Japan, China, Egypt, New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti, Fiji, Hawaii, and other distant lands. Some of these latter years have been marred for me by poor health, including a heart condition. I have been promised other trips if my health improves. These should include Mexico and South America. We might then see some of the Book of Mormon locales and artifacts first hand. I rest content however, a most blessed and privileged woman. My store of memories is rich and satisfying. It is not necessary that I be given more. As I have said and say of our five children I also say of our twenty-five grandchildren: 'These are my jewels!' The future is in their hands and I trust them."

## Christian LeRoy Christensen 

(10) Christian LeRoy Christensen (1) was
born 9 Jan, 1901 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah.
This was on a Tuesday. Roy, as he was most
often called, was the fourth child and second son
of the family. He was of a sweet and gentle nature
like his mother Caroline, round faced, blonde and
inclined to be rather plump as a child, He was
baptized a member of the L.D.S. church three
days after his eighth birthday, 12 Jan, 1909, in
the Manti Temple, undoubtedly being taken there
for the occasion by his grandmother, Else K.
Christensen.

Roy started school in Gunnison the fall of
1907. Those were the days when Beginner's Grade
preceded First Grade in most school districts.
His family moved to Salt Lake City the summer
of 1910, following the death of two of his sisters,
Elora, older, and Orilla just younger than he.
Here he started Third Grade in the Roosevelt
grade school about a mile from their lovely home
on 27th South 9th East, which his father had purchased
from his brother Andrew. Roy attended
school at Roosevelt through eighth grade and that
was the end of his formal schooling. But he continued
to read a lot, for he loved books.

From 1910 on most of the summers of his
youth were spent on the Weber Ranch in northeastern
Utah, along with others of his family.
After his schooling was over, however, he began
alternating with his older brother Elmer at some
sheep camp owned by the Bennion Livestock Company,
of which his father was part owner and
<span id="page-700"></span>
general manager, or taking care of his father's
land on The Oasis, not far from Lyman, Wyoming.
It was here on The Oasis that he spent the summer
and fall of 1917, along with his sister Pearl, and
where they became involved in the unforeseen and
heartbreaking circumstances of their beloved
Father's accident and death. Details of this have
been related earlier in this book.

Roy says that following his Father's death
Uncle Lou Christensen bought their property there
on The Oasis and paid for it as soon as he could.
He himself went back to Salt Lake City with his
mother and his younger brothers and sister. He
was then nearing seventeen but too young to serve
in World War I, then in progress. He became his
mother's mainstay, working around as he could
until 1922 when he went to Nevada with his older
sister Pearl and her husband Peter Jensen, and
worked in the mines in Eureka, Nevada for six
months. Then he went to McGill, Nevada and
worked until 1929, at which time he returned to
Salt Lake City to be near his mother. Being unable
to find work in Salt Lake to his liking, he returned
to McGill and has worked there ever since.

Not all heros are in uniform and it will
surely be to Roy's eternal credit that he took care
of his mother to the best of his ability throughout
all those years, as long as she lived. He shared
his monthly checks with her and did all else he
could for her happiness. His younger brother
Farrald says they just couldn't have gotten along
in the home then without the help Roy gave them.
Roy may still have blamed himself for his father's
untimely death, though circumstances entirely
absolved him, but a less sensitive and less dedicated
soul would have wearied of the long grind and gone
his own way.

Roy married a widow, Luella Ernstsen
Bennett, in Ely, Nevada 23 Dec. 1938, just two
and a half years before his mother's death. He
was within two and a half weeks of his thirty-eighth
birthday at the time and she was within a
week of her twenty-eighth. Luella writes of him: -
"I met Roy in McGill when I first came here in
January of 1930, being a small town everyone
<span id="page-701"></span>
knew everyone. My first husband and I lived in
McGill from soon after our marriage in 1929 until
he died, except for two years in Fillmore, Utah.

"I had three sons, five, seven and nine, when Roy
and I were married. He has been a good husband
and a wonderful father. He deserves much credit.
My boys love him very much and remember no
other father, since their own father died when
they were pretty young. Our own son, Christian
LaVell, was born in McGill the early part of 1940.

"We are pretty proud of our boys, they have
given us little trouble. The oldest is a heavy-duty
mechanic in Salt Lake City; the second is a sales
manager in Salt Lake; the third has graduated
from medical school at the University of Utah and
is now doing his intern; and Chris, as we call our
youngest, is now working in electronics in Richland, Washington. We have four lovely daughters-in-law and many beautiful grandchildren. Roy
himself works for the Kennecott Company here
in McGill as a pipefitter. He hopes to retire
when he is sixty-eight (1969).

"We own our own home in McGill, a duplex,
live in one side and rent the other. We both enjoy
good health except for a little arthritis. Roy used
to enjoy fishing and hunting but doesn't do much of
that any more, since he gets short winded when he
walks very far. He enjoys working in the yard and
flowers. We don't do much traveling as we try to
avoid traffic and big crowds. We have made several
trips to Los Angeles and San Diego, several to
Reno, Carson City, Virginia City, and to Piermont
Lake in Nevada. We have also visited Yellowstone
Park, Capitol Reef in southern Utah, and Lake
Tahoe.

"Like Roy's, my father's parents were emigrants
from Denmark who came to Zion for the
Gospel. My father, Ove Ernstsen, also born in
Denmark, is still living at 86 and has his own
home in Salt Lake City. His father lived to be 90.
There were eleven children in our family, nine
girls and two boys. Nine are still living. I myself
was born 30 Dec. 1910 in Loa, Utah and moved to
Salt Lake when I was fourteen. I attended Granite
High School there but quit in my third year and
<span id="page-702"></span>
went to work, I met and married my first husband
there in 1929, I have worked off and on for years
in cafes in McGill and Ely as a cook, but haven't
the past year or so due to arthritis. I enjoy sewing
very much and make all my granddaughters' dresses,
I am 5 ft. 3 inches high, weigh 123 lbs. and have
brown hair and eyes.

"Roy is 5 ft. 8 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs.
He has light hair and hazel eyes. Though his education
was limited he has read and studied a lot
and is a very intelligent man, He has many friends
and apparently no enemies. He doesn't have much
time for hobbies at present but enjoys our color TV
and card parties at the Elks Lodge twice a month.
Since we have so many friends in McGill and Ely,
we hope to continue to make our home here after
his retirement and plan a few trips by plane. We
want to visit my sister in Connecticut and many of
the ghost towns in Nevada."

Roy has not adopted the three Bennett boys,
sons of his wife and her first husband, Clarence
LeRoy Bennett - Merlyn LeRoy, Ernest Eugene
and Derral Duane, who are all married. But they
are very close to him as he is to them and their
families. He and Luella Ernsten have but the one
son of their own: -

1. Christian LaVell Christensen b. 3 Feb. 1940
in McGill, Nevada; md. 27 Aug. 1960 in Ely,
Nevada, Elva Gwen Steele (b. 23 May 1941 in
Ely to Alma Blaine and Elva Venice Drollinger
Steele), Children: -

    1. Gary LaVell Christensen b. 12 Sept. 1966
in Salt Lake City, Utah

    1. Jill Christensen, b. 1 July 1968 in Rich-
land, Washington.

## Virginia Christensen

(ll) Virginia Christensen (4) It is recorded
that I was born 6 Sept. 1901 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah,
the day United States President William McKinley
was assassinated. Aunt Elsie Bartholomew often
told me what a scrawny, homely baby I was and
how sorry Father felt for Mother, her having gone
through so much for such a poor specimen,
<span id="page-703"></span>

When I was a small girl Mother often told me
about the visit of a wandering gypsy to our home
while I was yet a babe. When she proudly showed
her first-born off to the visitor, the old woman
offered to tell my fortune, and the words she said
were - "When they're pretty when they're little
they'll be ugly when they're big and vice 
versa - this child will be a beautiful woman!" Whether
this pronouncement ever really took place or not I
have no way of knowing, yet I believed the story
then with all my heart and it remained in my memory 
and helped to buoy me up during my ugly duckling 
years. As a woman, however, my mirror has
never reflected "a beauty" and I have had to be 
satisfied with the thought that "beauty is as beauty
does". Some have said that I resemble my Danish
grandmother Else in looks, though not in stature.
Be that as it may I was not fortunate enough to
inherit lovely auburn tresses like hers.

When I reflect on my childhood I remember
it as being a wonderful time of learning, achieving,
and being appreciated and loved. Our big new
house into which we moved when I was nine was the
envy of my friends. My sister Elaine and I were
also envied by them because of the time our talented
mother took with us in teaching us singing, dramatics 
and such, and because of the numerous opportunities 
we had to "show off" because of it.

How I loved school! I could hardly wait for
each autumn when the school bell started ringing.
I attended school at Manti from "Beginners Grade"
into High School - from the red brick schoolhouse
to the white brick schoolhouse on the same block.
The day before my eighth grade graduation I
sprained my right thumb playing volleyball at
school and was forced to attend the graduation 
exercises with my black-and-blue thumb all
bandaged up. The hurt to my pride was worse
than the hurt to my digit, and needless to say I 
accepted my diploma with my left hand. A little
over a year after that graduation my darling
mother passed away and childhood for me came
to an end too. Life seemed much more serious
after that.

Following my two years at Manti High, Father
<span id="page-704"></span>
sent Elaine and me to attend B. Y. High at Provo.
He found a nice elderly couple there, the Oscar
Hydes, with whom we could room and board, and
instructed them to treat us like their own daughters.
This they faithfully tried to do and threw in plenty
of advice in the bargain. But when they started
calling us and our dates in for family prayers at
nine o'clock in the evenings, indicating that it was
time for us to retire, it was a little hard to take.

Father's last words as he left us that autumn
at the Hydes' in Provo had been, "Virginia, you are
the oldest and I shall hold you responsible not only
for your own conduct but for Elaine's as well." Now
at that time I was a worrier and dear fun-loving
sister Elaine took advantage of her new found freedom, 
which managed to keep me pretty worried.
She had a gay time trying her wings while I hardly
dared venture beyond Hydes and school. She became 
well acquainted with most everyone while I
walked my prim little way.

This was the winter of the great influenza
epidemic in Utah (1918/19) and Provo was not
spared. Prof. Clair Reid, our music teacher,
had Elaine and me join with six others of his vocal
students to form a double mixed quartet and sing
at funeral after funeral in the Provo cemetery, no
inside services being allowed then. We stood on
planks thrown over the muddy, snowy ground and
blended our voices in the hymns while Prof. Reid
pumped away at an old organ, which stood in a
small truck beside us, and played our accompaniment. 
One short funeral service followed another
and we moved around from place to place as coffin
after coffin was lowered into the frozen earth and
sobbing mourners stood around. So many died that
winter. Day after day we sang and shivered and
were awed by the sadness of it all. Neither Elaine
nor I took the flu that year, although others of our
roommates at Hydes came down with it.

The following winter when we returned to
Provo to school, some of Elaine's many friends
said, "We see you have brought your younger
sister with you this year." Indeed! Though I was
smaller of course I was older and more advanced
in school and had also been there the year before.
<span id="page-705"></span>
I was determined to worry less and have more fun
that year and it proved to be a challenging, wonderful 
one for me, both educationally and socially. I
was chosen to serve as High School Studentbody
vice-president. I took part in several plays under
the new college dramatic coach, Dr. T. Earl Pardoe. 
I sang in choruses, vocal ensembles, and
did some soprano solo work. I also met a young
man for the first time, by the name of Daniel
Keeler, although we had been students together
the year before. His home was just a block from
the Hydes where I lived again that year. We began
dating.

I graduated from B.Y. High the spring of
1920, while Elaine took the college preparatory
course of three years high school only, so that
we could enter as freshmen together at the University 
the next fall, which we did. That too was a
wonderful school year for me. I was elected vice-president 
of the freshman class. Elaine and I took
private vocal from the new voice teacher, Prof.
Florence Jepperson (later Dr. Florence J. Madsen).
Again I took part in dramas, choruses, etc., and
had a lead in the college opera. I was a member
of the ladies trio that was chosen to represent BYU
at the Utah State Fair that year. Elaine and I began 
singing duets together and with Prof. Jepperson 
as our coach and often our accompanist and
we were soon in much demand for school, church
and community functions. For the third straight
year we lived at Oscar and Stella Hydes'. Again 
I dated Daniel Keeler, star basketball and football
player and trackman.

Second year college was also great and again
dramatic and musical activities took much of my
time and attention. I was also assistant editor of
the college literary magazine that year. Elaine 
and I, together with five of our very special girl
friends, organized one of the first, if not the first,
social clubs at BYU. At first we called ourselves
the "Seven Sisters" which was later changed to the
more sophisticated O. S. Trovata. I was active in
Mask Club and for this group presented a dramatic
reading of the three-act play "Merely Mary Ann".
One of the most exciting experiences of that year,
<span id="page-706"></span>
however, was when I returned to my hometown of
Manti and sang as guest lead in the high school
operetta "Chimes of Normandy" under the direction
of one of my early music teachers, Ellis E. Johnson, 
who was a pillar of musical strength in Manti
for nearly half a century.

Summers at home in Manti were busy times.
There was always plenty of work to do even after
Father married "Aunt Myrtle" in June 1920 and
brought her home to mother us. I had many friends
and "our crowd" had lots of good times together.
Among other summer activities I usually took piano
lessons from Prof. Lavoir Jensen but my fingers
were too short to really achieve in that field.

Most of the summer of 1922 I spent at Starr
Ranch keeping house for the farm hands in the
"south home". Among the group who had to put
up with my cooking were my brother Sherman,
Uncle Joe Snow, and the foreman of the ranch,
Mr. Christopherson, whose wife had gone away
to have a baby. My friend, Daniel Keeler, was
in Canada that summer and I corresponded with
him. Each afternoon I saddled a horse and rode
a mile or so to the little village of Mona to mail
the letters I had written and pick up any there for
me. I often bought crochet thread at the one small
joint store and post office that place afforded. I
spent the evenings working on my trousseau, for
by then I was contemplating marriage.

Back to Provo and B. Y. U. that September
I was plunged headlong into my busiest school year
ever. I was nominated as a candidate for Studentbody 
vice-president. The campaign was a hot one
and I lost to Alice Ludlow, now the wife of present
president of B. Y. U., Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson.
My disappointment was soon smothered in a maze
of other activities. The very day of the election I
got word that my essay had been chosen as one of
the best in the Heber J. Grant oratorical contest
preliminaries. I later gave my paper, "Obedience
to Law", as an oration in the contest and won first
place, for which I received an autographed book
and congratulations from the President of the
church, Heber J. Grant. It was only the second
year for the Grant oratorical contest which is still
<span id="page-707"></span>
held yearly at B. Y. U.

I took my "teacher training" teaching a college
class in harmony, since I planned to graduate at
the end of two terms of summer school the following 
summer. I had kept my grades high and taken
the maximum load, in spite of all the extracurricular 
activities in which I had engaged. These extra
activities continued throughout that school year.

Daniel M. Keeler, most always called "Dan",
came down to Manti on Christmas Eve and gave me
a diamond. We were married during the holidays,
3 Jan. 1923, in the Salt Lake Temple. We had no
reception - this was a difficult time financially for
Father and Aunt Myrtle who, bless their hearts,
did the best for us they could. Father gave me
$100.00 and Aunt Myrtle gave us three or four
new pieced quilts she had just made for the family,
and sewed lingerie for me during the holidays,
working night and day at it although she was
expecting her second child. My "hope chest" was
the old family trunk that had been my mother's and
which I still have as a "costume trunk". My Uncle
Warren and Kate Snow of Salt Lake City gave us a
wedding supper at their home and we stayed at the
Hotel Utah overnight for our honeymoon, returning
to Provo the next evening and school the following
Monday morning as Mr. and Mrs.

The extra activities continued as before.
One of the most enjoyable activities of my college
career was taking a lead in Victor Herbert's comic
opera "The Red Mill", May 14, 1923. My husband
Dan also took a comic lead in that production,
which was mostly a dramatic part in which he
could "fake" the singing. I continued on to summer
school for the first term of six weeks but was
forced to drop out for the second term with only
a few more credit hours to go towards my graduation.
Elaine dropped out for the following winter
and taught in Manti, in hopes that we could both
return to college after my baby (Daniel) was born
and graduate together. But it was twenty-one
years before I returned to B.Y.U. as a student.

In the interim Dan was forced to quit school
and go to work, and we moved to Carbon county,
<span id="page-708"></span>
Utah, living first in Price where he sold cars for
his brother-in-law's agency; then in Helper where
he operated a service station, and finally to the
mining camp of Latuda where he eventually went
into the coal mine there. It was by then the time
of the great depression and jobs were scarce. Our
second child, Jennie, was born in my folks' lovely
home in Manti just a short time before they turned
it over to their creditors and moved to Provo and
later Orem. Our third child, Colleen, was born
in Helper. Our fourth child, Ellen, was born at
my folks' home in Orem, and our fifth child,
Phillip, was born in Standardville, Utah, our first
hospital-born baby.

Church activity and service were important
to us. I taught in the Primary in Price. In Helper
I was a Relief Society visiting teacher for the first
and only time and then was called to be president
of the Primary. One of the interesting experiences
during this service was the Primary operetta "Rose
Dream" we put on in a local theatre in connection
with the picture show. I directed and staged this
production, my first counselor took charge of costumes 
and scenery, and my second counselor
accompanied on the piano. The operetta was given
to a packed house just ten days before our daughter
Colleen was born.

In Latuda we attended Standardville Branch
a mile or so away - walking to and fro most of the
time. In Relief Society I served in almost every
capacity except that of president, also directing a
number of special activities, including a "kitchenette 
band" to raise money for our Relief Society
library project. I put on one-act plays. I taught
a class in Sunday School. My most satisfying
church service there, however, was being president 
of the Y. L. M. I. A. for more than three
years. I also directed the music and drama most
of the time, since we seldom could find anyone else
who would do it in that very small branch. During
this time the ladies' chorus which I organized and
directed won the Stake contest, the District,and
was chosen to go to Salt Lake City to participate
in the All Church Chorus in the Tabernacle for
M. I. A. June conference, where it sang under
<span id="page-709"></span>
the direction of the guest conductor Noble Cain,
nationally known composer and musician.

Ours was rather an odd looking chorus made
up of both young singers and some who were older.
There were two old maid school teachers from
Nebraska who were Methodists, a tall thin one and
a short plump one, and a very young new convert
straight from England among the fourteen singers
we had mustered. This young convert said to me
once, walking home from practice, "Can one be
baptized over again? You know there is hardly
anything I haven't tried!" Our accompanist was
the wife of the Principal of Latuda Junior High
and she was a good one. Our winning number was
"O Divine Redeemer". All my efforts, prayers
and spent time were more than rewarded when
Brother Robinson of the M. I. A. General Board
stood up in the Tabernacle at one of the general
conference meetings to evaluate the M. I. A. arts
program and said, among other things, "Out of
the smoke, dust, grime and desolation of a coal
camp has come one of the most divine ladies
choruses I have ever heard!" I knew he meant
our chorus and my eyes filled with tears as I
trembled with emotion.

It was while living in Latuda that I first became 
seriously interested in genealogy, encouraged
by my husband's lovely parents, Joseph B. and
Martha Alice Fairbanks Keeler, who were both
experienced genealogists. I began to search the
records for my progenitors, going occasionally to
the Genealogical Library in Salt Lake City, then a
rather humble institution in comparison with today's
world-famous organization. Dan and I both served
on the Branch and then the Stake genealogical committees.
Then he was called to serve as a counselor 
in the Branch presidency and later as
Standardville Branch President, serving as such
for a number of years.

I taught vocal music in the Latuda Junior
High School one year and was "drafted" to teach
the same at Carbon High School and Carbon Junior
College in Price the spring quarter of 1942, when
their music instructor, Ferris Edgley, was drafted
into the service. I rode back and forth on the school
<span id="page-710"></span>
bus, leaving Ellen and Phillip in the care of some
close neighbors and distant relatives, the Moffitts.
Colleen was in Jr. High at Helper and Dan and
Jennie attending Carbon High School, so they rode
the bus with me. Our son Dan graduated that 
spring. I prepared the music for the Baccalaureate
and Commencement services - it was a real challenge. 
A few years before I had been invited to join
a Price community ladies chorus which twice each
year joined the city's male chorus in a public concert. 
I was one of the leading soloists in their
presentation of Handel's Messiah at Christmastime
two different years.

Being concerned with the cultural disadvantages
of raising our children in a mining camp we did all
we could to combat this. Colleen took violin lessons,
Jennie studied the cello and Dan Jr. the bass fiddle,
as well as the mellaphone. We organized a string
quartet for a short time, with me playing the piano.
We had a family chorus but lacked a tenor. Jennie
and two of her little friends were organized into a
girls trio which we called "The Three Little Maids."
They sang often at school and church. They won
first place in the Elks talent contest in Price one
year and Colleen won second on her violin. I
accompanied both. We sought the outstanding musical 
program on our radio. The children especially
enjoyed the "All Girl Orchestra." Dan Jr. was in
both the Jr. High and High School bands. We
encouraged him and attended all his programs.
We sang at our work around the house, in unison
or harmony. I can recommend singing together
as a bridge to the "generation gap" in the family.
We seldom had disciplinary problems with our
children.

In the spring of 1943 we moved back to Provo.
There were few houses for sale in the vicinity of
B.Y.U. where we wished to settle, at a price that
we could afford. We finally found an old two-story
one at 362 North 400 East. We bought it and moved
in on election day in Nov. 1944. We have been
remodeling and fixing it up ever since and are
still at it. Dan has done so much work on it,
carrying out many of my ideas for beauty and his
for comfort. We have always worked well together
<span id="page-711"></span>
as a team. One of the children once said, "There
is hardly anything that Mother can't 'make up' or
Daddy can't 'make'", referring at the time to an
M.I.A. roadshow I had concocted that needed as
a backdrop a giant rising moon in action. Dan
made the moon and it was so realistic that old
Ward members still talk about it.

As soon as we were comfortably settled in
Provo I went back to college at B.Y.U. Both
campuses were within easy walking distance of
our home. The requirements for graduation had
increased since I was a student there twenty-one
years before - the classes were "stiffer". I
changed my major from drama to music and took
as many classes each quarter for the next year,
including summer, to secure enough credits for
graduation. The graduation committee voted in
my favor and I understood later that the members
had included the excellent singing of my older 
daughters whom I had trained as one of my musical 
assets. I graduated in June 1945 with honors.
It was a dream come true!

Our church service did not diminish in Provo,
Dan became a counselor in the Ward Sunday School
Superintendency, a member of the Stake Seventies
Quorum Presidency for many years, and finally
President of the High Priests group in the Ward.
I served on the Relief Society Stake Board as
chorister and directed the Stake "Singing Mothers".
I assisted with and sang in the Relief Society Singing 
Mothers Centennial Chorus that presented a
concert in the Salt Lake Tabernacle in 1947 under
the direction of Florence J. Madsen. I directed
choruses, plays and roadshows for the ward M.I.A.
and served as Y.L.M.I.A. president, first in the
Fifth Ward, Provo Stake and then, when that Ward
was divided, in the Eighth Ward of East Provo
Stake for well over three years, or until my health
broke. I then served as editor of the Eighth Ward
paper for a year-and-a-half.

In the meantime, besides engaging in some
club and civic work, I trained and accompanied our
two daughters, Jennie and Colleen, in vocal duet
work and they became much in demand for programs, 
not only locally but throughout the county.
<span id="page-712"></span>
I organized and directed a group of seven of our
youngest daughter Ellen's little friends in a singing
group we named "The Singing Sallies". They too
were called upon to sing at church, school and
community functions without number. These were
only a very few of the activities, both musical and
otherwise, engaged in by members of our family.
Indeed we were a busy family.

Dan worked for Geneva Steel near Provo for
well over twenty years. He was active in politics
and served as Republican district chairman for
sixteen years and as a delegate to the State Republican 
Convention every election year during that
period. He has always been a great sports fan
and has followed the activities of the B. Y. U. football 
and basketball teams with enthusiasm over
these past twenty-five years. He loves to garden
and raises lovely flowers, potting his numerous
geranium plants each winter in a make-shift nursery 
in the basement. Together we raise beautiful
house plants, including African violets. Dan loves
to travel and he has taken numerous trips with our
eldest son, Dan, into the southern and eastern
"wonderlands" of Utah on filming excursions for
educational TV, in which the younger Dan is
engaged. The older Dan and I have driven by car
to visit our married children in New York, New
Jersey, California and Arizona. We recently flew
for a two weeks visit to a daughter's family in
Cleveland, Ohio and visited early church points of
interest while there. In these later years I have
sometimes longed to travel to distant lands, especially 
Denmark, should my health permit. But so
far I have had to be content mostly with being an
"arm chair traveler," where that is concerned,

Since retiring two years ago from Geneva
Steel Dan has been serving as Eighth Ward clerk,
from which position he has recently been released.
Presently the two of us are working hard together
on both of our genealogies with some success. He
goes often to the Salt Lake Temple and Genealogical
Society. He has had excellent health over the years
with the exception of a heart attack which he suffered
five years ago and from which he has made remarkable 
recovery.
<span id="page-713"></span>

On the other hand my physical health has
been rather poor for the past dozen years as I
suffer from rhumatoid arthritis. Severe surgery
for cancer eight years ago brought me to the
realization that I might not have too many more
years to live; that I still had important work to do
and should be getting at it in dead earnest! But
just what was the most important work for me to
engage in during my "bonus" years? Genealogy
was my first answer. Then recalling a blessing
I had been given a few weeks after my marriage
by my husband's father, who was then Patriarch
of Provo Stake, I began to puzzle over these statements 
in it: "You have many gifts of the spirit and
natural endowments.... You have the gift and power
of language - the ability to express your thoughts
by word of mouth and by writing. Cultivate this
gift and God will bless you, for your words will
fly as on the wings of morning to the delight and
benefit of many people; thus returning to you after
many days like bread cast upon the waters."

I had never thought of myself as being much
of a writer since my freshman English class in
composition at B.Y.U., where Elaine got straight
A's and I was lucky to come off with C's; the only
C's I ever received in college as I recall. I had
always considered Mother, Elaine and Sherman
as the writers of our particular Christensen 
family - and still do. Yet here in this blessing
was an indication that I could write and should
improve the talent. Why not combine genealogy
and writing?

In 1962 I published a history and genealogy
of some of my mother's people, the Van Burens.
I did it as a missionary project to try and have a
hand in turning the hearts of my dear relatives
towards their fathers. It was not planned to be a
financial success - and was not. But, like bread 
cast upon the waters, much joy and satisfaction
has come to me through this endeavor - and the
end is not yet in sight. I had long had a desire
to write my Grandmother Christensen's history
so I turned to that. My Christensen book will be
the result. Already the happiness I have gained
through the interest, kindnesses and willing
<span id="page-714"></span>assistance of my many wonderful Christensen
cousins and their descendants in this project has
made it more than worth while. I feel that the
descendants of Laurs and Else K. Christensen
have grown closer together in spirit and understanding.
What more could I ask? I couldn't
have done either of these books without the unselfish
help of my fine husband - he has gone along with me
every step of the way.

Dan and I continue to find happiness and
satisfaction in the programs of the church. We
marvel at its growth and fulfillment of prophecy.
The Gospel of the Master is still our guide and
inspiration. Yet abundant joy comes to us from 
association with our five outstanding children and
twenty-six lovely grandchildren and we cannot help
but feel that they are perhaps our greatest assets
in this life. We have complete confidence that
these cherished family relationships will continue
beyond mortality and will weather all else that
may stand between earth life and the eternities 
- forever. How else could there be Heaven there
for us?

## Florence LaFaun Christensen

(12) Florence LaFaun Christensen (7) was
born 12 Dec. 1901 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. She
married first, in Evanston, Wyoming, Benjamin
Eugene Slagowski. Shortly afterwards, 8 June 1921,
the marriage was solemnized in the Salt Lake
Temple. Twenty-four years and some months
later, 12 Nov. 1945, a temple divorce separated
them. On 17 Nov. 1950 in Elko, Nevada, LaFaun
married her second husband, Ray Hatch Butler, a
widower with one son. This marriage ended
shortly in divorce.

LaFaun has written a sketch of some of her
activities over the years, from which we 
quote:-- "In Gunnison, Utah I sang a solo in Primary 
conference at age five; was Sunday School organist at
age eleven with Aunt Elsie Bartholomew as chorister;
had a lead in the High School operetta "Windmills 
of Holland" directed by Lillie Mellor Metcalf.
In Evanston, Wyoming:- While in High School I had
my name engraved on a silver loving cup trophy in
honor of our girls basketball team who won over
all the State--I was the center; was Primary Stake
organist and organist on the Relief Society Stake
Board, the youngest Stake Board member in the
church at that time, according to Woodruff Stake
President John M. Baxter; I traveled through the
Stake with missionaries, playing for conferences
and occasionally speaking in different Wards; I was
hired by James Brown to be a substitute for the
Evanston Court reporter, Clarence Cook, when he
was out of town; I played for silent movies and with
Smuin's and Toy's orchestras for dances, with
Starkey's and Christensen's orchestra and the
Evanston High School orchestra. I worked part
time in Father's office while he was sheriff.

"In Salt Lake City, Utah:- I typed reports for
my husband who worked for the Secret Service
there. In Ogden, Utah:- I was a member of the
Ogden Tabernacle choir for twenty-one years;
assisted Mr. Lester Henchcliff in directing the
Singing Mothers and with the training of students
<span id="page-717"></span>
and soloists for the choir; was offered a scholarship
to the Chicago School of Music but did not
accept because I had four children at the time and
taught piano and vocal, up to twenty-five students
for years. I directed operettas for Primary and
M.I.A. in the Ogden Fourth Ward, also Relief
Society cantatas and Boy Scout choruses. I
directed an opera for the Weber Stake M.I.A.;
directed the Twenty-Second Ward choir; directed
Weber Stake M.I.A. chorus concerts in the Tabernacle, 
with as many as two hundred and seventy-five 
teenagers participating at a time, and directed
the singing in the Seven Stake Recreation meetings.

"San Francisco, Calif.:- (1945-1946) I sang
in operas with the Travis Opera Co. and with the
Player's Club, during which time I was Sunday
School chorister in the San Francisco Ward. 
Salt Lake City, Utah:- I was choir director for the
Central Park Ward, 1946/47, during which time
we presented Handel's 'Messiah'; was McKay
Ward organist for a time and then director of the
Ward choir, during which time we presented the
'Messiah' for Easter. I directed a junior choir
of eight and nine year olds in three-part singing
in Crystal Heights Ward (the Bishop's name was
Stutz); was soloist with the Wilford Ward choir
(director Brother Ray); Sunday School chorister
in the Rose Park Ward (Bishop Newell Linford);
and was choir director in the Emerson Ward,
where I presented Handel's 'Messiah', using my
son Don Slagowski and his wife Betty as two of
the soloists, I also presented the 'Messiah' in the
Poplar Grove Ward for Mrs. Ririe; in Memory
Grove two seasons at Eastertime in both the
Twenty-first and the Thirteenth Wards and also
in Central Park Ward for the second time after
twenty years. I served as Twenty-first Ward
Sunday School chorister and as Ward organist;
chorister for 'Sociables', an adult group sponsored
by the General Board of the M.I.A, and directed
their chorus in a presentation of 'The Seven Last
Words of Christ' at Eastertime at Memory Grove.
I was called on a mission by President David O.
McKay to work in the Genealogical Library for
two years, 1963-65, to convert genealogy sheets
records to magnetic tape - I completed my mission,
<span id="page-718"></span>

"I worked for the U. S. Government between
ten and eleven years in the Adj-General's office
and in nearly all departments of the Veteran's
Administration regional office. I then acted as
medical secretary at the LDS Hospital for eight
and a half years and as medical secretary supervisor
during seven of those years, interviewing
and training medical secretaries, taking doctors'
dictations and taking full charge of thirty dictating
machine stations, etc. I then became medical
secretary for the Primary Children's Hospital for
two years, retiring from there 30 Dec. 1966."

LaFaun bought a nice home in Bountiful and
moved there about the time of her retirement. Her
children were all married, with some of them living
in Bountiful. The habits of a lifetime could not be
discarded; LaFaun became Ward organist and
Junior Sunday School chorister in the Bountiful
Val Verda Ward. She had an opportunity to go back
to work at the LDS Hospital so she sold her home
in Bountiful after a year to one of her sons and
moved back to Salt Lake City into a small condominium,
buying her own apartment there on Vine
Street just north of the Salt Lake Temple. She
went often to the Temple.

Having been divorced for many years from
her husband and father of her six children, Ben
Slagowski, LaFaun was married in the Salt Lake
Temple 16 May 1968 to a widower with two grown
daughters, Willis Little Jacobson (b. 25 July 1897
in Colonia Diaz, Chihuahua, Mexico to James and
Harriet Little Jacobson). Willis has served
several missions in Mexico and is an ardent temple
worker and genealogist. They moved to his home
in West Jordan but kept her apartment on Vine
Street. LaFaun directed a presentation of 'The
Creation' not long afterwards and then left for a
trip to Europe. We received a card from her dated
in Zurich, Switzerland 16 June 1968, with a message
as follows:- "Dear Folks: Have been to London
and tried out the Hyde Park organ; also having a
copy of my great-grandmother's marriage certificate
sent to me from Somerset House. Toured
Holland - Amsterdam is the largest seaport in the
world - enjoyed it more than Pearl Harbor in
<span id="page-719"></span>
Hawaii. Toured Germany - now in Zurich,
Switzerland - then on to Austria, Venice, Rome,
Florence, Pisa - then Paris. I hope I can get a
plane out of Paris to join my British Mission Tour
in London for my return home. Will be gone a
month on my honeymoon - alone! Then together
we'll go to California and then Mexico. It will be
quite a summer for me. Love, LaFaun." While
in London and Switzerland she entered the LDS
temples there - it was a wonderful experience.
She and Willis were all ready to go to Mexico City
when her brother Rex passed away. They postponed 
their trip for a few days until after the
funeral. They were in Mexico during the Olympics
there.

We received another card from LaFaun not
long ago - this one dated 15 Feb. 1969 in Hamilton,
New Zealand. She wrote, "Darlings: Had a wonderful 
night again at the Polynesian Center in
Hawaii. Landed on the Fiji Islands and saw very
green lawns and beautiful flowers. Toured Auckland, 
New Zealand and now will be here for a
couple of days. Today we go to the New Zealand
temple and this will mean that I have gone to all
our temples in the world. I have planned this for
many years. Again, my husband wouldn't come.
He wants to go to Mexico again alone, so I decided
to complete my plans. Love, LaFaun C. Jacobson."

So for LaFaun a dream has come true - many
dreams in fact.

## Alma Owen Bartholomew

(13) Alma Owen Bartholomew (5) was born
1 May 1902 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. He has
most always been called A. Owen. His mother
gave the following account of him in her Book of
Remembrance:- "A. Owen was born in an upper
room in his grandfather Bartholomew's home in
Fayette. Both his grandmothers were in attendance,
Grandmother Christensen as the midwife and Grandmother
Bartholomew caring for our wants. He was
blessed 1 June 1902 in the Fayette Ward by his
grandfather, Bishop John Bartholomew. He moved
with his parents to Gunnison, Utah in 1907, where
he was baptized 10 May. 1910 by John Larson and
confirmed the same day by Andrew Thomson. He
was ordained a Deacon 7 Nov. 1915 by Ernest
Swalberg in Gunnison and attended school there
until the spring of 1916.

On 27 Mar. 1916 he moved with his mother
and brothers and sisters to a homestead ranch
some miles east of Lyman, Wyoming (called The
Oasis) where he helped his mother and the neighbors
on the ranch in summers and attended the
Public School and High School at Lyman in winters.
He was interested in basketball.

"In the spring of 1918 his father bought a nice
new brick home in Ogden, Utah in the Fourth Ward
where the family moved. That fall A. Owen entered
Weber Church College (High School) and attended
that school year 1918/19. Here he did some outstandin
g work in art and was a member of the
basketball team. He was ordained a Teacher in
the priesthood 7 Apr. 1919 in Ogden.

"At the children's request the family returned
to Lyman, Wyoming the next fall and A. Owen
attended high school there that winter. In the
spring they moved to Goshen, Utah on a farm
<span id="page-722"></span>
which he helped his father operate, but the next
winter, 1920/21, he returned to the Wyoming area
to work in the timber. This he did for two successive
winters, living with a family by the name
of Foreman, for whom he worked. By that time
his father was employed in the carpenter shop at
the Tintin Standard Mine near Dividend, Utah, and
A. Owen went to work with him and there is where
he learned his trade as a carpenter and builder.

"On 12 June 1925 he married a Goshen girl,
Anna Patricia Riley, in a civil ceremony in Salt
Lake City, Utah. (She was born 1 Feb. 1902 in
Goshen, the daughter of John Theodore and Margaret
Halpin Riley). A. Owen and Pate, as she
was called, first lived in Goshen and he continued
work at the Tintic Mine shop, driving back and
forth. He worked here from 1922 to 1942 until he
was the oldest man there in point of service. From
1942 to 1945 he worked as a supervisor in the 
construction of the Geneva Steel Company plant near
Provo, Utah. In the meantime he had bought a
home in Payson close to that of his parents."

He left Geneva and went into construction on
his own for a few years, building houses, etc. He
then joined the Davis Construction Company as
supervisor of construction and worked for that
company for many years, or until he became ill.
As A. Owen tells it, "I decided to retire due to my
poor health but I recovered and did not enjoy being
idle so went back to work again for the same company."
A little later he went to work for the Rosenlof 
Construction Company. Among other things, he
has supervised the construction of numerous disposal
plants throughout the intermountain area and
on the coast over the years, his most recent one
being the one at his hometown of Payson, Utah.

"A. Owen retired from construction in May
of 1968. Since then he has been supervising at the
Payson disposal plant, working the equivalent of
two days a week, which is about all the law allows
for a retired person. Perhaps now he will have a
little more time to indulge some of his favorite
hobbies. He loves the great out-of-doors and to
hunt and fish. In April this year (1969) he and
Pate will visit their eldest son in Memphis,
<span id="page-723"></span>
Tennessee--that is, as Pate says, if they can get
their bags packed and on their way before a new
baby comes along in the family; for at such times
Pate is always called to "baby sit" - and she loves
it! The two occasionally drive out to Uinta County,
Wyoming to visit friends. A. Owen says that "The
Oasis" is a big sheep ranch now and much of the
land around is covered with gas wells.

At present A. Owen's once light auburn hair
is beginning to gray. He used to stand at five feet
eleven inches, but says he thinks he has "shrunk"
a little in the last few years. His health is comparatively 
good. Though he never did much with
his ability in art, the talent seems to have been
passed on to his children, some of whom have been
outstanding in this field, Elayne as a dancer and
Philip as a designer and decorator of some note.

## Orilla Christensen 

(14) Orilla Christensen (1) was born 14 Aug.
1902 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah and died 22 May
1910 in Gunnison of scarlet fever five days before
the death of her older sister, Inger Elosa, who
died of the same disease. Orilla lived to be seven
years nine months and eight days old. She was
buried in the Gunnison City Cemetery.

## Ruth Ellen Christensen

(15) Ruth Ellen Christensen (3) was born in
Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 7 Oct. 1902. She was
delivered by her grandmother Else K. Christensen.
The account of her birth has been given in some
detail in an earlier part of this book. She was
baptized 11 Oct. 1910 in the Manti Temple. She
grew up in a family of boys for her two only sisters
died soon after their births. To these five fine
brothers, towering above her, she has always been
a most loving and helpful sister. They always
speak of her with great affection and love to visit
at her home.

Ruth herself has written a brief history of
her married years, from which we quote:-- "I
married Niels Franklin Hansen (born 28 Nov. 1899
in Centerfield, Sanpete, Utah to Hans Christian
and Anna Margaret Nielson Hansen) in Richfield,
Utah 30 June 1921. We have had a wonderful
marriage. (Cousin Byron Peterson says that
Ruth and Frank lived in his parents' home for a
short time when they were first married.) Our
first child, Franklin Duane, was born in the home
<span id="page-725"></span>
of Annie Gledhill, sister of the other Bishop
Joseph Christensen. When Ellen Maxine, our
second child, was six weeks old we rented and
moved into the home I had grown up in. She
caught cold and it developed into bronchial asthma.
We have raised her on prayer since then but she
still isn't well.

"After four children the doctor said I wasn't
able to have any more. On Dec. 7, 1937 I had
triple surgery in Salt Lake City and a little over
one year and three months after that our lovely
daughter, LaDon was born. On 25 Oct. 1948
had triple surgery again and on 9 Mar. 1966 I had
another major operation - so now I should be in
fine shape.

"We lived in Sterling, Utah for awhile and
while there I taught sewing in the three older 
primary grades in the local school for two years, to
prepare them for High School in Manti, the first
year without pay. I taught sewing two years here
in San Diego one day a week, under the direction
of the Adult Education program, and turned my
check over to the Ward Bishop for our building
fund project. I did alterations in a dress-making
shop here for several years, long enough to-earn
Social Security.

"I have taught in M.I.A. and Relief Society
(Theology) and been a Relief Society Work Counselor. 
My latest service was eighteen months as
a Sunday School teacher while Frank was in the
Sunday School Superintendency. Our son Duane
has worked with the Scouts for years. His wife,
Jean, is now Primary president, after having
served eight years as Sunday School Coordinator.
Our daughter Maxine's health does not permit
much activity but her children are all active in
the church. Garth Joseph in 1950 was all-star
softball pitcher for the church and brought the
trophy back to our then-new Ward. Since then he
has been Y.M.M.1.A. president, Branch president, 
a Stake High Councilman, on a Stake mission
and in the Stake Mission presidency and had many
other responsibilities in the church. He is now
bishop of his Ward in Escondido, Calif. His wife
Joan used to teach Seminary, then served on the
<span id="page-726"></span>
Relief Society Stake Board. Norma was the queen
of the first Gold and Green ball in our new Ward.
LaDon is teaching in Sunday School and has a troop
of Cub Scouts; she used to teach in Primary.

"I feel that perhaps one of my greatest
achievements is my long list of friends and the
many children besides our own grandchildren who
call Frank and me 'Grandpa' and 'Grandma'. I
was written up one year in Neal Morgan's newspaper 
column as having received one hundred
birthday cards that year. In 1967 we received
two hundred and two Christmas cards, plus other
greetings - so much love!" On the back of many
of the friendly letters that Ruth sends out is a
little sticker bearing the following message:-- "Dear 
Letter; go upon your way, over mountain,
plain or sea. God bless all who speed your flight
to where I wish you to be. And bless all those
beneath the roof where I would bid you rest. But
bless much more the one to whom this letter is
addressed." This message is so typical of the
love and goodwill Ruth bears her relatives and
friends and people everywhere.

Ruth and Frank make occasional trips back
to Utah, especially at deer season when Frank
goes to hunt. Their last trip to date was to attend
Ruth's brother Harold's funeral. Frank recently
retired and Ruth writes of this:-- "Frank has just
retired after twenty-three years as a civilian
employee of the U. S. Navy, teaching the apprentices
in electronics. He said he didn't realize how
important he had been until he was through and
they said so many nice things about him. 'It was
just like attending my own funeral' he said. He
had his picture taken with the 'Captain of the
Island' and other naval dignitaries." During this
time they have lived in San Diego. Perhaps now
they will find time for more trips to visit relatives
and friends.

## Ellen Elaine Christensen 

(16) Ellen Elaine Christensen (4) writes her
own story and begins with the question, "What am
I?" Then she answers it as follows:

"I'm a contradiction and a conflict both within
and without: Without, because I often feel lithe,
beautiful, free and graceful; but on passing a
mirror or on seeing my silhouetted shadow before
me, I am well aware of the contradiction. Inside,
because I want to be good, kind, noble and great
but am beset by the willful, stubborn drives of a
true daughter of Ephraim. So many of the faults
I dislike in others, I possess; so external, internal
and eternal conflicts war. However, I have always
had great patterns to copy and am a ready repenter,
hoping for the years to mellow and perfect me; and
perhaps they will - not in and of themselves but
because of the influence of friends, family, church,
<span id="page-729"></span>
and God who hears and answers my prayers.

"I know that, looking back on one's youth,
memory makes childhood a constant summer. I
have heard no tale of unusual happenings when I
was born, 12 Oct. 1902 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah,
except that Aunt Retta was furious with Father
because I came along, a ten pound tub of a baby,
to 'little Jennie' her sister, when my sister Virginia 
was but thirteen months and six days old.
Our first home was on 155 North 2nd West. I
remember the house as a two-story white brick
structure set back from a black iron fence, a
space of lawn parted by a gravel path which led
to a front porch and then on around the south side
of the house to a kitchen entrance and farther on
to a large back lot with garden plot, woodpile,
outhouse and a corral.

"Inside the house on the ground floor were a
parlor (seldom used in winters) one bedroom,
kitchen, pantry, non-plumbed bathroom, and
dining room, the latter being the family gathering
place. Here and in the kitchen were coal stoves
which furnished the only heat. I remember white
starched lace curtains at the dining room windows,
a square table, chairs, a couch bed, and the pot-bellied
stove behind which we children played house.
The old range in the kitchen was also a gathering
place, in the warmth of whose open oven door we
took our baths in a galvanized tin tub before donning
either our nightgowns or our long-legged fleece-
lined cotton union suits and long black stockings,
bloomers, flannel petticoats and starched dresses.
I remember the hum of the kettle and its steam
coating the windows which steam turned to crystal
frost before morning. We had to scratch it away
with our fingernails before we could peer out.

"There was one partially finished bedroom
upstairs, used only in summers, which we
reached by climbing up steep wooden steps, past
naked spaces of beams, braces, brick chimney
and sloping, dusty eaves of the attic - a scary
place of creaking sounds, lurking spiders and
bats - yet a place of wonders because here through
the small and only window I was lifted up to see
Haley's Comet and shivered for the end of the world.
<span id="page-730"></span>

"One of our special amusements was a chair-swing 
in which we played 'train'. Although the little
boys were rough and pushed it to its limit, the
swing lasted for years. Once, for some unknown
reason, I built a fire under this swing; but when I
heard mother phoning the police (with her finger on
the receiver) my repentance was swift and tearful.
One of our greatest (yet most horrifying) sports
was to be chased by the little boys with daddy-long-legs
which always seemed to be plentiful. The
dread of these kinds of insects has lasted me
throughout life.

"It was here at this old house that I learned
that if you hid raw eggs too long before Easter
they didn't smell very good. Starting two or three
weeks before Easter, our entire family engaged,
separately, in hunting, gathering and hiding eggs
under an-old tub, in the woodpile, ditch, goose-berry
bushes, etc. If we found someone else's
cache it became ours. The one to bring in the 
most eggs at coloring time got.a prize - it was as
exciting as hiding Christmas presents. We didn't
know about the 'Easter Bunny' then. I remember
catching toads and getting warts (disproved now);
I remember the entire family being mustered 
together with dishtowels and papers to shoo flies
out of the screen doors; I can still smell the glue
on the fly paper which hung from ceilings and
doors, where black, shiny wings buzzed and spindle
legs tugged to get free; I hear again the seething,
droning mass of fly bodies in the wire catcher outside. 
I recall throwing Virginia's shoe out in the
rain and being sent to get it. Just as I stooped to 
retrieve it, lightning forked and thunder broke and
I fell flat in a puddle of mud. The resultant fear
of electric storms lasted until I pretended calmness
for the sake of my own children.

"Other happenings creep along the edge of
memory as I write - the day the house caught fire,
starting and ending in the attic; the old stove-heated
flat iron scorching the window sill where someone
had set it to cool; the rocks heated and wrapped in
paper to warm our icy beds in winter; the making
of paper flowers for Decoration Day (mother
prefered wild flowers from the hills); the sweet
<span id="page-731"></span>
gravy-taste of lumpydick; the pinpoint, dark eyes
of our baby tender who chanted, 'Hark, hark! The
dogs do bark; the beggars are coming to town....'
to bring us into meek submission; the dancing of
a row of paper dolls made from folded newspapers.

"I enjoyed a great feeling of love, security
and family solidarity in that old home, so it was
with a deep sense of loss that I left it to move with
the family to Mabey's house across the road west
from the school until our new home on Depot Street
was finished. It was here in the summer of 1910
that I contracted a mild case of scarlet fever and
was quarantined, along with mother, in Grandpa
and Aunt Lydia's stuffy parlor with its upholstered
furniture, gilt framed pictures, stiff lace curtains
and marble fireplace. I was happy when I was
transfered to the sitting room where the organ
was. I played school with marbles as pupils and
empty thread spools as desks, while mother wrote.
Sometimes, if I would lie still on the bed, she'd
sing in her sweet contralto voice a sad song about
an Indian maiden, which I shall always 
love - 'Fallen Leaf'.

"In October of 1910 we moved into our new
house via a long stepladder through the upstairs
Blue Room window, since our lovely stairway was
being varnished. I longed for the old home one
half block away but I soon found even greater
happiness here with inside plumbing, clinking 
radiators, and a fireplace around which the 
family gathered while Daddy peeled apples and
mother read stories to us. The church had no 
need to institute'Home Evenings' for us then as
ours were constant, complete, and gratefully now,
remembered.

"There was always so much to do. around our
new place in summers. Our big garden was fun
to play Pioneer in; our barn made good jumping
from the loft into the hay; the long, knotted rope 
hanging from the apricot tree back of the house
was sheer joy to swing on. For playing Statue,
Prisoner's Base, and Steal-Sticks, our big west 
lawn couldn't be beat, or to lie on to watch 
cloud-pictures in the sky. The shade of the weeping
willow tree was wonderful to sit in while mother
<span id="page-732"></span>
read to us on summer afternoons. During many
dusk-drawn evenings our family took supper to the
fields, ran races through the clover, waded barefoot 
in the streams and gathered pretty pebbles
from the riverbed; or while listening to the sighing
winds and twittering birds in the cottonwood trees,
watch the day slowly die in the west.

"During other evenings the children of the
neighborhood met under the street light on the
corner to play Kick-the-Can or Run-Sheep-Run.
There were other fun things I remember, like
dressing up cats and playing house with them;
playing postoffice using loose rocks in Horning's
old rock wall to put our letters under; making
honey and taffy candy; taking trips to Temple Hill
and Devils Ribs; having corn roasts at the Green
canal; swimming in the muddy, carpy Sanpitch
River; watching the 'pig-man' kill pigs through a
knothole in Alder's back fence; waiting for Mr.
Harmon's train-hack so we could jump on back and
take a ride, and playing show in Felt's barn. I
don't remember the name of those shows but I do
remember some of the lines - 'Zeek, Zeek, long-
legged Zeek. Your head is all right but you've got
such big feet'.

"I remember special celebrations - the
Fourth of July. On the eve of the Third we laid out
our embroidered dresses, ribbon sashes, new
shoes, stockings and petticoats - all ready for the
morning salute of the guns to be up and about the
fun of the day. The band, transported on a hayrack,
serenaded the town dignitaries and always
included our place. Then came the parade which
ended in front of the Tabernacle where the patriotic
meeting followed. The place was draped with
bunting and everybody crowded into hear, year
after year, the singing of 'The Flag Without a
Stain' and the dramatic reading of 'Ring, Grandpa,
Ring; O Ring for Liberty!' My heart swelled with
a great love for my country - would that I could
recapture more often the depths of that feeling
now! The fear of lighted firecrackers being
thrown under our feet has almost been forgotten
in the remembrance of the joy of those celebrations.
The matinee dance at Felt's Opera House (in later
<span id="page-733"></span>
years at the Armory) and fireworks at our place
afterwards completed the long, satisfying day.
The Twenty-Fourth always seemed quite anti-climatic,
except that I associated it with Christensen 
family reunions held on Grandfather
Christensen's birthday, July twenty-second and
often extending to the Twenty-Fourth.

"I don't remember too much emphasis being
placed on our church going although we were
encouraged to attend Sunday School. I don't
remember our parents going with us but they must
have gone to church in the afternoons. My baptism
into the church, which took place 5 Sep. 1911
in the Manti Temple, came after almost a year of
procrastination. Quince Crawford baptized me at
that time and Niels Anderson confirmed me. I
recall going to Mutual occasionally on Sunday
evenings and that Virginia and I sang in the Ward
choir when we were quite young. Perhaps I was
the one who didn't go to church much, but I had
the same childlike faith in my Heavenly Father
that I did in Santa Claus and my earthly father. I
was somewhat in awe of the first two but I wanted
to do the things that would please each. I knew
that each had unquestioned powers to grant the
desires of people who believed. Through the years,
I think I can count the times on the fingers of one
hand that I haven't knelt in nightly petition. The
last words we heard after kissing our parents.
'goodnight' were, "Good night - hope you sleep 
well - don't forget to say your prayers." Hell
was a very real and burning place to me with all
the everlasting tortures of old world beliefs, but 
I had faith that prayer would keep me out of it. 

"When mother was so ill and I heard doubts
of her living, I went about my days smugly, knowing 
that I had prayed with all my heart that God
would heal her and I was sure he would, as he
answered the prayers of faithful children. When
I heard the news of her death, I felt lost and
cheated and began to question a Father who promised 
one thing and gave another. I was in Heber
City at the time, staying at Aunt Retta's home. I
can still feel against my bare legs the rough boards
of the box in the chicken coop where I sat most of
<span id="page-734"></span>
the day, grieving over my lost mother and my lost
faith. Sometime before that I had learned about
Santa, too. I was sure mother knew my feelings
as she seemed so close to me after she'd gone.

"Many times, remembering mother, I'd cry.
Perhaps, besides missing her, I recalled the times
I'd stood on the rockers when she was trying to
rock the baby and wouldn't move at her first gentle
request; or when she'd asked a favor I'd been
stubborn about it and she'd tell me that I'd be sorry
some day and I'd say I didn't care. She'd look at
me thoughtfully and say, 'Well, little daughter,
when I'm no longer here then you'll care.' I
hadn't talked things over with mother like Virginia
had, but after she'd gone I told her through my
tears of my secret longings and my love for her.
Since then I've always felt her nearness and closeness
and she's been to me an ever-present buffer
between my rebellious nature and temptation.

"Perhaps I could have been taught by my
parents to work harder and to more purpose but
they seemed to want us children to be carefree
and happy, and we were. Dad was a lawyer, County
Attorney, and finally Judge of the Seventh Judicial
District. We were comfortably situated in one of
the nicest homes in town, had one of the first
Buicks, and owned farms, sheep, cattle and
horses. In 1915 Virginia and I went with our
parents to the Worlds Fair at San Francisco,
Calif. and the overflow of it at San Diego, Calif.
A few days ago, when I saw a news reel on T. V.
describing the renovation of some of the buildings
of that Fair, I recognized some of them and began
to recall some of my experiences at the Fair. I
remembered my insistence on wearing my new
Girl Scout uniform the entire trip; the little
electric one-seated carts guided by a hand bar
that we used for transportation at the Fair; the
flocks of pigeons that flew around and above us
dangerously; the lighthouse we visited and the
baby crab I picked up on the beach and hid in
Dad's suitcase, much to the consternation of the
hotel manager a few days later when he was
called in to investigate the sickening odor of decay
that emanated from the closet in our room. He
<span id="page-735"></span>
found the cause and Dad found the culprit - ugh
and ouch!

"I have always liked school from the time I
entered kindergarten at the age of almost six years.
My first teacher was Miss Cox, who was keeping
company at the time with my Uncle Joseph Snow.
When he dropped in sometimes to visit, I loved to
sit on his lap to impress my teacher and schoolmates. 
My favorite teachers in the upper grades
were Emery G. Epperson, Andrew Judd, Elmer
Peterson and of course, Ellis Johnson who did so
much to stimulate my love of fine music.

"My high school training was a bit sketchy.
I attended one year at Manti High and one year and
two quarters at the B. Y. High in Provo, Utah,
where Virginia and I boarded with Mr. & Mrs.
Oscar Hyde. After a six weeks summer school at
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where I
boarded with Aunt Retta Neff, I entered as a freshman
at B.Y.U. in Provo, In the spring of 1925,
after one years teaching at Manti High and Junior
High schools in between, I graduated from B.Y.U.
with high honors. The following summer I went
with B. Y. U. coach Eugene Roberts, Chick Hart,
Wilma Jeppson and Mildred Lewis to the University
at Madison, Wisconsin, where I took speech
and physical education preparatory to teaching in
the Lehi High School in Utah County. I have taken
summer school classes, extension and correspondence 
classes numerous times since then, until
I now have the equivalent of a Masters Degree.

"My teaching experience has beena very
satisfying one to me. Aside from the year 1923/24
when I taught music, reading and drama in the
Manti Junior and Senior High Schools. I taught in
Lehi from 1925-1937, teaching speech, U. S.
History and Physical Education in the High School.
From 1937 to 1949 I taught music, physical education
and English in the Junior High School at Cedar
City, Utah, where my husband, Edward Webb
Southwick, had moved to work as Office Manager
for Bradshaw Chevrolet Company. In 1955 I joined
the C. S. U. faculty in Cedar City as teacher of
basic communications. My duties and time
increased until I was soon teaching three-fourths
<span id="page-736"></span>
time and acting as girls activity counselor. In
1961 I became an assistant professor and added
the duties of Dean of Women to my load. I
terminated my teaching at C. S. U. the spring
of 1963 except for a summer class each year in
children's literature and an occasional night class.
This year 1968/69, however, I have been teaching
again full time at the College but haven't decided
whether to continue longer or not. Ted and I have
recently moved into a lovely new home and I should
like to be able to enjoy it.

"Regardless of my teaching I have been quite
active in church. I taught Primary in the Manti
Center Ward the year 1923/24; in the Salt Lake
Eighteenth Ward 1934-1936, where I was also
teacher trainer; had charge of drama one year
each in the Twentieth and Belvedere Wards. I
served in the MIA presidency in the Eighteenth
Ward and taught the Social Science lessons in the
Belvedere Ward between the years 1933-1936. In
Cedar City I taught the Silver and Golden Gleaners
in the College or Eighth Wards; was on the MIA
Stake Board for several years before Cedar Stake
was divided from Parawan Stake and was on the
Relief Society Stake Board for about five years.
I led the Singing Mothers for many years and
helped to produce two Stake pageants. I served
as Literary leader for four or five years as well
as being director of the Singing Mothers. I was
on the Genealogical Society Stake Board of Cedar
West Stake for two years, first secretary of the
Cedar City Genealogical and Historical Society,
taught a class in home records in Sunday School,
did research for hundreds of names on our Mathis
and Southwick lines, as well as doing the temple
work for about two hundred of these kindred dead
over the last years. I was a 100% Relief Society
Visiting Teacher for five years. I am grateful
for these church opportunities for I know that it is
through activity that one's testimony grows.

'My music career has been a hit and miss
affair. Mother always sang at her work and taught
Virginia and me to sing and love music. She and
Father showed great interest in the cultural affairs
of the community. When I was about eleven years
<span id="page-737"></span>
old Father bought a lovely Baldwin piano, which
my son Richard has now. Until marriage separated
us, Virginia and I played and sang duets and put on
numerous skits for programs. I had to be prodded
to keep at my piano practicing, but did manage to
play in several recitals. The first I remember
was when I played 'Scarf Dance'; Virginia played
a violin solo. The last was on Aug. 25, 1918 when
I played 'Rustle of Spring'. I could play for hours
to amuse myself, entertain others and accompany
some. In 1935 I went on Fred Graham's Lyceum
Bureau program tour as a reader and as an accompanist
for Lowell Hicks, Marimbaphonist.

"Singing was more to my liking. Florence
Jepperson Madsen gave Virginia and me private
lessons for several years while we were at school
in Provo. She offered us many opportunities in
choruses, operas, duets and solos. Years later
I took from Richard Condie when I joined the Salt
Lake Tabernacle Choir as alto No. 29. While
teaching music in Cedar Junior and Senior High,
I wrote and directed my own opera, I have always
been a member of some musical group and for
several years sang the contralto solos in Handel's
Messiah, both in Cedar City at Christmas time and
in Zion's Park Easter pageants.  Ihave had three
songs published; one, The Lions Roar', has been
the official Cedar City Lion's Club song since
about 1940. Many unpublished ones are gathering
dust in my piano bench.

"Drama! Ah, there was my heart. Secluded
in the Blue Room in Manti when I was young, I
could be anyone I wanted to be, as my mirror
could testify since I emoted in front of it through
many dramatic experiences. I took part in most
of the plays and operettas in public school. In
Sixth Grade, how I loved 'A Dream of Fairyland'.
I would have liked to be dressed in tinsel and
gauze as Virginia and the rest of the good fairies
were, but I was better suited as a leader of the
bad elfin band, trying to coax two little children
to go astray.

"In college I took leads in quite a few
productions: Priscilla, Great Divide, Old Lady 31,
The Country Boy, The Gondaliers, and others. I
<span id="page-738"></span>
was a charter member of Mask Club and Theta
Alpha Phi at Provo. I coached two college plays,
also one opera, and assisted with the coaching of
Sazy for the Provo Stake Relief Society, which we
repeated later in the old Salt Lake Theatre. I
played one of the leads in a Salt Lake Stake play
presented at the Ralph Cloniger Theatre. I was
also the lead in two MIA contest plays which won
the church finals: Tombs and In Secret Places,
where I played opposite Gordon Owen. In Cedar
City I have played leads in Anastasia, Women Have
Dominion, The Glass Managerie, Arsenic and Old
Lace, and I Remember Mama, which we repeated
fourteen times. I have given many play readings
and solo poetry recitals. There have been so many
opportunities for me and until the last few years
I've had great difficulty saying 'no'.

"Each year, besides my assigned duties, I
try to take a group of ladies and teach them how
to read and enjoy poetry, or I teach a class in
poetry writing. I have many other delightful
hobbies besides those already mentioned - tatting,
knitting, quilting, oil painting, golfing, writing
poetry, talking, playing Five Hundred, Sluff and
Bridge, and traveling. Our family has been from
coast to coast and border to border and to Canada
and Mexico. Besides exploring the scenic wonders
of our own country, my husband and I have each
been to Europe twice and to Hawaii.

"Since Ted and I were married in the Salt.
Lake Temple in 1927 (May 25) by David O. McKay,
we have had a hill and valley life together - varied
enough to remain interesting and satisfying. As it
is in any geological time, the parks and mountains
flatten out and form peaceful valleys - so it is with
our marriage. We have four wonderful children
and fifteen remarkable grandchildren. My patriarchal
blessing says: 'One of the objects of this
life is to be the mother of a noble race of men'.
I'm sure my one lovely daughter is included in
this. If I can be judged by the accomplishments
of my children I know I have done well. Yet I
know that I have left much good undone and have
undone much good by impulsive actions.

"As yet, I don't feel too comfortable
<span id="page-739"></span>
vegetating in a rocker; rather I would have my days
continue with health, purpose and diverse conflicts
and contrasts that will keep me searching, experiencing, 
relenting and accomplishing. I would be
about my many yet unlearned lessons. I'm looking
forward to the day when, either from my rocker
or my eternal mansion, when my children can
forget my failings and weaknesses and can bring
to pass the promise given to me in a comfort
blessing by Brother Joseph A. Cornwall in 1932,
in which he said: 'Your children will grow up and
honor and bless your memory. They will be proud
in time to claim that they are called of your name.
They will proclaim to the world in beautiful terms
your service to them, your comfort to them, your
blessing to them, and your desires of them for
their good in the earth."

Edward Webb Southwick, "Ted" was born 15
June 1899 in Lehi, Utah, the son of Edward and
Rachel Ann Webb Southwick. For many years now
he has had his own tax company in Cedar City and
doesn't plan to retire. He is enthusiastic about
golf and plays a good game. He is also a great
sports fan and follows the football and basketball
conferences either in person or on TV and radio.
He keeps up a regular correspondence with his
children and travels to visit them often, in 
conjunction with Elaine.

## Louis Lucien Christensen 

(17) Louis Lucien Christensen (7) was born
20 Aug. 1903 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the old
Wasden home across the road west and a bit south
from the rock house owned by his Christensen grandparents.
His grandmother, Else K., likely served
as midwife on that occasion.

Lucien wasn't much more than a toddler when
his family moved a mile or so west of Gunnison to
live on a ranch owned by his father's brother, Albert.
<span id="page-741"></span>
The skeleton of the small log and lumber farmhouse
they lived in then is still standing (1969) on what is
now the Ray Taylor ranch. Lucien and his sister
LaFaun, two years older, were great pals. There
was no one else to play with on the ranch except
their baby brother Rex, who was sickly. Sometimes 
they got lonesome. LaFaun tells about
Lucien and herself running away from the ranch
one day and walking all the way to Gunnison before
they were "apprehended".

Lucien was baptized a member of the LDS
church 5 Sep. 1911 in the beautiful Manti Temple,
a privilege made possible at that time to children
who turned eight in Sanpete Valley. Not very many
children of the church had the opportunity of having
their baptism in a temple. Soon other places were
provided for those of Sanpete Valley also.

Lucien remembers, while a boy in Gunnison,
of driving up to Manti to visit his Danish grandparents
quite often, along with the rest of his
family. In the wintertime they would heat large
rocks to put under the quilts that covered them in
the buggy, to keep their feet warm. He says he
always looked forward to those trips with great
anticipation and happiness.

His father was away from home with the
sheep so much of the time, both winters and summers, 
but when he was home they had such good
times together. He remembers well the many
trips he and his father took together in the mountains
in the Gunnison area and later in Wyoming.
They would travel all day in the mountains, catch
fish for dinner and camp all night. He really
enjoyed those trips as a boy. He has always
enjoyed fishing, hunting and horseback riding,
ever since he was a small lad.

Lucien was only a few months past five years
old when his father bought his grandparents' rock
house on the corner of Second West and First North
in Gunnison. This house is still standing and now
owned by Ella Knighton Hansen. Lucien visited
that home this past year (1968) for the first time
in fifty-two years. He also visited the home in
Mayfield, Utah where his father was born in 1880,
<span id="page-742"></span>
which is still standing and in use, and he visited
his Christensen grandparents' graves in the Manti
Cemetery, which is overlooked by the beautiful
Manti Temple where he was baptized.

It was from the rock house in Gunnison that
Lucien first started school the fall of 1909. He
attended the public school there until he was just
past twelve-and-a-half, when his family left Gunnison
and moved to a ranch not many miles from
Lyman, Wyoming, where his father had taken up
a homestead. On 27 Mar. 1916 the Louis D.
Christensen family, together with Aunt Elsie
Bartholomew and her five children, left Gunnison
by train headed for Wyoming. They had all slept
the night before at Aunt Emma and Uncle Charlie
Peterson's place, who lived about a mile from the
Gunnison depot. There were six children in the
Christensen family at the time: LaFaun 14, Lucien
12&frac12;, Rex 10, Dale about 6&frac12;, Weldon just turned 4,
and baby Alice nearly 2.

Reaching Lyman, Wyoming the group were
taken to the ranch they called "The Oasis" some
few miles east of Lyman. They all lived for some
weeks in two rooms of the four-roomed ranch cabin
belonging to their father's brother Chris, until
homes could be built, one on each place that Louis
and his sister Elsie had homesteaded. LaFaun
remembers that until then they were so crowded
that some even had to sleep on top of the big table
and some under. Cousin Edith Bartholomew
remembers that she was always hungry then - there
never did seem to be enough food to satisfy
them all.

Two summers living on The Oasis followed
for Lucien and the others, during which time "firebugs"
tried to drive them out, destroying one home
built by his father and, after several attempts,
burning down the other which replaced the first.
The year's crops of his Uncle Chris were destroyed
by fire, his Uncle Chris killed. They were forced
to guard what they had on the ranch with guns.
Details of this period have been given in earlier
chapters of the book. 

The families moved into Lyman in winters
<span id="page-743"></span>
so the children could attend school. Lucien
finished the grades in Lyman. He says, "I could
hardly wait for school to let out each spring so
that I could spend the summer on our ranch east
of Lyman. I will never forget the good times I
had there - nor the heartaches!"

His father became sheriff of Uinta County,
Wyoming and the family moved to Evanston, the
county seat. Here Lucien attended High School.
He says he played a little basketball and football
there but wasn't too good at either. Always a
modest fellow and rather quiet, we could expect
him to say that. Although he is a bit above average
in height, he has never been husky; quite to the
contrary, which might have accounted for any lack
of success he may have felt he had in football.

After graduation from High School Lucien
took a job as ticket clerk for the railroad in
Evanston. In 1925, when the family moved to
Cheyenne, Wyoming, for a time he transferred
to Cheyenne and went to work for the railroad
there, serving in many different capacities for
that organization, During the depression of the 
1930s he was laid off from the railroad for a year,
during which time he went to Ogden, Utah, and
lived with his sister LaFaun and family for a
while and then spent the winter at a C C camp
near Los Angeles, Calif, which he says he
enjoyed. It was a change from railroading. He
was active in the church in Cheyenne, serving as
Assistant LDS Ward Clerk for several years.

He was nearing thirty-two years of age when
he finally married. He and Dora Edith Thompson
were wed in Ogden, Utah, 4 June 1935. They
made their home in Cheyenne where two sons were
born to them: Louis Lucien Jr. and Robert James,
whom they called Jim. But things didn't go well
with Lucien and Dora and they were divorced.
About ten years later Lucien married a divorcee
with three young children, Mrs. Marie Victoria
Nelson Hickey. He did not adopt these children
but he practically raised them. He and their
mother lived together many years until these 
step-children of his were grown. But their later 
married.years were unpleasant ones, especially for
<span id="page-744"></span>
Lucien, and they were finally divorced.

Not long afterwards he retired from the railroad
because of poor health. He had become very
nervous. He worked his last day in Cheyenne 7
July 1965. Cousin Byron Peterson says that
Lucien worked thirty-seven years without missing
a pay check - this is entirely possible. It is a
long time to have one's "nose to the grindstone".
He moved immediately to Salt Lake City and
secured his own apartment. His retirement pension 
plus a lifetime pass on the railroad makes it
possible for him to enjoy life with little financial
worry, since he lives modestly. He lives alone
and, besides traveling quite often to visit relatives,
he attends dances and other Senior Citizen activities. 
He loves social dancing and is a good dancing
partner.

But Lucien's main hobbies today are his two
tall and hdndsome sons, each pushing about six
feet three inches. Both are doing very well, Jim
in real estate in the Walnut Creek, California area
and Louis Jr. as General Manager of the large
Woolco Department Store in Phoenix, Arizona.
He spends quite a bit of time with these boys and
their families, visiting each about three times a
year.

His two sons (and their families) by his first
wife, Dora Edith Thompson (div.) both born in
Cheyenne, Uinta, Wyoming are:

1. Louis Lucien Christensen Jr., born 8 Feb.
1936; md. 16 June 1956 in Walnut Creek, California,
Carolyn Lola Smith (b. 14 June 1936,
Tucson, Arizona to Mr. & Mrs. Hubert P.
Smith). Children:

    1. Sherlyn Lou Christensen, b. 7 Apr. 1957,
Walnut Creek, Calif.

    1. Kathryn Sue Christensen, b. 8 Sept. 1958,
Walnut Creek.

    1. Louis Barton Christensen, b. 6 May 1963,
Monrovia, Calif.

1. Robert James Christensen, born 1 Dec. 1937;
md. 21 Nov. 1959 in Reno, Nevada, Rayma
Antoinette, or "Toni" Kinnee (b. 26 Oct. 1938
Yuba City, Calif., to Lloyd B. and Patricia
<span id="page-745"></span>
Helene Peet Kinnee). They have no children
at present.

## Edgar Dee Bartholomew 

(18) Edgar Dee Bartholomew (5) was born
21 Aug. 1903 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. His
mother wrote a history of him and placed it in
her Book of Remembrance from which we quote:

"Edgar was blessed by his paternal grandfather, 
Bishop John Bartholomew, 4 Oct. 1903 in
the red stone church in Fayette. His grandmother
Christensen took him to the Manti Temple 5 Sep.
1911 where he was baptized a member of the LDS
church by Quincy G. Crawford and confirmed the
same day and place by Nils O. Anderson Jr. He
was ordained a Deacon in Gunnison, Utah 7 Nov.
1915 by Adolph Peterson.

"Edgar's family moved from Fayette to
Gunnison the spring of 1907, when he was nearly
four. His father bought a fine red brick house
there from Lafe Bown. Edgar started grade
school in Gunnison, beginning in the fall of 1909
when he was six and continuing each school year
until the spring of 1916 when he was going on thirteen.
The red brick house was sold to his Uncle
Arthur Christensen and he and his mother and
brothers and sisters moved into Uncle Arthur's
old house in southwest Gunnison, once owned by
Uncle Chris. This was in the late fall of 1915.

"On 27 Mar. 1916 Edgar, together with his
mother and brothers and sisters and also his
Uncle Louis Christensen's family left Gunnison
by train for Lyman, Wyoming, from where they
moved onto a homestead about six miles east of
Lyman, which had been taken up by their mother.
Here the family lived and worked in summers and
moved to Lyman in winters where the children
could attend school. Edgar must have finished
grade school there. 

"In the spring of 1918 his family moved to
Ogden, Utah, where his father had bought a nice
new home in the Fourth Ward. Edgar attended
school that winter in Ogden. He was ordained a
Teacher in the LDS priesthood 1 Apr. 1919 by
<span id="page-746"></span>
Hyrum E. Lund. The family moved back to Lyman,
Wyoming that spring and lived for another year.
Edgar again attended school in Lyman.

"The spring of 1920 his family moved to
Goshen, Utah, on the Robert Boswell farm.
Edgar helped his father on the farm. He loved
to ride horses and became very proficient in that,
soon taking part in rodeos. He was also interested
in electrical work. He got a job with the Phoenix
utility line, working from Santaquin to Eureka
under Superintendent Whipple, and enjoying the
work continued in that occupation.

"In 1928 he worked in Chicago, Illinois and
then in northern Texas for Texas Power and Light
Company. Then he worked in Merida, Yucatan and
then in Mexico for awhile, returning to Utah in
September 1930. He started work for the Tintic
Standard Mining Co. at Dividend, Utah, and worked
there during 1934/35. In 1936 he went east and
worked in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. During
World War II he worked in the shipyards. From
there he went to Louisiana and Mississippi, working
for Stone and Webster Electrical Co. He then
went to work for an electrical company in Alabama,
Mississippi and Tennessee, from where he was
called to Little Rock, Arkansas to supervise some
electrical construction lines going out of that area.

"1 May 1953 Edgar returned to Utah and went
to Moab and worked in the uranium business until
Jan. 1954 when he went to Salt Lake City to have
surgery for the removal of a cataract from his
right eye, by Drs. Palmer and Quinn. (During his
recovery his father passed away, 6 Mar. 1954.)
After two months rest he returned to work at
Moab but had to quit again for surgery on his left
eye. A cataract was removed from that eye 11 Jan.
1956 by the same doctors who took care of the right
eye. Both eye operations were successful. While
recovering from the second he had some improvements
made at the family home in Payson, where
he lived with his mother whenever he was in the
area - a new gas furnace and water heater and an
Admiral color TV installed. When fully recovered,
Edgar returned to Moab where he was interested in
some uranium claims, returning to Payson from
<span id="page-747"></span>
time to time to look after the needs and interests
of his mother."

Following the death of his mother in June
1964, and after the family home was sold, Edgar
returned to Moab, Utah to make his permanent
home. During 1966 he built himself a large boat
to sail on the Green River there. He also owns a
large trailer house in which he lives, and some
uranium claims. He enjoys life, working his 
claims, prospecting, fishing, boating, and has
become a typical "rock hound". He is unmarried
at the present time (1969) and has no descendants.

## Wendell Bartholomew Christensen 

(19) Wendell Bartholomew Christensen (2) sent his interesting history in installments, we could hardly wait for the next mail. Here it is: "I was born 26 Oct. 1903 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah in the same house my mother, Sarah, had been born twenty-eight years before. Descendants of the builder, my grandfather John Bartholomew, still occupy the place.

"One of my earliest recollections was a trip to Europe at age six-and-a-half. Father took a leave of absence from his school work in Salt Lake City to study in England, France and Germany, and took the whole family along. I started school at Leipzig, Germany and soon felt at home with the German children. When we returned to America in 1911 we settled in Provo, Utah, where Father was appointed head of the Language and Archeological depts. at BYU. Edythe and I were placed in the BYU Training School. Here I was baptized a member of the church, 21 June 1912, by Willard F. Russell and confirmed the same day by Reed Beck.

"From Provo we moved to Rexburg, Idaho, where father had been appointed President of Ricks Junior College. Here I first received the priesthood, being ordained 26 Nov. 1916 by L.T. Perry. I also received a patriarchal blessing which has been a great source of encouragement and guidance all my life. From Idaho we moved to LaVerkin in Utah's 'Dixie' where we spent some eventful years developing a hot springs resort and trying to start <span id="page-748"></span>an irrigation project to water several thousand acres of what could have been wonderfully productive land. It failed at that time but was just recently approved by the U.S. Government after a wait of about fifty years.

"From Dixie we moved to Hinkley, Utah, where Father answered a call by the church to organize the Millard Academy into a junior college. About this time the church decided to abandon the church school system with the exception of BYU and Weber and LDS Colleges. So father left the teaching profession for business and ranching. He acquired the Star Ranch with his brother Albert and brother-in-law Otis Ursenbrach and later bought a cattle ranch near Duchesne, Utah. My days as a ranch hand and farmer lasted until the farm depression in 1923 when financial reverses caused the loss of the ranches and the family moved to Salt Lake, where father went into business promoting his various mining and metals interests and we older children got jobs. I spent several years in mining, first in Farmington, Utah, and later in California.

"It was while living in Salt Lake and going to school at the U of U that I first met Ann Howells, a popular member of our Ward's younger set. We were in an MIA play together and our friendship blossomed into love. I was called on a mission to Germany in 1925 and after my farewell party in the Ward, I sat on the church porch with Ann while the church almost burned down. A thief had broken into the chapel hoping to find the money donated for my mission expenses and had dropped a match which started the blaze. Ann and I corresponded while I was in Germany and shortly after my return we became engaged.

"My mission in Germany was a wonderful experience. Because of my earlier trip there I learned the language easily and was blessed with some fine missionary companions. I labored first in Dresden, a beautiful city rich in tradition and
culture, where I met many faithful, warm and friendly people and learned to love them like my own family. Later I was sent to Breslau as District President and it was here that I had a <span id="page-749"></span>remarkable experience. The mission president had called a conference for the whole mission, to be held in Dresden, a distance of about three hundred and twelve miles from Breslau. It was suggested that the Elders from each District walk the whole distance and tract and preach the gospel on the way. We were all excited at the prospects, but two weeks before the conference it started to rain and rain and rain without let up. All over Germany the crops were being ruined and things were developing into a national emergency. The mission president sent word that we should give up the idea of walking unless things changed well in advance of the date. Those in our District met together, prayed and discussed the problem, deciding that if the Lord wanted us to do his work the way would be opened. We also decided that we would fast the day before our departure, then meet the next day for our final prayers and take our separate courses two by two. There were sixteen of us, making eight different groups.

"When the final morning arrived it was raining hard and the skies were leaden; the papers predicted more rain. Undaunted, we met at the appointed place with our knapsacks filled with gospel tracts, heavy soles on our shoes, and prepared to depend on the hospitality of the German people during our three hundred mile walking tour. We sang a song and prayed together, asking the Lord to clear the skies. A few words of encouragement were given and we went downstairs and out
into the street. The rain had stopped and patches of blue sky appeared among the clouds. For two weeks we walked under warm, blue skies and were welcomed by farmers and villagers who had been thoroughly humbled by prospects of lost crops. As one hundred sixty footsore missionaries arrived in Dresden to commence a three day conference and testimony meetings the skies suddenly darkened and it began to rain again. I have never heard more wonderful testimonies than those given by these Elders relating their experiences - some really miraculous. Meetings lasting ten hours each passed without notice; we wondered where the time went. Sheldon had been called to Germany on a mission a year after I left and I had <span id="page-750"></span>the privilege of being his first district president.

"When I returned home our family was having financial problems. Finances for both Sheldon and my missions had been mostly earned by mother from sewing burial clothes in partnership with another sister of the Ward. Her sacrifices and labor will always be remembered with gratitude and love. This was March 1928 and I left shortly after for Los Angeles, Calif. to help father with his mining projects. These ventures were not successful and in June 1929 I returned to Salt Lake to marry Ann and then moved with her back to Los Angeles, where we began keeping house in a small apartment on Portland street.

"I was unable to support a wife working for Father and soon set out on my own. I got a job selling Christmas cards until the holidays ended and then tried selling real estate. I did fairly well but was unhappy with the people for whom I worked and finally got a job with the Standard Oil Company as a fireman at their El Segundo plant. I remained with Standard Oil for most of a year, receiving some promotion and saving some money, but the depression of 1929-1933 had already hurt the oil business and Standard suddenly laid off 2500 men, including myself. By searching the papers I found a selling job with the Club Aluminum Co. demonstrating and selling cooking utensils.

"I began to realize that I was not paying my tithing. Money from commissions came in a few dollars at a time and was spent as it was received. I placed a small canvas banksack in the pocket of the car and if I earned ten dollars, one dollar went into the sack. At the end of the week I would pay the money to the Bishop. From that time forward we began to prosper and receive guidance and blessings. All during the depression years we had work and an income.

"I was called to be Superintendent of the Wilshire Ward Sunday School, which at the time was the largest Ward in the church, with over 3200 members. After a year I was called into the office of President Cannon of the Los Angeles Stake and told that I had been chosen as Bishop of the Santa <span id="page-751"></span>Monica Ward. I had just turned thirty-one, had never seen the Santa Monica Ward and did not know any of the people. When I told my wife she thought it was a joke. However, we accepted the call and moved to Santa Monica. I served for a month without selecting my assistants in order to become better acquainted with the people, but finally made my selection of Counselors and, by special per-
mission, chose one of the sisters as Ward Clerk. It was a fine experience and we made many wonderful and lasting friends. One of my first official acts as Bishop was to perform the marriage ceremony for my brother Luther and his sweetheart Velda Peterson.

"In 1936 my company transfered me to Long Beach as branch manager of the office but I continued to serve as Bishop in Santa Monica for almost a year after, traveling back and forth for all meetings, rain or shine. We carried our baby,
Bart, in the car with us and he was always smiles day or night. I was finally released and then called as counselor to Bishop Henry Carlson of the Pine View Ward in Long Beach, where I served until we returned to Los Angeles in 1939. I had just been made the regional manager of the Century Metalcraft Corporation over all of southern California. I gained a strong testimony of the way the Lord blesses us if we try to serve him. I had been told many times by my boss that if I would only spend less time in church work and use Sundays for making sales I would go far with the company. However, he was made vice-president of the company and transferred to Chicago and I was given his job in Los Angeles and we became one of the leading offices in the country with more than one hundred salesmen. When the Second World War started President Roosevelt issued a direction withdrawing all metals from private business use, except by special priority. Our business, being what was considered a non-essential industry, was soon doomed. I bought and stored all the aluminum cooking utensils I could from the factory in Los Angeles, but after six months of hopeful struggle we had to announce to our sales force that the end had come and to look for other work in the defense plants. <span id="page-752"></span>

"By this time I had a wife and two growing sons and we were soon blessed with twin daughters. I felt that I must now find a business that could not be damaged by changing conditions. I decided to apply to the Occidental Life Insurance Company where my brother Sheldon was then employed. This was in November 1942. I was accepted and soon trained and under way; the choice turned out to be a wise and profitable one. Early in 1944 my manager was sent to San Francisco as branch manager there and soon wrote and asked me to come north to be his assistant. Ann and I went to the Bay City to look things over and were impressed, so I accepted.

"I moved to San Francisco first, intending to find a place for my family, but every available place was reserved for war workers. We were invited to live with first one family of friends and then another, until I finally got permission from the government to build a house, and the Occidental Life Insurance Company agreed to advance the needed money to purchase a lot and needed materials. Ann and the children were sent to Salt Lake City to live with her mother, now a widow, while the house was under construction. It was expected to be finished within sixty to ninety days, but because of the war and difficulty in getting materials, it took more than nine months. This was a period of strain, especially for Ann, but finally the house was finished in time for us to move in for Thanksgiving 1946. It was a real Thanksgiving for us. We were together again and in a home of our own, and our business was prospering. The Lord had
been very kind and blessed us abundantly.

"The year before, 1945, my boss had decided to move back to Los Angeles and, after some discussion at the home office, I was given his position in San Francisco. At first I was placed on salary with the title of "Acting Manager" but after one year was given the full title of Branch Manager and an overwriting on all the business produced by the office. We prospered and built the business to a production of over $20,000,000 per year. Yes, we were blessed in many ways!

"I was called to be the Stake Superintendent <span id="page-753"></span>of the Sunday School in the newly created Palo Alto Stake and then, after a year, as second counselor to Stake President Claud B. Peterson. About a year later he was called to Salt Lake to be secretary to the Quorum of the Twelve. His first counselor was made Stake President and I became first counselor. When the new Stake President, Brother Henry Jorgenson, was sent to Florida to head the
church Welfare farm there, I was set apart as Stake President of Palo Alto Stake by Elder Stephen L. Richards, 30 Apr. 1950.

"I was released as stake president in 1953 and shortly thereafter left Occidental Life to go into business for myself. I took a general agency with Beneficial Standard Life Insurance Co. of Los Angeles, and in 1956 made an additional connection with Financial Fund of Denver, Colorado.  Since then I have continued in the business of estate programming, using life insurance and mutual funds, increasing our operational scope and adding and training new salesmen. We changed our dealer connection from Financial Industrial Fund to Kelly and Morey, Inc. of Denver in Feb. 1966. In May 1967 we merged with the Equity Funding Corporation of Los Angeles, and I became vice president and Divisional Sales Manager of the San Francisco area.

"I have known the healing power of the priesthood. In 1948 when we were landscaping our backyard I was operating a rototiller, a powerful machine with a series of spring steel hooks which rotated under a heavy steel cover. In attempting
to turn a corner I put one foot forward to brace myself and one of the hooks caught the roll in my Levis and my leg was drawn under the hood and through the hooks until the leg, from ankle to, thigh, was hanging in shreds. I was rushed to the hospital and the doctors worked all night cleaning, cutting and sewing over 300 stitches. They had little hope of saving my leg. As soon as possible Presidents Peterson and Jorgensen came and administered to me and in two weeks I was up and starting to walk. It took time but as the months passed the pain left, the leg took on a normal shape and the feeling began to return. Today the scars have almost disappeared and the leg is equal <span id="page-754"></span>in every way to my other - a miracle!

"During these last years I have served in the church as a Seminary teacher six years, as Seminary Stake Coordinator three years, the last year supervising the Seminaries of both San Mateo and San Francisco Stakes. I am also serving as a
member of the San Mateo High Council, and as such acting as advisor to the 458th Quorum of Seventies, the Stake Mission and Educational advisor. We have seen the church in this area grow and prosper. When our Stake was first divided from San Francisco in 1945, there were only some 2,200 members living in the area from South San Francisco to Monterey which was then a Mission. The only chapels were in Palo Alto and San Jose and they were small and inadequate. At this date, 1967, there are five Stakes with about 30,000 members and beautiful chapels dot the whole area. We were privileged to attend the dedication of the beautiful Oakland Temple and hear the Prophet David O. McKay set it apart as a house of the Lord for the performance of the sacred and eternal ordinances.

"We have been wonderfully blessed as a family. Our children are all successfully and happily married. Ann and I are rather enjoying the quiet of the home with all of them gone but we can hardly wait for each opportunity to visit their
families and hope that the coming years will bring a great increase in our posterity. We have been blessed with wonderful health and in times of trial and stress we have been strengthened and comforted. We are both deeply grateful for our wonderful parents, brothers and sisters, and all the far-flung branches of our families, and for the love that binds us together.

"Our testimonies have been strengthened with the years as we have seen the guiding hand of the Lord in all that we have done. Time and space will not allow me to relate a hundredth part of the blessings which He has poured forth upon us and our families. We can only express our gratitude and bear witness that He lives, that He hears and answers prayers, that He is merciful, kind and forgiving. We pray that we may serve Him all <span id="page-755"></span>the days of our lives and that our posterity will be true and faithful members of His church and kingdom forever."

## Byron Charles Peterson 

(20) Byron Charles Peterson (6) was born
Wed. 27 July 1904 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah.
His grandmother Christensen was in attendance at
the birth. There was a small earthquake in the
<span id="page-756"></span>
area that day and when the house began to shake
she thought his father had run into it with the
wagon. There was some damage done by the
quake. On their place the old well sunk and the
city ditch broke, a neighbor's shed caught fire
and burned and the Richfield Tabernacle in
Sevier County cracked.

Byron was quite badly tongue-tied as a child
and couldn't talk plain. Even after several clippings
off and on, by Dr. Hagen, he still had some trouble.
In fact he says that even today he has trouble with
his W's, though we've never noticed it. He was
also a rather determined child, but whether he got
that from his Danish or his Swedish ancestors we
cannot say. He sometimes took his ill-temper out
on his father's pigs, of which there were usually
over a hundred. He would throw rocks at them or
hit them with sticks to make them squeal. He
remembers that they used to squeal real loud whenever
grandmother Christensen came on a visit and
she would say, "those poor pigs are hungry" and
go out and throw them some extra handfuls of
grain. She had a soft spot in her heart for pigs
and they always seemed to know when she was
around and took advantage of it.

Byron was baptized in the Manti Temple a
few weeks after he turned eight, 20 Aug. 1912.
His mother took him there. There was another
boy from Gunnison there with his mother for the
same purpose, and after he was baptized he
broke away from his baptizer and took a good
swim in the font before they captured him and
brought him out for confirmation. This boy's
mother was so embarrassed she hardly ever got
over it. Byron decided that if he ever got another
chance at baptism he would do the same thing - but
he never got another chance.

He was about eight when he started helping
his father on the farm. About his first job was
raking hay. He loved the farm and turned out to
be a farmer and cattle raiser for much of his life.
He says he was somewhat of a runt when he was a
boy but that when he started to grow it seemed the
sky was the limit. He grew to be a tall, big fellow
with a big heart. School to him in his early years
<span id="page-757"></span>
seemed an unnecessary encumbrance, though he
put up with it. In the fifth grade he had whooping
cough real bad and was out part of the year. He
says it took him nine years to get out of the first
eight grades and he was lucky at that. His cousin
Melrose, a year younger, was in his same class
the last few years and was "pretty smart". Byron
attended first year High School and a good part of
Second in the old Gunnison High School building
and then one day in early spring of that second year,
a few weeks before they were to move into the new
high school building, he had an argument with one
of his teachers, an old maid. She insisted that he
make up some back work and he said he wouldn't
do it and quit school then and there - anyway he
was needed by his father for spring planting. He
never went back to school and from that time on
carried a full load on the farm.

Byron remembers attending Sunday School
and Sacrament meetings, and later MIA, but never
Primary. He didn't like Primary. His mother was
very active in the church, as were his two younger
sisters. His father was active also, as far as his
work would permit, and became Bishop of the
Hamilton Ward. Sometime after his mother's
death in 1927 he was approached by the man who
was then his Bishop, in a more or less casual
manner, about serving a mission for the church.
Byron made it known that he was not interested.
He was keeping company with a girl he liked and
contemplating marriage, although she didn't know
it. After a time they broke up. Then 11 Dec.
1929 his father married a widow with three children 
who lived in Redmond. This disturbed Byron
a great deal also. He wasn't long after that getting
word to the right parties that he wanted to serve a
mission.

He was called to go to South Africa, one of
the most distant missions of the church. After he
and his father had visited around in Gunnison,
Goshen, Provo and Salt Lake with various relatives,
he entered the Mission Home in Salt Lake City 10
Mar. 1930. He was going on twenty-six years of
age. He was set apart for his mission by Richard
R. Lyman and left by train for Chicago 20 Mar. at
<span id="page-758"></span>
12:35 p.m. The group of outgoing missionaries
stopped over at Chicago and visited points of
interest and also stopped to see Niagara Falls
enroute. Arriving in New York City they spent a
day seeing the sights and sailed next day on the
"American Farmer" ship for England, docking nine
days later, 3 Apr. 1930 at Plymouth, where they
were welcomed by President Lund. They spent six
days viewing the sights of London and surrounding
areas. Then those going to South Africa left
Southampton, England on board the German ship
"Adolph Werman" 9 Apr. They arrived in Capetown, 
South Africa 1 May 1930.

Byron spent sixteen months laboring in the
Capetown area. On 21 July 1930 in the nearby
town of Woodstock he met an investigator, Johanna
Gregg Fourie, and her husband and children who
were then members of the Dutch Reformed Church.
Several years later Mrs. Fourie and most of her
children joined the LDS church and she credits
Elder Byron Peterson as having had a great deal
to do with their conversions. The youngest Fourie
child, a daughter Felicia, who was five years old
when Byron met the family, later came to Utah and
married his cousin's son, the oldest child of
Virginia C. and Daniel M. Keeler. Mr. Fourie 
joined the church many years after his wife and
came with her to Utah in 1952 to see Felicia and
her family. Here they were permitted to go to the
Salt Lake Temple for their endowments and sealing,
having Felicia sealed to them also. They visited
Byron and his family in Gunnison and Mrs. Fourie
spoke in their Ward and told Byron's part in 
converting her family. He was the third LDS Elder
she ever met. (Mrs. Fourie, now eighty, has been
head of the Primary in South Africa since the day
after her baptism, some more than thirty-four
years ago. She was recently honored with a
write-up-and picture in the Church Section of the
Deseret News.)

"Following his time spent in Capetown, Byron 
served another year in East London, South
Africa, his missionary service being twenty-eight
months in all, not counting traveling time. He left
Capetown 9 Sep. 1932; arrived in Southampton,
<span id="page-759"></span>
England 26 Sep. and left there 28 Sep., docked at
New York City 4 Oct. 1932 and got in Salt Lake
City 8 Oct. General Conference was in session
there and he was met by his sister Ada and her
husband Lin. When he returned to Gunnison he
had been away from home a few days more than
thirty-one months. He was then twenty-eight years
and three months old. His mother, of course, was
gone from the home; his father spent most of his
spare time with his second wife at her home in
nearby Redmond. Ada and her husband had moved
to Delta, Utah; the country was in the midst of the
great depression of the 30's and the Peterson
ranch looked pretty well run down because of it,
and he and his sister Imelda were pretty much
alone. After looking over this gloomy situation,
Byron said he sat down and wept half the night.
Similar fits of discouragement strike numbers of
missionaries upon returning home from successful, 
wonderful missions.

But Byron soon threw himself into the work
on the farm, along with his father. He also became
very active in the Ward, especially in the MIA.
He loved to dance and never missed an opportunity
to attend a church dance or social. Being an
eligible bachelor he was undoubtedly much sought
after as a partner. He had always liked girls and
felt at home with them, having been raised with
sisters. And though he may not have admitted it,
he was looking around for a wife. This went on
for some three years following his return from
his mission.

In August of 1935 a very special event, long
in preparation and well developed, was to be held
on Temple Hill in Manti. A religious pageant with
choruses and trumpeters was to be presented
directly east of the temple, during which time
flood lights were to be turned on, illuminating
for the first time the outside of the beautiful
temple in all its glory. All the people of Sanpete
Valley and the temple district were invited and
guests were expected from all over the state.
Byron had arranged to take six widows from the
Ward in Gunnison with him in his car to Manti the
evening of the presentation, They were driving
<span id="page-760"></span>
along main street in Manti when he caught sight of
a Manti girl he knew walking along with another
girl towards the temple. Always friendly, he
slowed down and called to the girls, "I'll be back
to pick you up."

Depositing his load of widows at the temple
gate he drove his car back and picked up the two
girls, being immediately introduced to Mildred
Olsen, a girl from Manti who was working as a
practical nurse in Salt Lake City but who had
returned especially for the pageant. (Her boy
friend was ushering at the west gate and couldn't
escort her to the affair but planned to walk her
home after - though she didn't tell Byron Peterson
that.) Taking his car seat from the car, Byron
invited Mildred to share it with him sitting on the
temple lawn, which she did. They spent a wonderful 
evening there. Mildred, writing of it later, had
this to say:-- "What a glorious sight to behold -
the inspiring pageant - the magnificent temple
flooded in light - a throng of thousands of people
seated on lawns, walks and hill. Even old Mother
Nature added her blessing by furnishing a total
eclipse of the moon at a very dramatic moment,
plainly visable to all, which greatly enhanced the
scene of unusual splendor." It would have been a
wonderful night to fall in love and perhaps the two
did, though they may not have known it then - for
Cupid is a sly one.

Byron went back to Gunnison afterwards with
his load of widows and Mildred strolled home with
her boy friend. Returning to Salt Lake she found
it hard to forget the evening and Byron Peterson.
She dropped him a card at Christmastime, mentioning 
how much she had enjoyed that August evening 
and discreetly jotting down her Salt Lake address
in small letters in one corner. Byron took the bait
right away and began driving up to Salt Lake to see
her. The trouble was, however, that he seldom
made appointments. He was as apt as not to leave
Gunnison after work with one of his Peterson cousins
and a load of pigs to deliver. He seldom found her
home since she would be out on various cases. One
time, learning that a Gold and Green Ball was to be
held in her Salt Lake Ward, he came all dressed up
<span id="page-761"></span>
to take her to it, without any notification, but found
her tied with a patient she could not leave. Another
time when he called in to see her she had been left
to care for three little children, in the absence of
their parents. They attended an afternoon movie,
taking the children with them. They really had
quite a difficult time getting together - but it was
thus they courted.

Byron Charles Peterson and Mildred Elizabeth
Olsen were married 22 July 1936 in the Manti
Temple, five days before his thirty-second birthday. 
She was twenty-nine and a half (b. 1 Jan.
1907, Ferron, Utah to Andrew Christian and
Hannah Elizabeth Hansen Olsen). Both Mildred's
parents were dead but she owned the family home
in Manti, which she sold. Byron took her home to
live on the farm in Gunnison. There wasn't much
of a celebration but his father suggested that the
family take a little trip over the Twenty-Fourth,
so father Charles, Ada and Lin, Imelda, Byron
and Mildred, went to Ferron Reservoir fishing for
three days - and that is how they spent their honeymoon.

Byron served as President of the Ward
YMMIA and then was put in as First Counselor to
the Bishop of the Hamilton Ward. He was later
placed on the Stake High Council and was active
on the Genealogical committee. Mildred was as
active in church as she could be with a farm household 
to manage and raising her family. She was a
hard worker. They had five children in a little
over eight years, during which time Byron's
father's second wife died of a brain cancer and he
returned to live with them in the home. Charles
was married again, however, on 14 May 1945 to
another widow and went to live at her home elsewhere 
in Gunnison about two months before
Mildred's fifth baby was born. The farm and
cattle were doing well and furnishing them with
a good living and things looked bright ahead.

Two months after this Byron came down
with a severe sore throat and grumped around the
house for several days. It seemed he had an
ordinary cold, but though he spent a great deal
of time on the bed he couldn't rest. The morning
<span id="page-762"></span>
of 15 Sep. 1945 he arose from the bed and made
his way unsteadily towards the kitchen where
Mildred was finishing up the children's breakfast
chores, preparatory to fixing him a good breakfast,
for he had said he was famished. She turned to
look at him as he reached the door - he looked
terrible. Suddenly he seemed to stiffen and
clutched at the doorframe; he could not take another
step. She helped him onto a stool then phoned the
doctor.

After the diagnosis and the prescribing of
several sets of pills, the doctor left the house.
Mildred followed him outside. "What is it Doctor?"
she said. He said he couldn't be certain but that if
her husband went unconscious in a short time she'd
know he had polio. Byron went unconscious alright,
and the next day (16 Sept.) was rushed to the 
General Hospital in Salt Lake City where he remained
unconscious for three weeks while his life hung in
the balance. He lived, but his right hand and arm
were stricken - and his legs - his poor pain-filled
legs. It was three months before he could sit up.
Eight months of therapy and hospital care brought
back the life and strength to his hand and arm - but
his legs? He never walked again. He was allowed
to return home a few days at Christmas and again
in early spring for the same length of time.

Mildred and the children all came down with
a mild form of polio to a greater or less degree,
but they were not hospitalized. The children soon
grew better but Mildred's trouble was in her spine
where she suffered a lot of pain, as she did in her
arms and shoulders. She was unable to lift anything
but she couldn't stop with a family to care for. It
took her five months to get back to near normal.
In the meantime Byron's father, Charles, passed
away suddenly just three weeks after Byron was
stricken. Someone made a typed copy of the proceedings 
at the funeral and this was sent to Byron.
It was poor comfort for the loss of a father, on top
of everything else, but it was comfort nevertheless 
and appreciated. We have heard the expression
"It never rains but it pours" - how true that must
have seemed to the Peterson family at that time.

Byron was brought home to stay 10 May 1946.
<span id="page-763"></span>
Five nurses and one doctor from the hospital came
with him to give instructions on his care as well
as orient the family to the realization of the emotional
struggle their father and husband was going
to endure getting back into society. The doctor
said, "No one in the world can make him walk
again and nothing in the world can do more to
help him now than the patient understanding and
love of his family." So Mildred rolled up her
sleeves and went on with the job of nurse and
doctor as well as loving wife and mother.

Byron made wonderful progress. Before
long he was directing the operation of his farm
and livestock, from a truck he learned to drive 
or a wheelchair. For three years after that, with
the help of his son Kent, he hauled water by truck
from State Canal to their one thousand acre range
at Lone Cedar around Scipio Lake, 11 miles west
of Gunnison, to quench the thirst of a hundred and
fifty head of cattle for about a month and a half each
year, until the cattle found their way to the small
lake. They made several trips a day doing this
during that time.

The fall of 1947 they bought a duplex in town
at 78 East lst South, and rented the farmhouse to
others. This made it easier for the children to
attend school and for Mildred to do the shopping
and other family business. They still reside there
today, living in one side of the duplex and renting
out the other. A cement ramp from the front
cement porch makes it possible for Byron to go
and come at will in his wheelchair. He has worn
out three of these and now has a fourth one, this
with pneumatic tires to make it easier going. He
has wheeled himself downtown and to church and
local funerals, where the brethren lift him in his
wheelchair up and down the steps. He drives his
own car to other cities and cemeteries to attend
the funerals and burials of relatives and friends.
Most of us Christensens have seen him at such
places. Memorial Day always finds him at Gunnison
Cemetery and then Manti Cemetery, near the
graves of departed loved ones, waiting to greet
other relatives he knows will come to decorate
the graves. He was and is a man who loves his
<span id="page-764"></span>
family and relatives dearly, one and all. Some
have this great spirit of family loyalty, while with
others it is almost entirely absent.

Byron eventually found it necessary to sell
out his ranch and cattle interests, first the cattle
then the range and lastly the farm, or ranch, of
372 acres. He says one of the saddest days of his
life was the day he was forced to part with the
ranch - he says he shed enough tears over it to
irrigate the place. He has sent both his sons and
one daughter on missions and both his sons to
college. All his children are doing very well,
He and Mildred have raised a fine family.

For the last three summers Byron has
assisted in operating the Tourist Information booth
in Gunnison City Park and expects to do the same
this summer (1969). It has been a great experience
and he is well qualified - both because of his friendliness 
and interest in people, and his knowledge of
the area and its history. We copy from an article
in the Deseret News:-- "Gunnison, Sanpete County - more
than 3,000 persons learned more about tourist
attractions in south-central Utah through the tourist
information booth operated at the City park during
1967. Officials said a total of 766 vehicles stopped
for information. The booth was open for 677 hours
and operated by Emil Nielsen, Byron Peterson, and
Mrs. Ferdinand Hansen. It was sponsored by the
Gunnison Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints through the assistance of the
Gunnison Businessman's Association and Sanpete
County agencies." An account of Byron's experience
with visitors there would fill another ten pages.

His service at the booth has been interspersed
by numerous trips with friends by car, truck or
jeep into the outlying areas of the region, but more
particularly into the wonderlands of eastern and
southern Utah. He is a great traveling companion.
He can talk for hours about the beauties of Utah's
highways and byways, mountains, canyons, deserts
and streams. Few retain a better knowledge of
places they visit than he. It has been twenty-three
and a half years now since he stepped foot upon the
sod - he who had been more apt to run at his work
or play than walk. We have never heard him
<span id="page-765"></span>
complain or grumble at his lot, though he must do
at times, as Mildred can surely testify. With it
all he has retained his great sense of humor,
almost bubbling over with it at times. What a
lucky man he was to get a helpmate like Mildred.

## Myrtle Ivy Christensen

(21) Myrtle Ivy Christensen (1) was born 10
Nov. 1904 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the house
built for the family about 1895/96 in the southwest
part of town and which is still standing (1969).

When Ivy was five and a half an epidemic of
<span id="page-766"></span>
the dreaded disease scarlet fever hit the small town
and her family was among the victims; a red flag
of quarantine hung on their gatepost. Her father
was away on "The Weber" with the sheep at the
time and before he could return her sister Orilla,
not quite two years older than herself, died of the
disease, 22 May 1910. Her father returned to comfort 
the distressed family and just in time to bid her
thirteen year old sister, Elora, goodby, for she
succumbed five days after Orilla. Joint funeral
services were held for these two beautiful sisters
on the lawn in front of their home and they were
buried side by side in the Gunnison Cemetery. Ivy
and the four other children were spared, including
the eight months old baby Farrald, yet the home
was never quite the same again.

July of that year 1910 Ivy's family moved to
a comfortable home with a spacious yard in Salt
Lake City which her father had purchased from his
brother Andrew and which was reported to have
been built for early church President John Taylor.
(Details of this home, written by Andrew's daughter 
Edythe, are included in an earlier chapter.)
Ivy has written a little about her life from here on
and from this we quote:

"I remember Grandfather and Grandmother 
Christensen very well. They used to come and stay
at our house almost every year after we moved to
Salt Lake, to attend General Conference. One
thing I especially recall is that after they had gone
to bed each night, since Pearl's and my bedroom
adjoined theirs, they would talk to us what seemed
like hours about politics.

"I started school at the Roosevelt School,
9 East and 33 South, and went to eighth grade in
the Hawthorn School on 17 South 7 East. I attended
High School at Granite High, 33 South 5 East. I was
active in sports of all kinds, especially outdoor
sports. I enjoyed dramatics in High School, which
took us out of town and to different schools and
churches to put on small plays.

"I took piano lessons for two years from
Marion Cannon. I was organist in the Primary and
Sunday School in Wandemere Ward. I played for
<span id="page-767"></span>
MIA dances for about a year. I have also done a
lot of lovely handwork over the years. In summers
we lived at the ranch in Wyoming or over in the
summer home in Weber Canyon, which ranch we
called 'The Weber'.

These lovely summers on the ranches in
Wyoming and Utah came to an end for Ivy and
others of their family, with the exception of Pearl,
when their father met with his death on the ranch
in Wyoming, 5 Oct. 1917, from an accident a few
days earlier. When word of their father's accident
reached Salt Lake City, Ivy's mother left Ivy, then
lacking a month of being thirteen, in charge of her
two younger brothers, eight and five-and-a-half,
while she rushed to the side of her dying husband.
A kind neighbor kept an eye on them the several 
days their mother was gone. This was indeed a
time of heartbreak for the bereft family.

Ivy continues: "I was married when nineteen
years of age, 29 Oct. 1923, in Salt Lake City to
Melvin Glen Campbell (born 3 Oct. 1904 in Salt
Lake City to Robertson Sim and Agnes Hind Napier
Campbell). I have worked most of my married life
so have had little time for other things outside of
that and raising a nice family, two girls and one
boy. A third girl and our last child died the day
of birth, unnamed. I worked for Auerbach's and
the Paris Department Stores for two years and
then, during World War II, I worked at the Remington
Arms Plant for a year. Since then I have
worked at Snelgrove's Ice Cream Store for some
twenty-three years and am still employed there
at the present time. 

"My husband has been employed by the City
here in Salt Lake most of our married life except
for one year (abt. 1932) when we lived in Los
Angeles, California; up until the time he suffered
his heart attack and stroke 9 Nov. 1966. The road
to recovery has been a slow old road to follow. He
has made more than one-trip to the hospital since
then. He isn't working but has really been blessed
since he got out of the hospital the last time. He
gets really tired of doing nothing. With spring
coming, however, I'm sure he can keep busy and
will feel even better. It isn't good to be idle and
<span id="page-768"></span>
that is why I am going to go on working as long
as I can.

"We went through the temple in Salt Lake
11 Sep. 1968 and were married for eternity, after
having taken the Project Temple course. We are
so happy about this. We only wish that our children 
were sealed to us, but perhaps someday they
too will see the importance of it and prepare themselves
for this great blessing. At least we have now made a 
start in the right direction and set the
example for them."

## Byard Alfonso Bartholomew 

(22) Byard Alfonso Bartholomew (5) was
born 2 Mar. 1905 in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah.
Byard was a beautiful child but was born with a
malfunctioning heart that in spite of all available
medical help caused his death at four years nine
months and six days at the family home in Gunnison, 
Sanpete, Utah, 18 Dec. 1909. A brief funeral
service was held at the home the following Wednesday, 
23 Dec. 1909, and he was buried in the
Gunnison City Cemetery.

## Albert Sherman Christensen

(23) Albert Sherman Christensen (4) was
born 9 June 1905 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah in the
home on 155 North 2nd West. The family was in
quarantine for measles at the time. Mary Gledhill
of Gunnison had been hired to help in the home and
was on hand. Aunt Retta Snow (later Neff) was
there to see that "Little Jennie", her beloved sister,
was given every advantage in the difficult process
of childbirth and her excited commands were
obeyed, if not by the attending physician at least
by everyone else around, as Mary herself later
testified.

Sherman wrote his own history for this book
and titled it, "Momentary Images On the Screen
After the Projector is Turned Off". We 
quote:-- "What we felt and observed as children may not
have been any closer to reality than our recollection
of those times. Our original childhood
impressions could be less accurate than the distant
recollections of them, since maturity may have
brought a degree of understanding to original
unsophisticated impressions. But the trouble
with memory is that we forget - and that we
remember the conditioning or qualification of
<span id="page-770"></span>
intervening years rather than the things that actually
were, or what we actually were. Thus what we
remember from our early days is often impressionistic 
rather than sharply detailed.

"My earliest impression is the aura of
impending doom created by Halley's Comet. As I
now recall, we were living in our old home just
north of Depot Street. I remember being held up
to an upstairs window but whether I actually saw
the comet I don't really know. The talk of the
world coming to an end was even more impressive
than the comet. There was no immediate panic in
my mind; the threat was not sharply personalized,
but there was a pervasive and ominous awe and
regret that it might have to happen. But it didn't
then - and life went on.

"I remember staying at the old Henry rock
house south of our new home just before the new
home was completed. Aunt Vena was staying with
us. Perhaps Father was on a court assignment.
I recall being on the porch at Grandfather Snow's
home, talking through the screen to Mother and
Elaine, who were quarantined there with scarlet
fever. Disease meant lonesomeness then, not fear,
suffering or death as it comes to mean when we
grow older.

"Most of my recollections are of subsequent
events, I shall not repeat here recollections and
factual data included in my book 'The Hard Rich
Soil' (Pub. 1966) but shall attempt to mention some
of my impressions and memories of circumstances
and persons not covered there.

"My memories of our new house are kaleidoscopic.
I recall the fireplace - or 'grate' as we
called it - the blue-red flame from the pinion pine
wood and the warmth and security that it meant to
us as we sprawled on the floor, reading or just
dreaming. A turn of mind brings memories of
that fine old oak library table bearing on its lower
shelf a massive leather-bound book containing the
portraits of all the Presidents of the United States.
The living room does not seem complete in my
mind's eye without Grandpa Snow sitting in a chair
at the side of the fireplace, a hand-rolled cigarette
<span id="page-771"></span>
curling pleasant smoke as he held it and golden bits
of Bull Durham tobacco flecked across his vest.
He was always very pleasant company for us children 
and we felt relaxed and right at home with him.
There seemed to be an aura of romance about him.
We had visions of his Indian fighting days, and we
knew even then that he was a hunter of deer. We
were not quite so relaxed around Grandfather Christensen.
While we loved him, he was more nervous
probably and sought more to maintain a semblance
of order. Why, we could not understand then, but
I must say that age brings insight. Both grandfathers, 
however, were loving and loved. Grandmother 
Christensen made us feel especially comfortable 
and easy, and between her and the two
grandfathers, both our relaxation and good order
were assured.

"Again, at the home on Depot Street, I 
remember the big north porch, especially during
rainstorms, where we would sit with Mother and
Dad and watch the lightning streak through the sky,
counting at least three between the flash and the
thunder to make sure that we had not been fatally
stricken; and watching the collar buttons of rain on
the pavement; Elaine in the sunroom--why I recall
this I don't remember; Gin (Virginia) going out on
a date; sleeping on the box seat until reminded by
Father's threat that if I didn't go upstairs to bed 
he would leave the sword (given to me by Sheriff
Johnson of Price) by my side and let me guard the
house all night; hauling our Christmas tree by
sleigh from the canyon - a family expedition of 
high spirits and great merriment - and then later
the Christmas tree in the hall all bright and fragrant 
with wax candles; the swing out back; climbing 
the old walnut tree; a tree-house in the willow
tree; Mother presiding over the dinner table in the
big dining room; walking along the row of young
pines in the snowflakes with Elaine as we came
home from a Christmas shopping trip; Mother
reading to us from 'The Last of the Mohicans' on
the front lawn; Dil, Nat, Phil, Hale, Gin, Elaine,
Dad, Aunt Myrtle -- a flood of fragmentary
impressions which I can hardly put my mind on,
let alone my finger, engulfs me and I leave them
in their totality of love and security and excitement
<span id="page-772"></span>
and home and comfort and dreams.

"Uncle Joe Snow, when I first remember him,
was a man of polish and dreams. He visited frequently 
at our home on Depot Street and stayed with
us a time or two it seems. I remember him saying,
'If you have a dollar and are hungry, spend it for a
haircut, a shine and a press and you'll be ahead.'
Uncle Ed Snow was also well liked among the smaller
fry. He was somewhat brief, bluff and blunt but yet
full of fun. Uncle Charles and Aunt Emma Peterson
at Gunnison made almost a second home for me at
times. While there cousin Byron and I would hunt
rabbits, hike in the low hills on and adjoining their
farm, and have a wonderful time generally. All of
our Aunts and Uncles on both sides of the family
were well liked and wonderful to us.

"Christensen family reunions were very
special. The earliest I remember was at Uncle
Arthur's in Gunnison. Aunt Millie was especially
good to us then and when she ran the eating-house
in Manti - in fact at all times - why limit it? I
remember driving with Father to Salina hospital to
visit Uncle Arthur when he was ill. Later at the
LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City I, among others,
gave blood. In those days the transfusions were
direct from doner to patient. His death and funeral
were a great sadness - greater because of a sharp
renewal of the memory of Mother's death, as he
was buried not far from her grave. I shall never
forget walking up Depot Street to Aunt Lou (Lucille)
Black's with Hale and perhaps Phil, sensing that
something was very, very wrong, and of Aunt Lou
putting her arms around us and saying, 'You must
be very brave' before she told us that Mother had
died. Even then I couldn't realize the fact although
a hopeless feeling engulfed me.

"Uncle Charles Riddle was something special
since he worked in or owned, or both, a hardware
store, handling all sorts of interesting and exciting
items -- guns, baseballs and a dozen other things
of special interest to boys. Aunt Claytie, Mother's
oldest sister, was wonderful to us and her children
were very close to us, as were most of our cousins.

"What shall I say about Aunt Retta Neff?
After Mother died I lived with her and Uncle Andrew
<span id="page-773"></span>
in Heber City for a winter. Before that she was a
charming young woman with lots of pep and 
fun - this she continued to be to me up to the time of
her death at eighty-four. While Mother, Father,
Elaine and Virginia were attending the World Fair
at San Francisco, Calif., Hale, Phil and I stayed
with Aunt Retta and Uncle Andrew in Heber City.
All her life since that time I thought, and still
think, she was one of the most interesting and
lovable persons I have ever 
known - cantankerous - spunky - enthusiastic - lovable. My 
earliest recollection of her is of her pounding us children
on the backs with love taps in her obvious joy to
see us. She was a dear! I was grateful after
many years that my wife, Lois, came to know
her too and that they had an especially close association 
during Aunt Retta's later years. I felt
that the many kindnesses Lois extended to her and
the joy each seemed to feel in the other's company
tended to reciprocate in part for the many things
that she did for me when I was young.

"I remember when Cousin Harold Christensen 
was courting. Sometimes he would stay with
us, sleeping in my room. Uncle Joseph, his
father, is remembered from my early days at our
Gunnison ranch. Almost always we would stop at
his place and visit before proceeding on across
the Rocky Point to the ranch. Uncle Andrew
Christensen, prior to 1919-1920, was a more or
less mysterious and exotic figure - we rarely saw
him but we would hear that he would be in Europe,
then California, then some place else. In the year
1919/20 he and Father became jointly interested
in the Starr Ranch, where I worked for two summers. 
For the first summer Uncle Andrew
managed the ranch and I lived with him and Aunt
Sarah. Sheldon, Wendell and I worked hard, got
up early, played hard. I was treated as a member
of the family. They were fine people. Injun, my
first horse, which Father gave to me and Hale
when we were hardly old enough to climb up on
his back, had long since faded away. Uncle Andrew
let each of us three 'working boys' choose a horse
from a herd of young ones that probably had never
been in a corral. I chose a fine black mare which
I called Pigeon. I broke her myself. (She once
<span id="page-774"></span>
threw and almost broke me in the process.) I rode
her home to Manti at the close of the farming season.
She was a dream, or so it seemed then, and
so she still seems to me now.

"Our association with Father in those early
days, both in and away from home, was very satisfying. 
He was too busy, I suppose, to take us
hunting or fishing much but he was constantly
having us accompany him to the sheep herd, the
ranches and elsewhere where his business called
him. At first we would wait in the car at the
Gunnison ranch while he conferred with his farmer
or inspected the crops or irrigated. As we grew
older we were taught to lend a hand - driving or
herding sheep, irrigating, weeding or thinning
beets, or helping with the lambing. Always there
was the solid, unfailing figure of Father leading
out. He was constantly appreciative - and thoughtful 
in bringing us water or fig newtons or crackers
and cheese or candy, to ease the pain of work.
Responsibility was always available for us to
assume, with his encouragement but never with
his insistence.

"And we grew up in a world of security,
peace and love. Aunt Myrtle carrying on in this
spirit after Mother died. We leaned perhaps too
much upon the staunch figure of our Father but
perhaps it wasn't too much, for after trial and
error we learned to be leaned on too. We always
felt great pride in both the Christensen and Snow
families and much satisfaction in their association.
Love and pride in family have been born and bred
into us. Hence, in response to a request for a
sketch of my life for this Christensen book, I am
happy to note these fragmentary family recollections
and my greatest accomplishments, marrying Lois
Bowen (b. 10 Aug. 1905 in Spanish Fork, Utah to
William Jones and Gudrun Dena Bjarnason Bowen)
and our three outstanding children, Dr. A. Kent
(teaching in the medical school in Stanford), Karen,
and Krege (who with a CPA and a Master's Degree
in Business Administration is now studying law),
and their lovely families.

"Aside from family, my interests are in the
law, in mountains, books, music, poetry, flowers,
<span id="page-775"></span>
stars, clouds - and the other wonders of nature
and life - all having roots as interests in my early
recollections. When I feel confused or uncertain
and have a special need for strength and balance,
I find nothing more helpful than to return to the
scene of these early influences--Sanpete 
County--and again get my fingers and my heart into 'The
Hard Rich Soil.'"

From a recent book, "The Sons of Brigham"
by Dr. T. Earl Pardoe (pub 1969) we have received
permission to copy the following:-- "At Brigham
Young University Sherman was a varsity debator
and took part in major drama each year of attendance.
He had leading parts in such shows as 'State of the
Union', 'Bill of Divorcement', 'The Music Master',
'The Winslow Boy', 'Lady Windermere's Fan', 'The
Man Who Came to Dinner', 'Peter Ibertsen' and
'Julius Caesar'. Few will ever forget the quarrel
scene between Brutus (Sherman) and Cassius (Dr.
Parley A. Christensen). It smacked of highest
professional power. This appreciation of the
dramatic carried over to the court room and
disturbed several of Sherman's legal antagonists
who lacked that ability. Also at Brigham Young
University Sherman was praised for his debating
power and was elected to student body 
offices. . . . An ardent Republican, he early became 
interested in politics and led discussion groups all through
high school and college. He desired to emulate
his able father.

"When A. Sherman was nominated Utah's
second federal district judge, considerable data
was accumulated to be sent to President Dwight
D. Eisenhower to submit to the Senate. A lifetime
appointment requiring Senate confirmation was a
prize sought by more than fifty prominent attorneys
over the nation. Sherman was recommended by
Utah's senior Senator, Arthur V. Watkins. . . .
Senator Watkins, in part, stated, 'Because of the
usually high calibre of candidates, selection was
extremely difficult. Efforts were made to select
a nominee of the highest qualifications. In addition
to sound legal training the nominee was expected
to have wide experience as a trial lawyer, because
the federal court is a trial court. Furthermore,
<span id="page-776"></span>
he was expected to be a man of integrity, possessed
of judicial temperament and of an age to permit good
service on the bench for years to come. . . A. Sherman 
Christensen met all those requirements. I have
known him and his family for many years and have
watched his performance as an outstanding lawyer
and citizen. In all circumstances he has stamped
himself as a man of competence and ability, with
an excellent reputation for honesty and integrity.
He will make a fine reputation for himself and Utah
as a member of the federal judiciary system. He
has abundantly proved worthy of this appointment.'"

From a recent biography of Sherman we glean
this information:-- "Working as Assistant Business
Specialist in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic
Commerce, A. Sherman Christensen attended night
school at National University, Washington D. C.,
where he obtained his LLB degree in 1931 and a
delayed degree of Juris Doctor from George
Washington University as of the same year.
Admitted to the District of Columbia and Utah
bars, he practiced law in Provo beginning in 1933,
specializing in trial work. He was President of
the Junior Bar conference 1937-38 and served as
a member of the Utah Board of Bar Examiners in
1939-1942. He also was the unsuccessful Republican 
candidate for Congress in 1940. In 1942 he
enlisted in the Navy and after officer indoctrination
served as Officer-in-Charge of the Naval Auxiliary
Air Station for two years and thereafter, until the
war ended, as Staff Operations Officer, Naval Air
Bases, Twelfth Naval District.

"Resuming the practice of law in Provo after
the war, he was elected a member of the Utah State
Bar Commission in 1949, and to the office of President 
of the Utah State Bar in 1951. He was later a
member on the Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure 
which made recommendations to the Supreme
Court of Utah resulting in the adoption of rules for
the State patterned after the Federal Rules of
Procedure.

"In 1954 he was appointed United States
District Judge for the District of Utah and has
served in that position ever since. His primary
responsibilities have been within this District but
<span id="page-777"></span>
he has been invited to sit frequently on the United
States Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit and as
a visiting trial judge throughout the country,
including New York, Washington D. C., Los
Angeles, Boston, and Kansas City. He was a
member of the five-judge team initially assigned
by Chief Justice Earl Warren to devise and carry
out special procedures in the Eastern District of
New York, which then had the heaviest backlog of
cases inthe country. The project, which came to
be known as 'The Brooklyn Experiment' was successful 
in updating that district, and other similar
programs since have been carried out elsewhere.

"For ten years Judge Christensen served as
a member of the six-judge committee on revisions
of the laws of the Judicial Conference of the United
States, charged with making recommendations concerning 
bills proposed in Congress affecting the
jurisdiction and venue of United States courts.
When the Committee this year (1969) was consolidated 
with the Committee on Court Administration,
and the membership of all committees reconstituted, 
Chief Justice Warren appointed Judge Christensen 
as a member of the new Committee
on Court Administration for a term of six years.

"He has written extensively concerning court
administration and federal jurisdiction, including
four articles for the American Bar Association
Journal (two in collaboration with former Chief 
Judge Orie L. Phillips) and a number of other
articles that have been published in Federal Rules
Decisions and separately distributed by West
Publishing Company. Aside from this he has had
published, under an assumed name, a book of
poems: 'Thoughtobiography' (Vantage Press 
Inc., 1967) and edited and published his father's 
autobiography and letters, which he titled 'The Hard Rich
Soil' (J. Grant Stevenson, 1966).

"Judge Christensen has been a leading proponent 
of preliminary jury instructions, a system
designed to acquaint jurors at the beginning of a
case with the significant rules of law they are to
apply rather than to reserve this information
wholly for the end, as has been the custom, when
the jury's views concerning the evidence may be
<span id="page-778"></span>
erroneously fixed for lack of such information during 
the trial. Copies of his preliminary instructions
in an anti-trust suit last year were circulated among
other trial judges by the Tenth Circuit Committee
on Procedure. He lectured on jury instructions as
a member of the faculty of the School for New 
Federal Judges, sessions of which were held in
Denver, San Francisco and Washington D. C. last
year (1968). He also has taken time to speak frequently 
to groups of young people and last month,
in a series of moot court programs designed by
youth counselors, psychiatrists, social workers
and attorneys to promote improved insight concerning 
parent-youth conflicts, he appeared as
presiding judge in various Stakes under the auspices
of the Mutual Improvement Association."

Sherman and Lois, who have resided at 1488
Harvard Ave. since moving to Salt Lake City some
fourteen years ago, recently (Mar. 1969) sold their
home there and moved to lovely "Bonneville
Towers", 777 East South Temple, where they
occupy Apt. #9A. In summers they hide away
when they can in their rustic chalet "Krishaven"
in beautiful Provo Canyon. Sherman will be eligible
for retirement in June of 1970 but hasn't yet made
up his mind whether or not he will take that step
then.

## Arthur Melrose Christensen 

(24) Arthur Melrose Christensen (8) was
born 22 June 1905 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in
the old Gledhill home at 367 West lst North, which
is still standing (1969). He is reported to have
been a beautiful child, to which his early pictures
testify. The family called him "Rosy". He was
baptized a member of the LDS church 1 Nov. 1913.
He attended school in Gunnison in winters and graduated 
from High School there. In summers he
helped his father on the farm. Finally tiring of
farming he traveled about doing various jobs and
then settled down in Dividend, Utah, where he took
up mining for the Tintic Standard Mining Co.,
which pursuit he followed for about ten years.

It was while living in Dividend that he met
his first wife, Reva Giles (b. 30 Jan. 1911, Heber
City, Utah to Franklin Shelton and Acie LuVella
Provost Giles). She was a beautiful girl and they
made a handsome couple. They were married
1 Feb. 1929 in Provo, Utah. Reva (now Mrs.
Kinder) says they announced their marriage to
his family two evenings later in the Eagle House
Hotel in Manti, Utah, when they attended his
parents' twenty-fifth wedding anniversary party
<span id="page-780"></span>
there, They wrapped their marriage license up
with the gift they presented them.

Some years later Melrose, Reva and their
two children moved to Salt Lake City and he became 
employed as an automotive mechanic for the
Frank Edwards Company, in which capacity he
served for some twenty-three years, according to
a record published at the time of his death. Cousin 
A. Owen Bartholomew says that he remembers
that "Melrose had a racing car at one time. He
was the mechanic and another fellow the driver
and they went around to various places racing and
nearly lost their shirts."

His brother Wesley's wife Leola said of
Melrose, "We lived closely for many years in
Dividend. He and Wesley were very close although
I think their outlook on life and the future was somewhat 
different. Melrose was always a favorite of
mine and I loved him dearly - he was always so kind
and thoughtful of us." His sister Grace once wrote,
"The older I get the more I appreciate my wonderful 
brothers. They are all so different and so
lovable!"

Years after their marriage Melrose and Reva
separated. On 31 May 1950 in Ely, Nevada, Melrose 
married Mrs. Drucilla Edna Thompson
Colman (b. 8 Jan. 1909 Cedar City, Utah to
William M. and Elizabeth Ann Paramore Thompson).
She was a nurse and operated the apartment in
which they lived. It was her third marriage and
of course the second for Melrose. The last part
of his life Melrose was an invalid, confined to their
apartment at 223 Third Ave., and Drucilla took care
of him. He suffered from what they called "miners'
consumption".

Throughout his life Melrose was always rather
close to his mother so it does not seem too strange
that they should have departed this life within a very
short time of each other. She died Wed. 1 Nov. 1961
at 2 p.m. in her home in Salt Lake City and he died
Wed. 8 Nov. 1961 at 8:15 p.m. in a Salt Lake
hospital. Each funeral was held the Saturday
following each death at the same local Mortuary
and while Millie was buried in Manti beside her
<span id="page-781"></span>
husband, Arthur Melrose was buried in the Mt.
Olivet Cemetery in Salt Lake City. Less than two
years following his death, 27 July 1963 his wife
Drucilla passed away and was buried beside him
in Mt. Olivet Cemetery.

## Sheldon Bartholomew Christensen

(25) Sheldon Bartholomew Christensen (2)
as he himself explains, "Was born in Salt Lake
City, Utah Nov. 27, 1905, on Seventh East and
about Wilmington Ave., in a small dwelling with
outside plumbing. Sixty-three years later I am
still living in Salt Lake City, Utah, now on Melodie
Ann Way in a large house with inside plumbing and
a mortgage duly amortized."

In these brief words Sheldon B. spans the
<span id="page-782"></span>
greater part of a lifetime of activity, service and
success. But there is more, much more to be
told. By tracing the goings and comings of his
family we can form a skeleton of his early life
and by the writings of his brothers and sisters
can put a little flesh upon the bones and a bit of
blood into the veins. However, he alone can add
the spirit, the character and the personality to
his story.

Europe:-- England, Denmark, Germany,
France - all beckoned his family when Sheldon
was going on five, with the winter of 1910/11 being
spent mostly in Germany. His sister Edythe tells
that with their return to Utah, he could speak only
in German. Can you imagine him trying to explain
to his Grandmother Bartholomew, of English origin,
his desire for some bread and jam?

Provo, Utah - was where he started school
and where his family lived in three different homes
in the three years it spent there; Rexburg, 
Idaho - was again the family's home for three years, with
winters spent in school and summers at various
garden and farm assignments, since Sheldon's
parents were well agreed on the disciplinary value
of work, and where he received a patriarchal blessing, 
along with others of the children; LaVerkin,
Utah - residence of his family for a year, 1917/18,
and where he again attended public school. His
sister Edythe tells about living in LaVerkin, "As
summer arrived in earnest with its dry, hot heat,
we were settled in a four-roomed log hut situated
on the rise of a hill which looked down upon the
murky Virgin River. It was pretty desolate,
Lizards scuttled over the sandy soil among the sage
and greasewood. To the west rose the remnants of
an orchard of almond, fig and pomegranate trees...
The log hut was furnished with only makeshift hand
constructed pieces. Comfort facilities were a
distance from the place and our refrigerator was
the usual 'Dixie cooler'. Our main duty outside of
the home was to take turns 'watching' the springs
where there was a bath house of sorts to which
travelers or townspeople came now and then to
bathe in the healing, sulphurous waters, and for
which privilege we collected a fee and gave aid and
<span id="page-783"></span>
service, We moved into a brick house nearer
town in time for school."

Hinckley, Utah - this became the abode of
the Christensen family for the next year. Wendell
tells of the long, hard trip Sheldon and he made in
hauling the family effects by team and wagon to
their new home, which Edythe describes as
follows: "A two story white brick structure became 
our home in Hinckley. It was on the out-skirts 
of town, the usual mile or so from school,
and stood on a small farm, the outlook of which
was rather bleak since the land was of a dry alkaline 
quality. Sugar beets grew in spotted acres
but alfalfa and especially its seed proved to be the
main crop of income. The older boys, Wendell
and Sheldon, were teenagers and, under the supervision 
of mother, trying to farm the unfruitful acres
mostly alone and craving a bit of fun on their own,
I'm sure."

The younger brother Luther was not aware
that life was anything but fun at Hinckley for there
were animals there. He tells one incident: "It
was customary to turn hay over when it got wet
and my brother Sheldon was sent to do this. The
hay was full of little field mice and sometimes we
would find a rabbit. Sheldon took a gun for this
purpose, One day I went along and as Sheldon
turned the hay he saw a rabbit. Quickly he grabbed
the shotgun and put a shell in - but the rabbit got
away. I had been snapping the empty gun at the
mice previously and as Sheldon put the gun down
I picked it up to continue my game and almost got
his toe with the shell."

Sheldon makes this comment: "I cannot
share anyone's view that there was bleakness at
Hinckley, LaVerkin, or any other place we lived.
To me they were all wonderful areas. Each had
its own peculiar charm. Really, the only bleaknesses 
I have experienced in life have been my
own delinquencies and vagrancies. True, I didn't
invent stupidity but often I have brought it into
exquisite focus."

Star Ranch, north of Nephi, Utah provided a
home for Sheldon's family for the next several
<span id="page-784"</span>
summers. Though the older children were expected
to work hard with the crops, cattle and other chores,
yet it was somewhat of a paradise for them nevertheless, 
as each was given his own riding pony. The
beautiful setting amid lake, lush meadows with wild
flowers, nearby canyons and mountains, offered
spots for recreation during happy leisure hours.
Edythe writes, "We were by ourselves and our
entertainment was had with each other, picnics,
rides together up the draws of nearby canyons, etc.
These were busy, beautiful summers. We always
attended church when possible. I recall the first
time father drove our family to the LDS Sunday
School at Mona. The structure where it met was
an early rock model of pioneer vintage. There
was but one hall; the few class divisions were made
by drawing curtains. As our car stopped in front
for us to alight we noticed the door and windows
being filled with curious spectators. Flushed and
a little embarrassed we managed to walk the long
path and into the sanctity of the building."

Provo, Utah - again became their home during those 
winters of 1919-1922 in order that the
children might attend school. Edythe was in college
and the older boys in high school. An epidemic of
influenza hit the city and Edythe writes of this, "The
first seige of the flu struck while we were at Hinckley
but our family had escaped. But at Provo the winter
of 1920, one after another of us took to couch or bed
except father, who had gone back to Star Ranch.
Even mother and the baby became ill. The grade
schools closed down. We were only one family of
the majority so afflicted and it was impossible to
obtain a nurse. Our overworked family doctor was
only able to call a few times. Many died but our
group was spared to slowly recover." Luther has
many happy memories of those Provo days - bringing 
the Christmas tree down by sleigh from the
mountains; skiing on barrel stave skis from the top
of the chicken coop; gathering watercress in early
spring from nearby pasture brooks and selling it
in bunches.

Salt Lake City, in a house on the bend of the
Jordan River, was the family's next home.
Financial reverses had struck at its roots and all
<span id="page-785"></span>
those who could were forced to find work outside
the home to help out. Edythe was called to interrupt
her studies in Boston and came home and
found immediate employment. Wendell and
Sheldon went to work. It was somewhat of a 
discouraging time for all - but they went ahead
bravely. Sheldon writes something of those 
days:-- "When Wendell and I pursued our first employment
opportunities there was one situation that should
be documented. Rather interestingly, one of
Father's visionary projects, which was associated
with some reproachable promoters, landed Wendell
and me on a job at Santa Fe Springs, Calif. in the
heat of a new oilfield boom. We were assigned to
a small, half-baked (literally) experimental oil
refinery. Our wages were largely deferred, so
we lived for months in the corner of a machine
shop and subsisted on rice, canned milk, sugar
and unclaimed Valencia oranges from half dead
trees abandoned to ruthless overkill of machines
and spray of crude oil. We were merely roustabouts 
or flunkies. At best it was dirty work and
we were far from best. Little did we know we
were making history in industry,

"The refinery technique was dubbed the
'Wade Process'. The objective was to force
through a nozzle low grade crude oil into coils
within a high temperature kiln, which coil encompassed 
iron shavings to serve as catalists. There
was a piping system from the hot coils into a condensation 
tower so that the initial volatile product
was practically usable gasoline. In other words,
we were actually cracking the heavier complex
hydrocarbon compounds into lighter fuel through
the employment of heat, pressure, etc. . . .
Oddiy enough, this spot in Santa Fe Springs was
a historic place. Crude as our plant looked, it
was still the first oil cracking plant in the world.
From this small beginning all of the major oil
companies received franchises for cracking plants
around the globe.

"It is with pride and satisfaction that Wendell
and I look back, knowing we contributed considerably 
to the development of a process so important
to transportation throughout the world. Nor would
<span id="page-786"></span>
we have been there except for father's procuring
the job for us. After four months the process
rights were sold. We got our pay but lost our
jobs."

Pulling together has lifted many a load, and
so it was with the A. B. Christensen family. It
was soon able to move to more desirable quarters
in Salt Lake City, at 1876 South Main Street. This
was to become an eventful site in the lives of the
children. It was in the Farmer's Ward and there
was a wonderful group of young people affiliated
there, including Nancy Howells and Mary Pratt,
who later became the wives of Wendell and Sheldon
respectively. It was from this home and Ward that
both the boys left for missions to Germany, Wendell
in 1925 and Sheldon in 1926. Since the family finances
were still at rather low ebb, the boys were
helped mostly by profits from their mother's sewing.
It turned out that Wendell had the privilege of being
Sheldon's first District President in the mission
field. With their former experience in Germany
as children, the language was no problem for
either of them.

Sheldon returned home in June 1929. On 16
Sep. that same year, in the Salt Lake Temple, he
was married to Mary Urie Pratt (b. 10 Aug. 1907
in Farmington, Utah to Mathoni Wood and Agnes
Urie Pratt.) They became the parents of four sons
and have sent three of them on foreign missions for
the church, one to Denmark, once the home of the
Christensen's ancient Viking progenitors, one to
Uruguay and one to the French Mission from which
he has just returned (1969). Mary is serving as a
member of the General Board of the YWMIA, while
Sheldon himself has served in bishoprics, on Stake
missions, and in various other church assignments
over the years, both in California and Utah.

He has been successful in business. First
he worked for years as an independent insurance
broker, dealing largely with estate planning,
deferred insurance plans, pensions, profit
sharing, and life insurance as applied to corporations, 
estates and businesses, Eleven years ago
(1958) he went into the securities business and
organized a broker dealership which was qualified
<span id="page-787"></span>
with the Securities Exchange Commission, National
Association of Securities Dealers. He eventually
turned over this business to his son Neal and a
partner, who are operating it very successfully.
For the past four years Sheldon worked independently
in securities. Again last November he qualified as
a broker dealer in the securities business.

His work has taken him into California,
Idaho, Nevada and Utah where he has worked on
some very large accounts. He works directly with
businessmen at "face value" basis rather than on
a referral basis. This actually requires a great
deal of courage and skill on his part but he has
been rewarded with much success. He usually
goes in "cold turkey" as the expression goes, but
comes out with warm friendships and contracts.
He often takes "long shots in the dark", such as
the time he sent a strange businessman a check
for $100.00 along with a message that if the
receiver would give him enough of his time to
allow him to explain how he could save him thousands 
of dollars in his business, and was not convinced, 
he could keep the check. Sheldon received
an appointment, a good sized contract, and his
check back. This kind of selling not only takes
courage but also imagination and creative ability
as well as a convincing way with words.

Some years ago Sheldon took some time off
to study creative writing as an added tool in his
business. He applied his skill in writing "Life
Line", a sales presentation of which 50,000 printed
copies were sold; and in a series of eight articles
titled "You and Your Estate" which were published
in the Deseret News 1948/49. But his creative
writing has not been confined to business matters
only, by any means. He has published a novelette,
"The Bequest" and a short story in Look Magazine's
"My Favorite War Story" series. He tells of 
this:-- "While attending the Maren Elwood school of 
writing in downtown Hollywood during World War Il, a
poem was received from a sea captain who lost
his ship, depicting unusual bravery of a crew
member. The poem was offered for sale to class
members. Being an opportunist I bought it for 
$3.00, rewrote it in story form and submitted the
<span id="page-788"></span>
same to Mr. Gunther, west coast editor of Look
Magazine. The story was duly purchased and published. 
I still have the original poem."

Sheldon's face really lights up, however,
when he discusses his present creation, a full
length novel "Promise Me" a story of "Licit Love".
Incidental to the story is a full length tale of a 
conversion, a subtle by-product of the main plot. He
has been dreaming of and working on this novel for
some years and at present it is totally outlined and
with six chapters (10,000 words) completed. He
explains, "In addition to keeping kept-up with
family, church, business, ever current reading
as well as some television, I am in the throes of
a major literary undertaking which began a few
years ago and will likely extend through a number
of future anniversaries before publication. Herewith 
I feel my undivided, feeble efforts will be best
employed. I've given up hunting, fishing, and I
don't play golf. I love to walk and when I walk
alone my mind is completely occupied with words,
phrases, events, characterizations and a potpourri
of tales."

Sheldon, businessman, churchman and writer,
is the middle one of A. B. Christensen's three
living sons. He is not as large or tall as Wendell
and not as thin as Luther, but in looks he seems
to resemble his father much more than either of
the others. Perhaps his dreams are more like his
father's, for Andrew also had visions of writing,
and to get himself into a financial position to do so
he struggled and strove, though unsuccessfully, to
the end of his days. Perhaps he will succeed in
this through Sheldon, as he will succeed in others
of his dreams through his other children - who
knows now? We have no better glimpse of
Sheldon's sensitive nature and keen perception
than in the words he wrote of his father's 
death:-- "Father died alone in a modest hotel room in 
St. George. . . Traveling in the severe cold of that
December 1931, I arrived at St. George about fifteen 
hours after Father's passing. In the last
moments of his life, despite complications of
pneumonia and diabetes, still he bothered to wind
his inexpensive timepiece. I remember well, I
<span id="page-789"></span>
cried as I held the watch, knowing that as long as
it ticked a last bit of Father's tremendous energy
still remained. Whether he really died of a
broken heart or was mercifully taken in illness,
I do not know. But of one thing I am certain - there 
still remained an unsubdued determination
and dignity about him to the end. . . He possessed
the marked tendency to deny himself in his valiant
effort at reaching for the stars."

One time, when a group of us Christensen
cousins had met to discuss the writing of family
histories, Sheldon, among them, brought out the
point that he thought the bad should be mentioned
along with the good, and then he said something to
this effect, "If, after I die, someone writes my
history and 'flowers' it all up - I'll come back and
haunt them!" Now we have no fear of the dead
returning on such missions, but to arouse the ire
of the living is a problem we do not wish to encounter. 
It is thus with humility and some trembling
that we present this skeleton sketch of Sheldon,
who terms himself "something of a nut". We hope
that someday he will find time to "breathe the
breath of life" into a worthy history of his own.
Until then, however, he has left this 
testimony: -- "God has been kind to me. I have been 
blessed and preserved. I am grateful for the Gospel of
Jesus Christ and membership in His church. I
am cognizant of a wonderful heritage, wife, family,
brothers and sisters, etc., etc. . . Each year life
becomes more fascinating. Times have changed
since I was a boy, but I still love cooking over an
open fire and eating out of the fry pan."

## Ada Peterson

(26) Ada Peterson (6) was born 13 Jan. 1906
in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Her brother Byron
remembers her as very athletic as a girl and how
she could ride horses bareback as good as most
boys. He remembers she was the catcher on the
school baseball team. She was a sister after his
own heart and a good substitute for a brother, of
which he had none. They were great pals!

Ada writes of herself:-- "I attended grade
school, high school and Seminary in Gunnison. I
graduated from high school in 1926, having failed
to graduate with my own class of '25 due to mother's
illness. During these years I taught in Primary
and was Sunday School organist in Gunnison Ward
with Clyde C. Edmunds as chorister. I sang in the
Gunnison Ward choir under E. L. Swalberg. I sang
duets with Emily Knighton at church functions.

When Gunnison Ward was divided I served as Sunday
School Secretary in the new Hamilton Ward for some
years. I belonged to a double mixed quartet under
Charles E. Ferrie and we were in great demand for
church and civic affairs. In High School I belonged
to the Glee Club, sang in the opera and sang the
lead in a double mixed quartet in competition with
other schools. We always had a high rating. Our
music teacher was our beloved ElRay Christiansen,
now assistant to the Twelve Apostles.

"After I graduated from High School I worked
for the Gunnison Telluride Power Co. as 
steno-bookkeeper and stock clerk. It was here I met
Linden H. Johnson who was manager. We were
married 29 June 1928 in the Manti Temple. I
<span id="page-791"></span>
became stepmother to his two children, Francis
Dale and Helen Ramona, ages 8 and 5. (Linden
Hyrum Johnson was born 15 Sep. 1895 in Huntington, 
Emery, Utah to Swen Hyrum and Matilda
Wilhamina Nelson Johnson).

"We moved to Delta, Utah, May of 1930
where Lin established the Delta branch of the
Telluride Power Co. Here I worked in a greater
capacity, training new girls and continuing as
steno, etc. We lived in Delta twenty-five years
and during these years I worked and raised my
family. Lin's and my two children, Ada Bonita
and Larry Lynn, were both born in Delta. Dale
and Ramona both attended BYU until World War II
came and they volunteered - Dale in the Naval Air
and Mona as a WAVE.

"When Lin advanced to Supt. of the Delta
Division of Telluride Power Co., I assumed more
responsibility as hostess, working on the entertainment 
committees. Also I was active in church
and civic affairs. I attended the Delta 2nd Ward
where I was Sunday School Secretary, taught in
Sunday School, Primary, MIA, and was a Relief
Society visiting teacher. I sang with the 'Singing
Mothers' under Ladd Cropper and belonged to the
Ward choir. I sang as a soloist at funerals.
Aside from church activities I was secretary for
the American Legion Auxilliary for ten years, for
which I was awarded a silver necklace with the
American Legion emblem on it.

"Lin and I belonged to the Fidelity Club, a
social organization in which we made many lifelong
friends. It was composed of a distinguished group
of doctors, lawyers, our Stake president, Seminary
teacher, principal of Delta High School, Delta's
Mayor and fine people from all walks of life, sixteen
couples of fun-loving people, each with a purpose
in life. I entertained many times in our home
where I learned to be a hostess. At first I didn't
feel capable of this because I was ten years younger
than most and lacked the maturity and experience.
My excuse up until we built our new home was
always that our place wasn't large enough. However, 
when lovely Romania Bird said, 'Ada dear,
where there is heart room there is house room'. I
<span id="page-792"></span>
needed no more assurance - our new home became
a center of festivities, I could seat thirty-six people
at card tables and we had many lovely parties.
Bonita celebrated her fourteenth birthday there
before leaving for California to study dance at
Hollywood Professional School ('53-'56) which one
hundred of her classmates attended. In 1948 the
Fidelity Club celebrated its 25th anniversary in
our home with fifty guests in attendance. There
were many happy times during our stay in Delta.

"In October of 1955 I left Delta for California
to take on a new role as a guest home operator. I
called my place 'Ada's Guest Home, a home away
from home'. One year later Lin and Larry followed,
after having sold our beautiful home and furnishings
in Delta. The home at 440 South Oxford in Los
Angeles was our home for seven years. It was a
two-story mansion. An apartment sized kitchen,
dining room, bedroom and bath were our personal
quarters adjacent to the main home of a kitchen
and pantry, beautiful dining area, living room, and
a winding oak staircase leading to five king-size
bedrooms for our guests, along with two bedrooms
and a maid's room downstairs. There was a separate
building of room and bath with picturesque
windows, which became Bonita's music studio.

"It was while living here that I received my
license for six ambulatory guests and with the
help of my maid Dessie, a colored woman from
the south, achieved an A-1 rating my first year,
which I have continued to receive. I have always
set a beautiful table for three meals a day with
good food. I have cared for both men and women,
although most of my guests have been women. At
440 So. Oxford I cared for motion picture people
until they built the motion picture country home.
Each one had a story to tell. When they came to
my home they stopped using tobacco and drinking
became a thing of the past for them. Those were
very happy and interesting days for all of us. The
Lord was good to me.

"When we sold that home to a builder we
moved across the street to 431 So. Oxford, where
we are now. We watched them tear down a home
we loved, along with a redwood tree for which Mary
<span id="page-793"></span>
Pickford at one time had offered $150.00 but had
been refused by the previous owner. At 431 Oxford
I still have my guests and a cook and housekeeper.
At present my youngest guest is 75 and my eldest
93. My cook has been with me seven years. She
is from Tennessee and her name is Thelma Joyce.
She is a real dear. Bonita too has worked with
me these last years, and because her disposition
is much like mine, the guests have all loved her
as well. Her singing and playing of the piano have
been appreciated by them also. Her health is now
the best she has ever known, since an early back
injury caused her years of pain and illness.

"When our guests demanded more personal
care we bought or rented three different homes,
one in North Hollywood, where Bonita and Larry
enjoyed the swimming pool, and two in Encino,
Calif., about twenty minutes drive from our place
in Los Angeles. The family home at present is at
409 So. Oxford Ave., where Bonita, who is now 
married and has a baby daughter, lives along with
Lin and me. Our son Larry and family live in
Orem, Utah, where he serves as assistant cashier
at Orem State Bank, after having graduated from
Hollywood High School with high honors and also
from Seminary there and later attending BYU in
Provo, where he met his lovely wife.

"Lin operated a Standard service station
here for ten years, for which he was awarded a
bronze plaque. He retired in Aug. 1968 and has
recently undergone two separate operations at the
Veterans' Hospital, Wilshire and Sawtelle blvd.,
one for a hernia and one for hemorrhoids. He was
released Mar. 15 and is now feeling fine and grateful 
to have this over with. The Elders were there
and administered each time. He has been my
painter, plumber and all-around handy man over
these last years. What would I have done without
him?

"We are members of Wilshire Ward, where
Lin is a High Priest and very active. Even though
I can't attend regularly, I'm there in spirit and
keep up my tithes and offerings, as the Lord has
blessed me financially. When I needed guests he
has provided. I have not had a sick day in the
<span id="page-794"></span>
thirteen years of my business. For this I am
grateful and humble. I always have a prayer in
my heart for strength to meet my obligations, and
they are many when you care for ten old people on
an average every day three hundred and sixty-five
days a year. Oh my, I could write a book on the
beautiful people I've served through these years.

"In closing I'd like to copy the words on a
thank you note from the daughter of an LDS lady
I once cared for:- 'Dear Sister Johnson, It has
been an inspiring experience to know you and I
appreciate all you have done for mother. It is
thrilling to know that the spirit you carry is the
one we shall all share in the celestial kingdom and
our associations will continue there. It was God's
blessing that we were led to you and may we enjoy
always the sweet spirit that is expressed in your
home. Sincerely, Cecilia Jensen.'"

## Myron Ellis Christensen

(27) Myron Ellis Christensen (3) was born
Sun. 4 Mar. 1906 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in
the family home in the west part of town, which is
<span id="page-795"></span>
still standing today. He was christened Ellis
Myron but later changed his name to the above
arrangement. His only brother then living, Harold,
was ten years older than he, so his closest companion 
in the home was his sister Ruth Ellen, some
three-and-a-half years older; they have been great
friends ever since.

When he was in his teens his parents moved
from the home of his birth to a farm they owned
near Rocky Point, west of Gunnison, where he
helped his father feed lambs and with the farm
work. He attended grade and high school in
Gunnison, graduating from the latter. It was a
long walk from Rocky Point to school and seemed
especially so in the cold of the winter. But in spite
of it, or perhaps a little because of it, Myron grew
to be a tall, strong, healthy youth capable of a lot
of hard work. He received excellent training in
farm and livestock management from his father and
set his heart on acquiring a good farm of his own
someday.

His father died in the small farm house near
Rocky Point, 23 July 1926, when Myron was four
months past twenty, leaving him as his mother's
main source of help and strength. Harold and Ruth
had long since married and made their own homes.
His three younger brothers, one nineteen and the
others going on fifteen and ten, were a lot of help,
especially the two oldest who had undergone a lot
of farm training and were also big fellows and
capable,

Myron at the time was courting. One evening 
at a roller skating rink in Manti, Utah (Felts
Pavillion), about four years before he had met a
Manti girl named Delida Jensen (b. 23 June 1907
in Sterling, Utah to William and Maria Louella
Peterson Jensen). A friendship had begun that
night which had lasted those several years, during
which time Myron had made hundreds of trips to
Manti in all kinds of weather. Nearly nine months
after his father's death, Myron and Delida ("Dee")
contracted a civil marriage in Manti, 13 Apr. 1927.
Myron's mother and three brothers soon moved to
Fayette, Utah to live with her recently widowed
brother, Uncle Henry Bartholomew, and assist in
<span id="page-796"></span>
caring for his motherless children.

Dee takes up the story from here:-- "Myron
and I took up farming in Clarion, Utah (near Gunnison)
and farmed there until Delta City took the
water rights away. After leaving Clarion we moved
to Gunnison for awhile and then we got the opportunity 
to come to Genola, Utah to work for G. H.
Chaffin on his ranch. This was during the severe
depression of the 30's. Myron worked on the
Chaffin ranch for ten years and then bought a farm
of his own in the Genola area where our family still
lives. We have five living children and one died at
birth. The five are all married now and have children
of their own, so Myron and I live on the farm
alone and still work hard. But we travel quite a
lot in our car and always go on at least one big
trip each year, most usually in late fall or winter
when the farm work can be left alone for awhile.
We have been to the Northwest, Mexico, and numerous 
times to California where we almost always
drop in on Ruth Ellen and her family in San Diego.
This winter we took Myron's brother Marvin and
his wife Lois with us to Ruth Ellen's. We enjoyed
ourselves there. The last trip his brother Harold
took before he died was with us to San Diego. We
love to travel. We go fishing a lot too, for Myron
loves to fish.

"The winter of 1967 was a hectic one for us.
My mother passed away and Myron was laid up with
the gout in his foot. This was pretty tough for a
farmer. Then our son's year old boy was in the
hospital with spinal meningitis and was very sick,
though he finally responded to the medication.
Grandma Dee had the four year old to care for
during his baby brother's illness. Generally we
have good health and should not complain, but we
too are getting old like the rest of you. But we
enjoy life a lot.

"While in Goshen, Myron has been a member
and one time president of the White Lake Riding
Club. He was also employed by the Strawberry
Highline Canal Co. here for eleven years. At
present, besides operating his own farm, he is
employed on the large church farm at Elberta,
Utah, not far from our place, and has been for
<span id="page-797"></span>
several years. Looking forward to retirement,
Myron just sold part of his farm and bought himself
a boat so he can go fishing in style."

## Rex Christensen

(28) Rex Christensen (7) was born 10 Mar.
1906 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the old Wasden
home across south from the home of his Christensen
grandparents. When he was seven days old his 
parents thought he was dying. They called the
Elders in to give him a name and a blessing and
he recovered, but that is the reason, his mother
said, that he had only one given name. 

When he was yet very young the family
moved to a ranch a mile or so west of Gunnison
into a rather poorly equipped farm house there.
The ranch belonged to his father's brother Albert.
Rex was indeed a sickly baby and had some very
severe spells when he would hemorrhage from the
nose. His father was often away with the sheep.
His sister LaFaun says that their mother, often
alone on the ranch except for her three small
children, pulled baby Rex through a number of
bad sick spells with her faith and prayers. She
<span id="page-799"></span>
remembers how her mother knelt by his cradle to
pray and how she rocked him in her arms hour
after hour in the rocking chair to soothe him 
singing a plaintive lullaby. Many mothers had a
hard time raising all their children to maturity in
those days. Rex's little brother Spencer, who
came along right after him, only lived a few weeks.

Not long before Rex turned three, his father
bought his grandparents' big rock house, across
from where he was born in northwest Gunnison,
and moved the family into it. It was here that he
lived the next seven years of his life. It was from
here that he went to the Gunnison district school
for several years - it was but a few blocks from
this home. It was from here that he left Gunnison
when he was just six days past ten, together with
others of his family, to go to Wyoming and live on
a ranch his father had homesteaded, being part of
the acreage taken up by several members of his
father's family several miles from the town of
Lyman and which they called "The Oasis".

Rex eventually grew to be a strong, strapping
and very handsome fellow. In 1929 in Ogden, Utah,
he married Marcella Richardson, daughter of Walter
and Stella Richardson. They had one son but separated
when the child was about two years old.
Rex married second, 29 Nov. 1932 in Lyman,
Wyoming, Ina Mae Packham (b. 23 Aug. 1903 in
Pleasant View, Utah, to John and Lydia Kent 
Packham). They had two daughters. Ina died of a
serious illness 10 Mar. 1942 in Ogden, leaving
Rex with the two little girls. On 27 Oct. 1943 in
Ogden, Rex married his third wife, Mabel Patterson 
(b. 23 Jan. 1924 in Ogden to David Earl and
Dora Miller Patterson). They became the parents
of two sons.

For many of his last years he suffered with
emphysema, a malfunction or disease of the lungs
and reported to be the fastest growing disease in
the world today. He was unable to do any heavy
work. Mabel, a very lovely, kind and patient
person, took care of him and also went to work to
support the family. Rex passed away at their home
in Ogden 29 Sep. 1968 and was buried in Ogden Cemetery 
2 Oct. His wife and five children survived
<span id="page-800"></span>
him, as well as a number of grandchildren and
brothers and sisters.

Mabel has written of him and we quote:- "Rex had 
brown hair, brown eyes, a fair complexion
and an even temper. I found him very easy to get
along with. Everyone he met seemed to like him
right away. As a man he had very good health up
until the last dozen years when he developed
emphysema. He was an avid fisherman. I have
seen him catch fish when others around him couldn't
even get a bite. He loved the outdoors and said he
felt a closeness to his Creator when on a stream or
in the hills. He recalled many summers of hard
work on the ranch in Wyoming with his father and
brother Lucien. He attended school both in Lyman
and Evanston, Wyoming. He was a boxer in his
high school years and at one time won the Golden
Glove tournament in his area.

"When Rex was just past nineteen he was
called to serve a mission for the church in New
Zealand. He had his endowment 2 Apr. 1925 and
left the mission home shortly afterwards, traveling
by train to Vancouver, Canada and then by boat
from there. He returned by boat to San Francisco
in 1928, the boat trip having taken nineteen days
each way. While on his mission he had appendicitis
and later on pneumonia. He said only the faith of
the Elders and the grace of God saved his life on
those occasions. He loved the time he spent on
his mission and he loved the Maori people. Occasionally 
he commented on how eager these people
were to help the Elders.

"Once at a Conference there President McKay,
then an Apostle, was in attendance. Afterwards,
outside, there was an intoxicated man who was
angry with the Mormons for some reason or another.
All worked up in his anger, he approached Brother
McKay and challenged him to a fight. He raised his
fists to strike the great Apostle who stood there
calmly, saying not a word but just looking at him
in pity with those piercing eyes of his. As suddenly
as he had raised his fists, the enraged man fell to
his knees sobbing and asking forgiveness. Rex
said this incident helped to increase the testimonies
of the other people who were present - and also his own.
<span id="page-801"></span>

"Rex had lived in Ogden ever since he
returned from his mission in New Zealand in 1928,
except for one year in The Dalles, Oregon, where
his second wife, Ina, became ill with a brain tumor
and they returned to Ogden to be near her family,
and the six months he and I and the family lived in
Redlands, Calif, in 1950.

"He was a good husband and father. A
couple of years before his death we attended
'Project Temple' together and on June 22, 1967
he took me and our sons to the Logan Temple to
be sealed to him for all eternity. Though we miss
him so much we realize he is better off where he
is. I am now interested in getting his genealogy
together, as well as my own."

## Clifton Christensen Bartholomew 

(29) Clifton Christensen Bartholomew (5)
according to the account of him in his mother's
Book of Remembrance: "was born 24 Nov. 1906
in Fayette, Sanpete, Utah. He was blessed there
by his grandfather, Bishop John Bartholomew. The
following spring his parents bought a large new
brick home in Gunnison, Utah (1907) where they
moved when he was but a few months old.

"At age six Clifton entered the Gunnison
public school. On his eighth birthday, 24 Nov.
1914, he was baptized by Joseph W. Vickers in
the Manti Temple and was confirmed the same day
and place by Martin Jenson. When he was four
months past nine he left Gunnison by train, along
with his mother and brothers and sisters, for
Lyman, Wyoming and settled on a ranch six miles
east living there in summers and attending school
in winters for the next two years. In the spring of
1918 he moved with his parents and family to
Ogden, Utah. Here, aside from attending school,
etc., he mowed lawns for people and sacked kindlings
at the kindling factory. He returned to
Lyman, Wyoming for the next school year (1919/20)
and then went to Goshen, Utah with the family the
spring of 1920, living on the Boswell farm two
miles south of Goshen. He finished Jr. High School
<span id="page-803"></span>
in Goshen and then went by bus to Payson, Utah
where he attended High School.

"Clifton was ordained a Deacon in the church
1 Apr. 1919 by William Spangenberg in Ogden, and
a Teacher 25 Mar. 1923 by Robert E. Finch in
Goshen. On 24 Apr. 1926 he left for Florida and
worked in electrical work until Sep. 1927. After
a short interval at home he started to work for the
Power and Light Company around Austin and Round
Rock, Texas, and stayed there until about July 1928.
He then worked for the Bingham Canyon Copper
mine till December that same year and then went
back to Texas, working around Ft. Worth and Waco
for the Texas Power and Light and Texas Electric
Service Company. In October of 1929 he was
working at El Paso, Texas for the El Paso Electric
Co. From there he went to Merida, Yucatan,
Mexico, and worked there until September of the
next year. During the year 1931 he worked for
Walker Mine in California, then in 1932 went to
work at Boulder Dam. Later he worked for Tintic
Standard Mine near Dividend, Utah, and then for
Utah Power and Light Co. in Provo Canyon and
Park City. In 1936 he worked at Pioche and Las
Vegas, Nevada, until just before getting married
to Rhea Wilson. After this he went to work for an
electric company in California, living at various
places such as Montebello, Alpine and Whittier."

Clifton wrote a bit about himself and we
quote:-- "In 1926 my brother Edgar and I went to
Miami, Florida, to work for a power company.
We were there in the hurricane of Sep. 1926 when
so many lives were lost and so much damage
occurred. After about 18 months in Florida we
went to Texas where we worked for a Texas utility
company that was building lines to service a large
oil pipeline going to the Eastern States. Two years
later we went to Merida, Yucatain, Mexico, to
work for the Electric Bond and Share Co. until the
depression stopped all work there. I worked on
the Hoover (Boulder) Dam while it was being built.

"I married Rhea Hazel Wilson of Payson, the
girl from across the street, 17 June 1937 in Salt
Lake City, Utah. (She was born 7 Nov. 1913 in
Eureka, Utah to Robert Henry and Zelpha Nisonger
<span id="page-804"></span>
Wilson). We went to Los Angeles, Calif. where I
went to work for the Southern California Edison
Company. During World War II I went with Lockheed 
Overseas Corporation to Ireland where we
stationed at an Air Force base in Northern Ireland
near Belfast (July 1943-July 1944). In Aug. 1944
I went back to work for the Edison Company, this
time in Redlands, Calif., where I have worked for
the past twenty-four-and-a-half years."

In December 1945 Clifton and Rhea moved
into their own home at 812 Sherwood St., Redlands,
Calif., where they still reside. At last report Rhea
was serving as a counselor in the Relief Society
presidency of their Ward. She says she is having
problems tracing her genealogy. They have no
descendants.

## Everette Hale Christensen

(30) Everett Hale Christensen (4) was born
12 Mar. 1907 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He was
named and blessed 2 June 1907 by Niels R. Petersen; 
baptized 31 Aug. 1915 by Andrew Christensen
(no relation); confirmed the same day by Andrew
Thomson Jr. and ordained a Deacon 8 Nov. 1920
by Joseph H. Carpenter - all in Manti.

I remember him as a round faced, tow
headed little fellow whose hair was rather hard to
manage - a typical Christensen youngster, who
grew to look more like our father than any other
of his sons, though never quite as tall. He was
more modest than us other children and had such
a sweet, gentle disposition. He was so easy to
get along with and I always had a motherly feeling
towards him and tried to take his part in the little
family squabbles that inevitably take place among
children, even in the best of households.

We catch glimpses of him as a lad between
his fourth and eighth years, as mother saw him,
for she jotted these accounts down in her journal:

"Sunday morning Aug. 20, 1911 - I was
sitting out on the porch a few moments ago watching
Sherman and Hale. They were by the fence gathering 
the pink hollyhocks. Hale had on his little white
suit and their white heads looked beautiful to me
<span id="page-805"></span>
there among the flowers. . . Sep. 18, 1911 - School 
starts this morning. Hale and I are alone.
He has on his little yellow suit which looks just
the color of his hair. . . Oct. 18, 1911 - Hale is
off somewhere playing. Well, it is good that he
can be gathering some of the gold from this lovely
October weather to last him through the short,
dark winter days. . . June 19, 1912 - Just got
through making Hale a waist, and Hale and Sherman
have been worrying me about making them some
flags. (Hale went off without his flag)... Across
the road I see Hale leading Reid's dog. Lucian is
playing the drum and they are all singing. I know
that Sherman is just outside longing for his flag so
that he can join them in their parade. . . July 8,
1912 - I just got through making a cake. Sherman
and Hale went to the grocery for the bananas. I
emptied the mixing bowl and there ensued a wrangle
between them over which was going to scrape the
bowl. I had to draw a line through the center and
each took a side of the bowl to scrape as they sat
on the floor. 'Don't pound the bowl, Hale!'. . .
Nov. 18, 1912 - There the children lie, Sherman
with his feet in Hale's side; Hale with his little
red face and tangled white hair. The children
take almost every moment of the day. Hale has
been so trying. He lets out some of the biggest
yells for a little fellow lever heard. I suppose
the passing years will lend luster to those yells
which now annoy me and turn them to music.
May 16, 1913 - A show of great importance is
taking place at Margaret's this afternoon. Hale,
delighted with the prospects of being an actor,
hastened through his dinner. Five minutes ago
he came aimlessly walking home. 'Why Hale, why
aren't you over at the show?' I asked. 'I won't be
in it,' he said. 'They dressed me up like a girl
and were going to make me be the cook. The dress
was ugly, with a yellow string on it'. He stands
here now. 'There they go' he just said. 'All the
kids are going. That's Arthur running across now.
They think it's such a grand show, but they just
have a little stubby tent!' (This with great 
disdain). . . Sherman, at the show, is dressed like
a Captain, while Reva, Virginia and Elaine have
their dancing dresses on, Hale absolutely refuses
<span id="page-806"></span>
to go over. I just gave him an egg to spend if he
would go over to Uncle Fred's store and get me a
spool of thread. . . May 17, 1914 - The water was
running down badly and filling the hollow just south
of the apricot tree. I told Hale I would give him
an egg if he would go up to the corner and turn it
off. Sherman said he would. They both went, as
did Phil. They each took an egg and went to the
Sugar Bowl to buy candy. . . Here they are now,
happy with their purchases. They are treating
me with candy."

Hale was nine years and four-and-a-half
months old when Mother died. After that, although
Aunt Vena, then Aunt Retta, then others came to
help in the home and finally Aunt Myrtle as a
second mother, yet he spent as much time as
possible with his father and on the various 
ranches - Gunnison, Flat Canyon and Star (for a short
time). He took responsibility readily and was a hard
worker and most dependable with the farm work.
Yet his mind seemed of a mechanical bent and he
became particularly interested in radio. Bert
Gledhill, once a foreman on the Gunnison ranch,
remembers Hale's aerial wires and antennas being
strung in every direction there on the ranch, from
the farmhouse to the granary and even to one of
the big barns, as he experimented with electromagnetic
waves.

I recall spending part of New Years Eve with
Hale in the "Buff Room" upstairs in our home in
Manti the year end following my marriage (1923).
A radio he had constructed was set up in the east
window with wires going every which way both
inside and out. He tried to explain to me the
principles upon which it worked and we took turns
wearing the attached ear phones, as he tuned into
the festivities in New York, Chicago and other
distant cities as the New Year arrived there. I
had never experienced radio before and to me it
seemed like a miracle. Hale had great ambitions
along this line.

After the family moved to Orem and he graduated 
from High School, Father then being in the
midst of a financial struggle, Hale got employment
with a General Land Office survey, Ralph Gentry
<span id="page-807"></span>
engineer. Though Father wanted him to start
college the next winter, Hale, always most considerate 
and mindful of Father and others, decided
against it, as excerpts from some of his letters at
that period show:-- "Kamas, Sept. 24, '27 - Dear
Dad: Just a line to let you know I'm all right. We
are going to move from here on the first of October,
maybe sooner if the snow drives us out. I suppose
our next camp will be in the Ophir country. Two
of the fellows have quit. . . Ophir, Ut. Oct. 
28, '27 - Dear Dad: I have been keeping notes on the rear
end of the chain for the last month and am doing all
right. The work gets tiresome at times, but I
suppose it's all for the best. I must try to save
enough money this year to buy me some clothes
and to start my radio business going. I want so
much to help out all I can. . . I'm not going to
school this year Dad. I am going to build radio
sets, etc. I will not have to carry any overhead
expense, just keep enough parts on hand to fill
orders. In addition to this I am going to take a
drafting course from the American School. This
is a complete course in general drafting. Then
they give you a specialized course in one of five
branches, mechanical, architectural, structural,
electronic or automobile drafting, and guarantee
you a job on completion of the course. It looks
like a good layout and I know I can make it. What
do you think of it?"

Though father thought that Hale would have
done better to have entered school, he did not. He
came home in time for the holiday season in Orem
and began taking an interest in some of the young
people there, although his heart was set on a girl
in Manti with whom he had kept company before
leaving there. He corresponded with Ada regularly
and began to think some of marriage. Sherman,
himself married and away attending law school in
Washington, D. C., encouraged him in this but
Father, though he didn't say much about it to Hale
since it was his habit to let his children make their
own decisions as they grew older, felt that he would
be better off to get as well prepared as possible for
his life's work beforehand. In a letter to Sherman
dated Mar. 4, 1928, Father wrote, "I don't know
just what Hale will do this summer. He talks like
<span id="page-808"></span>
he intends to go on the survey again. If he does I
want to be able to help him out so that he can go to
school next year. I believe I will encourage him
to go to Logan and take an engineering course. He
is taking a course by correspondence in drafting
but he is working at that under quite a disadvantage.
He will do fine in his line if he can get well prepared.
I am going to make every effort to have him take a
complete course so that he can get where he would
like to."

Hale's drafting outfit came and he tried to
keep more or less employed with that during the
winter. He also advertized as having a "parts
installing service" and "radio sets" and got a little
business along that line. As spring approached he
helped on the place, pruning the trees, etc. His
twenty-first birthday, Mar, 12, 1928, was celebrated 
by a supper prepared by Aunt Myrtle in her
usual efficient manner and attended by several of
his young men friends. But he did not seem entirely
satisfied with life and wanted to "reach out" for
something better. Nevertheless he didn't complain.

Among the letters Hale wrote at that time was
one dated Mar. 20, 1928 to his brother Sherman.
From this we quote:- "It's a beautiful spring
morning. . . Things are coming along all right on
the farm; lots of work as you may know. We haven't
started to put the crops in as yet but we are preparing
the land for same in husbandlike manner. Things
are surely getting beautiful around these parts,
everything getting green, and ummmm - spring is
in the air (as everything and everybody is hauling
manure).

"I went into town last night with Waldo Harris
and his brother. On the way home we ran out of gas
and had to push the big Studabaker up the last hill
and last lap. Waldo walked home with me and as
luck would have it we met a couple of Provo girls
I knew and they had underestimated their supply of
the midnight oil also. But after looking into the
tank we found plenty of the said necessary gasoline
and proceeded to play mechanics on their Chevrolet.
We had much trouble in agreeing as to the ailment
of the lemon. Waldo tore into the gas line and I
into the ignition and very soon we had all the loose
<span id="page-809"></span>
parts on the car entirely loosened and thrown off
to the side. Oh, how we worked - without any success.
Finally, as an afterthought, we deemed it a
good idea to put the car together again. Oy yoy yoy!
It just couldn't be done - too many parts. However
we did get things bolted on, etc., but it looked like
a very untidy trash pile instead of a car. After
going as far as we had, we decided to play the
gallant Romeos and began taking our walking and
pushing exercises toward Provo. The rest is
short. We hailed a car which acted as a tug. We
then made our graceful exit - I hope.

"Will you look up the requirements of taking
the Civil Service examination for draftsman?
Waldo and I are figuring on coming to Washington
next fall. Waldo wants to take up law. We would
like to start studying on something which would
help us to find employment in Washington. I suppose 
I'll go surveying again this year if I can get
out with Gentry. I have already got that hillish
feeling. Love to all. Hale."

Hale wrote another letter to Sherman 5 Apr.
1928, from which we quote excerpts:- "All things
in general are beginning to look like spring, and
we are surely thankful as we have been having
bum, windy weather for two months. The berries,
peaches, apricots and cherries are beginning to
bloom, making the valley look like a huge garden.
The sweet smell of spring is in the air. This has
its effects. Gives one the hankering to go to the
mountains surveying. Yep, I want to go on the
survey again this year. Took a little trip to Salt
Lake last week to see Gentry. He advised me that
the surveyors wouldn't be going out until about the
first of July. This is due to the government's lack
of funds.

"I am plugging along in my drafting and hope
in the future to find my reward. Are there many
ads in the Washington papers advertising for
draftsman? I suppose, however, there will be a
job for me as soon as I'm prepared. I wish I could
do something to help Dad right now. Of course I
am farming every day, which helps in the long run,
but our finances at present although not the worst
could be better. They are bound to be afterwhile.
<span id="page-810"></span>
Things get discouraging at times but I suppose I
shouldn't kick as Dad bears the brunt of everything."

Besides working on the farm and around the
place that spring, Hale worked at the Cold Packing
Plant in Orem going on shift from before noon to
nearly midnight. He was doing all he could to help
out. On the farm he often sang at his work. He
had a beautiful high tenor voice and was a member
of a male quartet in the community. He loved
music and the other arts - the finer things of life.
He loved people, animals, and of course the
beauties of nature. And he loved life, being on
the threshhold of full manhood. What a pity when
such a one is cut down in the midst of such promise
and hope for the future.

That very spring Hale began ailing, as a letter
from Father written June 26, 1928 advises:- "We
are all well excepting Hale. I had him to Salt Lake
a few days last week trying to find out the matter.
The x-ray expert took a number of pictures but
thus far we have not been satisfied as to what is
the trouble, which seems to be in his bowels. I
am taking him up there again in the morning. We
do not wish to operate until we discover the trouble
if possible from the outside. It is quite a worry
and the poor boy is about discouraged. Gentry
called him the other day and wanted him to go out
with his party but of course he couldn't. Gentry
said, however, that he would hold a job open for
him for a month or two. We are hoping for the best,"

Hale failed to improve. An operation July 30,
1928, though quite serious did not reveal an expected
growth in the large intestines yet it was a great
shock to his system. His condition gave much
cause for concern. Though he was able to return
home from the hospital at that time and seemed to
feel some better yet he was in constant pain and
had a very hard time of it. He took some treatments
to stimulate the nerves controlling the colon
activity, where the trouble seemed to be located,
and did all else that the doctors thought might help.
Nothing helped and he was operated on again, Oct.
15, 1928 in the Salt Lake LDS Hospital, requiring
blood transfusions because of his frail condition.
<span id="page-811"></span>

They found that part of his large intestine
had become enmeshed with a large, hard growth
almost completely closing it off. Much inflamation 
had occurred which had affected some of the
small intestines. He suffered most severe pain.
The doctors had to leave part of the large intestine
on the outside so that the affected part could sluff
off, and also leave his side open so that it could
drain. Later the large intestine was opened so
that it could drain through the side of the abdomen.
Though this brought some improvement and hope,
it was only temporary.

Hale wrote what is thought to be his last
letter, lying on his back in bed in the hospital
where he was suffering terribly. This is the 
letter:- "Dec. 13, 1928 - Dearest Dad in all the
world: Today is your birthday and I wish you all
the happiness and joy in the world, Oh, I am
thankful for a father like you even if I haven't
shown it. It's been my ambition to become as big
and respected a man as you are; always thinking
of others, sacrificing, bringing joy wherever you
go. Words cannot express how I feel and my love
for you.

"I hope you are all over your cold and feeling
fine. And I hope you have been successful in your
cases. I have been feeling better lately and my
spirits are high. Well, dear Dad, give my love
to Aunt Myrtle and the children and everybody.
Daddy I love you, Your loving son - Hale."

In a letter to Sherman Dec. 24, 1928, Father
told of preparations for Hale's last 
Christmas:- "Aunt Myrtle and I came up Saturday to do what
we could to give Hale a little Christmas cheer.
Aunt Myrtle went home yesterday and I will go
home today and we will all come up to see him
tomorrow. The folks here are all doing what they
can to cheer him. Some young people, girls and
boys from the Bench, came up yesterday and
brought him a beautiful bouquet of roses, and
other tokens. Gentry also came and spent some 
time with him and brought him a present. Aunt
Retta and family brought a beautiful Christmas
tree all decorated. And so with these and other .
flowers and presents coming in, his room has been
<span id="page-812"></span>
given a real Christmas appearance. The folks
here will bring presents this evening and try to
give Hale as pleasant a Christmas Eve as possible.
We should like to be here, but Hale wants us to have
our usual Christmas Eve at home for the children's
sake. He says he will certainly be there in thoughts,
and then we will come up tomorrow, children and all.

"Hale has been the most wonderful spirit
through all this long suffering and still keeps his
sweet disposition. He is a favorite and the nurses
all really love him and seek to do everything for
him possible. . . The awful reality of his not being
able to get well is forcing itself upon us in spite of
our great hopes and constant prayers. I feel that
Hale too realizes the situation and is making a
valiant fight to keep us hoping and to save us from
the terrible shock. . . If ever a man has proved
himself worthy of the highest respect and admiration 
under the most trying conditions and suffering,
that one is our Hale. And through it all it has
seemed that his greatest concern has been for
us. . . Well, if he must go, his young life and
character will be an inspiration to all of us to
achieve nobility of character and real success.
I always thought that Hale had the making of a fine
man, and the test that has come to him has proved
him worthy of a place among the glorified."

Sherman came from Washington shortly after
the holidays and spent a week with Hale. It was a
reunion and a farewell for two devoted brothers,
with smiles hiding heartbreak, one on the threshold
of full manhood and success - the other smitten and
wilting in his hospital bed. When and where are
decisions of such distinction made?

Cancer is a vicious and unmerciful foe. Hale
suffered on, as revealed in others of father's letters
written at intervals to Sherman:- "Jan, 29, 1929 -
I just came from the hospital where I have been
visiting Hale all day. The wonderful fight he is
making must challenge our admiration and we can
hardly think of him losing the fight. Dr. Andrew
said tonight he is a most wonderful patient and it
is almost more than he as a doctor can stand to
see Hale so courageous and find himself helpless
to help him. . . Feb, 13 - Hale is in very great
<span id="page-813"></span>
distress. It seems like the poor, dear boy must
suffer all the torture that a human being can endure.
Gentry was up here this evening but Hale couldn't
talk to him; he was under the influence of morphine.
We are doing everything we can for him but it is
very little we can do it seems. . . Feb. 20 - We
are all well with the exception of Hale. He is very
poorly, having much pain and is getting very weak.
He has eaten scarcely anything for three weeks.
Still he is that gentle, loving, appreciative soul,
scarcely ever complaining evenin his pain.
Feb. 25 - I have been here with Hale the greater
part of this week. The way he has acted during
this terrible sickness has not only been a wonder
but a great inspiration. While my heart bleeds for
him continually, I cannot help but be most proud
of him."

Hale passed away the morning of Mar. 9,
1929. A letter written that same day by his
brother Phillip to loved ones in Washington D. C.
is quoted here:- "It's a wonderful brother that is
gone to a better world. I am thankful that I have
had the opportunity and blessing of knowing him as
I have. It will help me be a much better person.
He would have made a wonderful person to carry
on our work here. . . I'm no flowery writer but I
surely feel that Hale is filling a purpose by doing
what he has done. I feel that back in the other
world Hale volunteered to do this thing that he has
done for some deep object and that his age enabled
him to see it through. . ."

And Father wrote:- "Hale's was a wonderful
struggle to win health again, but it could not be. 
While my judgment had been convinced for some
time that he could not recover, my feelings
remained unconvinced to the last day. But his
last day's struggle was such that I could not desire
him to continue the fight longer. He remained conscious 
until about the last, although his fever was
about up to 107 and he had been given about 28
grains of morphine during the last day and night. 
Hale was a real hero through it all and while I
should gladly have given what was left of my days
to have him spared, yet I feel a comfort and pride
in the way he bore his cross throughout this terrible
<span id="page-814"></span>
ordeal. . . That boy has shown himself worthy to
a glorious place on the other side. . . He will be
another there whose spirit will plan and pray for
our welfare and will be happy to greet us when our
work here is done. May it be as fearlessly and
nobly done as his. . . I am sure Hale's wonderful
life, though short, will be an aid and inspiration to
us all and another star of hope to guide us over any
perilous places we may encounter along life's
highway. He will always occupy an honored place
in our family group." 

Funeral services were held for Hale on his
twenty-second birthday, Tue. 12 Mar. 1929,
beginning at high noon. A local newspaper carried
this account:- "Orem Youth is Buried - Impressive
funeral services for Hale Christensen, son of A. H.
Christensen, who died Saturday morning were held
in the Timpanogos Ward chapel Tuesday afternoon.
Bishop James H. Clark presided. Miss Thera Lou
Olsen and Mrs. S. D. Wilstead rendered the vocal
duet 'Prayer Perfect' and the invocation was
offered by M. A. Rowley. Miss Olsen sang 'When
Roses Bloom'. The speakers were J. B. Keeler,
Hyrum S. Harris and Arthur V. Watkins. Miss
Inez Holdaway and Miss Virginia Taylor furnished
the vocal duet 'One Fleeting Hour' and the solo, 'In
My father's House are Many Mansions' was
rendered by Miss Myrle Perkins. As a closing
number a quartet consisting of Ivan Pyne, John
Shepherd, Mrs. Daphne Loveless, and Mrs. Lucy
Poulson sang 'Rest for the Weary Soul'. James C.
Jensen pronounced the benediction. The services
were well attended and the floral tributes were
many and beautiful. The body was taken to Manti
where short services were held and interment made."

A number of friends and many of our Snow
relatives accompanied our family from Orem to the
Manti Cemetery, as well as Uncle Charles Peterson
and Byron. We arrived there about 5:15 p.m. and
although it was cold a good sized crowd was waiting
at the graveside. We put our precious Hale away
beside our dear mother in a wilderness of flowers.
A chorus sang "Sometime We'll Understand." Our
old neighbor, Brother Carpenter, made a few
remarks. Mr. & Mrs. Ellis Johnson sang
<span id="page-815"></span>
"Beautiful Home" and a former close neighbor,
Edgar T. Reid, dedicated the grave. What a host
of friends Hale had. This was evident not only
during his illness but at his funeral and burial as
well. So many young people were in attendance.

None of Father's brothers and sisters were
present at the funeral or burial. Neither Aunt
Vena or Aunt Elsie could be there. Uncle Andrew
was in California and Aunt Sarah couldn't come.
Aunt Florence had been taken to the hospital again
so Uncle Louis wasn't there, and Uncle Arthur was
working on a ranch somewhere and couldn't be
reached. Everyone there at the burial however
was so wonderful to us. We stayed all night at
Manti. Phil, Cullen and Mable slept at Reids.
Father and Aunt Myrtle stayed with Aunt Millie
at the Eagle House, while I stayed with 
step-grandmother, Sorena, in the old home where both
Grandmother and Grandfather Christensen had
passed away. I seemed to feel their spirits there.
I'm sure they were among those to welcome Hale
on the other side.

My conversation with Sorena was mostly
about Grandfather's last illness and suffering, for
he had been gone but a few months. Then we talked
of the life hereafter - and somehow we hit upon the
subject of genealogy. I had never thought of this
seriously before but that night I was struck with
my responsibility in this matter' I came away
from Manti bearing Grandmother's and Grandfather's 
Temple Record Book, together with a
firm determination to seek out my dead progenitors
and do something about them. And thus, with Hale's
death, there was born in me the spirit of Elijah. I
did not know then that some thirty-two years hence
I should be spared from a fate similar to this precious
brother's only by the miracle of modern
medicine and a Divine Providence - spared as it
were, or so it seems to me now, to work on our
genealogy. Truly, "God moves in a mysterious
way. . ."

Father, torn for a year after our beloved
Hale's death with nights of sleeplessness and days
of remembering his suffering, went to the Salt
Lake Temple the evening of Hale's twenty-third
<span id="page-816"></span>
birthday, 12 Mar. 1930, together with Elaine and
her husband Ted, and performed the holy endowment 
ordinance for him. A serene peace came to
Father after that, as far as the memory of Hale
was concerned, knowing that he had done the last
great earthly service for this dear, departed son.

## Nephi Wesley Christensen 

(31) Nephi Wesley Christensen (8) We copy
from the Salt Lake Tribune writeup at the time of
Wesley's death, under the headlines "Prominent
Dividend Mining Man Dies in S. L. C. Hospital",
as follows:-- "Nephi Wesley Christensen, 48,
prominent resident of Dividend and well known
mining man, died Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. (10
Aug. 1955) in a Salt Lake City hospital following
a short illness (Holy Cross Hospital).

"He was born 16 May 1907 at Gunnison
(Sanpete Co., Utah) son of Arthur and Millie
Gledhill Christensen. He attended Manti High
School and served several years in the Navy.
(There is an error here - he attended Gunnison
High School, not Manti).

"He married Leola Burraston Aug. 28. 1929
in Nephi. They have made their home in Dividend
for the last twenty-eight years. During that time
he had held many positions with Tintic Standard
Mining Co. and at the time of his death was General 
Superintendent of the mine.

"Christensen was very active in civic affairs
and was a Past Master of Tintic Lodge No. 9 F &
A. M., and was Exalted Ruler of the Benevolent
and Protective Order of Elks Lodge of Eureka,
Utah, the year before his death, holding offices
in each at the time of his death. He had acted for
a number of years as Democratic Chairman for the
Tintic District.

"Funeral services will be held Saturday in
the Quist-Fairbanks Funeral Home in Orem. Rev.
George Webber will officiate in conjunction with
Tintic Mason and Elk lodges. Friends may call
at the funeral home from 7 to 9 p.m. Friday and
Saturday before the services to view the body.
Burial will be in the Provo City Cemetery.
<span id="page-817"></span>

"Survivors include his widow and one son,
Dennis Wesley Christensen, Dividend; and one
daughter, Mrs. Eugene (Colleen) McGee and one
grandson of Boulder, Colorado; his mother, Mrs.
Millie Gudmundson, Salt Lake City; three brothers,
A. Melrose, Max and David, all of Salt Lake City;
two sisters, Mrs. Douglas (Grace) Larsen, Salt
Lake, and Miss Gladys Christensen, San Francisco,
California." 

Wesley's wife, Rosaleola, or Leola, Burraston
Christensen (b. 2 Nov. 1912 in Goshen, Utah to
James and Ruth Esther Ercanbrack), now Mrs.
Curtis O. Montgomery of Sterling, Colorado, writes
of him:- "Wesley joined the service a year or two
after his graduation from high school. He spent
several years in the Navy band. I don't remember
his rating.

"Wes was known to be one of the best
swimmers around, in fact a beautiful swimmer.
There were so many things that were hobbies of
his and he was a master at all of them. Because
of his wonderful memory he was asked to participate
in various offices even after he became ill.

"He was very much like his father in many,
many ways; being very quiet and so thoughtful and
kind, but in looks he favored his mother's side of
the family although many people mistook him for
his cousin Sherman Christensen in his last few
years. (They did look alike then). Wes was about
5'11" tall, with curly auburn hair, brown eyes and
a handsome straight stature (well disciplined). To
me he was almost perfect.

"He died of kidney infection (nephritis) and
finally heart failure. I sensed something beautiful
about his death. He didn't attend church a great
deal except with me and when the children were
small, but he was a deeply religious man at heart.

"I met Wesley in Dividend. I was assistant
postmistress at the Tintic Standard Mining Co.
there for many years. I acted as such again for
a few months when he became ill and just before
he passed away. With the exception of some few
months in about 1928 when he left the mine to
help his father on a ranch, Wes was in the mining
<span id="page-818"></span>
business all of his adult life."

Echos of the past are heard in the words of a
letter written by Wesley's sister Grace to his sister
Gladys in California, Wed. 11 Nov. 1942:- "Dear
Gladys. Doug and I spent last weekend with Wes
and Leola. Mostly we visited, talked about you,
the war - how it could be won, etc., and hunted
pheasants. We did a lot of hiking, falling over
fences and ditches, but we did get our limit.
Surely had a good time. Wes is one grand 
fellow - heart as big as a house! Leola has developed a
fast heart - really quite worried about her.

"The biggest thrill was the deer we shot. We
brought home five birds, Wes, the cutie, put three
extra birds in our car for mother. The older I get
the more I appreciate our wonderful brothers. They
are all so different and so lovable. Couldn't help
but think how you would have enjoyed the trip with
us. - Love, Grace."

## Spencer Christensen 

(32) Spencer Christensen (7). was born in
Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 31 Mar. 1908. His sister
LaFaun writes: "Spencer died 6 May 1908 in
Gunnison. I remember being with him at the time.
He took convulsions. He was buried in the Gunnison
Cemetery. I used to ride my horse to the
cemetery nearly every day during nice weather to
put flowers on his little grave. I remember his
funeral, which was held in our Christensen grandparents'
big rock house which later became our
home."

## Elsie Eliza Christensen

(33) Elsie Eliza Christensen (2) was born
30 Oct. 1908 in Salt Lake City, Utah. She died at
seventeen months, 8 Apr. 1910, having been
drowned in the fish pond at the family home in Salt
Lake City. She was buried in Provo, Utah.
Details of her death can be found in earlier pages
of this book.

## Grace Christensen

(34) Grace Christensen, twin (8) calls her
history "My Memories." Although many of her
memories have been quoted in earlier pages of
this book, some have been repeated here:- "Three
of the six children of Millie and Arthur Christensen
were born in the 'rock house' in West Gunnison.
This house, as I remember, was a square structure
with an upstairs and balcony. The water we
used was taken from a well at the back door. For
light we used kerosine lamps. In fact, Dr. Hagan
bumped his head on the hanging lamp when he
delivered us twins, Gladys and me. I heard the
grown-ups talk and joke so much about this that I
actually thought I had seen it and heard the bang.

"My parents were proud and happy with their
<span id="page-820"></span>
enlarged family - four children under the age of
four. Then too, the way things happened was quite
the talk around town. I was born about twenty
minutes before midnight on Feb. 16, 1909 and
Gladys was born about twenty minutes after midnight
on Feb. 17, 1909. Twins born on different
days. Our family moved to a ranch at Upton, Utah,
when the two of us were going on three (1911).
Gladys seemed to be the constant concern of everyone
there. She got into so much trouble. I was in
on some of it too.

"Both Melrose and Wesley started school at
Upton. They rode horses; we all did - the four kids
on one horse at times. Melrose was reliable and
was the 'boss' when Mother and Dad were away. I
remember the wonderful music of my Mother and
Father. Their voices blended so beautifully.
Mother played the guitar and Dad the mandolin.
At this time I thought there was nothing so heavenly.
Many times we were lulled to sleep by their songs.

"We moved back to Gunnison into the house
Father had bought from our Uncle Chris. Mother
really had her hands full trying to get Gladys and
me ready for our first day at school. Everything
was home-made - even our bloomers and our hand
knit stockings. I recall so well the old rain barrel
just outside the door. This soft rainwater was used
for washing our long hair.

"That late fall we moved into the handsome
red-brick house Father bought from Aunt Elsie.
This was wonderful - pavement all over, up to the
barn, around the house - everywhere. We raced
around in our little wagons. It was shortly after
this that Father and Mother decided to go into the
grocery business and politics. Dad was persuaded
by friends to run for Mayor of Gunnison. He lost
the race by two votes. Actually, he was relieved
to have lost; his heart wasn't in it - nor the grocery
store either. He longed to be outside with the
animals and soil. So he rented a farm west of
Gunnison and we moved there. Melrose, Wesley,
Gladys and I were old enough to help on the farm.
We worked hard with the sugar beets, hay, grain,
etc., for a year or two. Then we moved back to
the red-brick home.
<span id="page-821"></span>

"At Christmas time, when Gladys and I were
sophomores in Gunnison High School, we moved to
Manti to run and operate the Eagle House Hotel.
Gladys and I graduated from Manti High School
and then rode the bus one year to attend Snow
College in Ephraim, some miles to the north.
Gladys was offered a job, and accepted, to teach
group piano to school children in South Sanpete
School District. I finished my second year at
Snow and received a teacher's certificate.

"I taught two years at Mt. Emmons in
Duchesne Co., Utah. The following summer I met
Douglas Larsen, a registered professional
engineer and surveyor. From then on I decided
to work nearby, so taught fifth grade at Gunnison
for one-and-a-half years. Father was then ranching
at Trout Creek and it was here his health
began to fail. He died in the LDS Hospital in Salt
Lake City 2 Dec. 1932 at age fifty, of a ruptured
gall bladder.

"Douglas and I were married a month later,
3 Jan. 1933, at Richfield, Utah. (Douglas Forrester
Larsen b. 6 Aug. 1899, Salt Lake City, Utah to
John and Louise Larsen Larsen). Doug's work as
an engineer took us to several places in our early
married years - Parowan, Beaver, Vernal, Price,
three years in Richfield, etc. In 1941 we moved
to Salt Lake City where Doug was District Engineer
for the State Highway Dept. and later Chief 
Construction and Materials engineer.

"By this time Mother had moved to a big
house in Salt Lake City and we moved in with her.
David and Max were still at home and Gladys also
lived with Mother until 1942 when she moved to
California. Our daughter, Sydney, was born while
we were living here, in 1943. When she was six
months old we bought a home on Hollywood Ave.
and lived there about two years.

"In the meantime Mother married Octav
Gudmundson and was working at Auerbach's. We
moved back with her and 'Goodie'. In those days
the children were coming and going; it wasn't
unusual to cook and do for fifteen people at once.
Then in Aug. 1950 Doug and I bought our present
<span id="page-822"></span>
home on Emerson Ave, and moved into that.

"Sydney was then in school, so I decided to
go back to my profession of teaching. I have been
at Highland Park Elementary School for nearly
sixteen years. I graduated from the University of
Utah cum laude in 1965. A year later Sydney
received her BS degree from the U of U in recreational 
therapy. She has been working as a therapist
with special children at the Primary Children's
Hospital in Salt Lake City since then and is working
on her Masters degree."

Daughter of Grace Christensen and Douglas
Forrester Larsen:

Salt Lake City, Utah; md. 23 May 1969 in Salt
Lake City, Harry Lewis Post (b. 11 July 1945
in Salt Lake City to William Allsworth and Sara
LeLisle Cram Post).

## Gladys Christensen

(35) Gladys Christensen, twin (8) was born
17 Feb. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. She
gives glimpses into various periods of her life as
she writes her "Recollections":-- "Upton - age
about four or five. Grace and I used to play in
the storehouse which was sometimes used for the
storage of dynamite. One of our favorite games
was playing 'Papa and Mama'. One day Grace was
the papa, whose job was to get up in the morning
to make the fire. She set fire to a rope which was
hanging from the ceiling. About that time mother
called and we scampered out, not realizing that in
a matter of minutes the whole place would be
ablaze. Our Uncle Albert Gledhill spotted the
smoke and got everyone out of our adjoining house
in a hurry, as they thought there was dynamite
there, though it turned out there wasn't at that
time. Grace and I didn't tell anyone till years
later that we started that fire.

"Uncle Bert saved me again! He was coming
home from the fields and spotted a gingham dress
floating in the ditch of water not far from our house.
He thought that a piece of mother's washing had
blown into the ditch. He pulled it out and lo and
behold it was I! Apparently I had been watching
<span id="page-823"></span>
the water running under the bridge and fallen in.
He carried me by the heels to the house and the
doctor said this probably saved my life by allowing
all the water to drain out of me.

"Gunnison - age six. I remember how anxious
I was to go to school. The day finally arrived and
I was so afraid I was going to be late. In desperation
Mother finally put me in a closet until it was
time to go. It was fun being 'twins' in school. I
don't recall any others in our grade. My name was
always 'Grace and Gladys' and Grace's was 'Gladys
and Grace'. Soon we moved to live in a beautiful
red-brick house in the east part of town. I guess
we didn't have much money because mother took
in boarders.

"Then one summer we almost cried when we
found out that Dad and Mother had rented our
beautiful house to some 'foreigners' and we were
going to move to a farm northwest of Gunnison.
There was a two roomed house on the farm and it
was really surprising how warm and comfortable
Mother made it look, although it was rather
crowded for our family of seven. Mother wanted
to be sure that our musical education was not
neglected, so down to the farm went our piano and
every week there were music lessons in town, with
plenty of practicing in between. In winter we went
to school by buggy and 'Old Grady', our dear old
horse. Rain, snow or shine we went to school!
Also in winter Mother insisted that Grace and I
wear those awful hand knitted black stockings.
We were so embarrassed with them that they came
off as soon as we hit the school grounds. Then 
there were those 'black sateen bloomers and the
scuffers' which never seemed to wear out.

"Salt Lake City - age twelve. I went to live
with my Aunt Mary and Uncle Glen Dowdle in Sait
Lake City. Mother thought that I should further 
my musical education at the McCune School of 
Music. I went to summer school there on Sixth 
South. I had a great time and loved living with
Aunt Mary. I don't know what arrangements were
made for my keep, but every week here would 
come two lbs. of home-made butter and printed
on the wrapping 'Made by Mrs. A. M. Christensen.'
<span id="page-824"></span>
Mother used to sell her home-made butter to
stores in Gunnison. One morning Aunt Mary
found me asleep in bed with a picture of Melrose
in my arms and tear stains on my face, so that
was the end of my city life for awhile.

"Manti - age fifteen. In the middle of my
second year in High School we moved to Manti and
started a new life in the 'Eagle House Hotel'. Dad
left the hotel business to us women and went to
work elsewhere. Mother too worked very hard
(with our help) and it was not an easy life, but it
was not without its compensations. We did meet
many new friends. Doug Larsen was one of
Mother's star boarders at the hotel. He worked
for the Utah State Road Commission and spent
quite a lot of time in Manti. At one time there
was some competition between Grace and me
about who would get a date with Mr. Larsen.
Grace finally won out and she and Douglas have
been happily married for thirty-six years.

"Miss Farnsworth (later Aunt Myrtle) taught
me English composition at Manti High. She was
an excellent teacher. After graduation from there
Grace and I attended Snow College. After a year
there Mr. E. T. Reid, Superintendent of the South
Sanpete School District, asked me to consider
teaching group piano in the district. It was done
with cardboard keyboards. I agreed and spent the
summer studying in Salt Lake City, again at the
McCune School of Music. I lived with Aunt Sarah
Christensen and just loved her I spent many
happy times that summer with cousins Margaret
and Lucile.

"I taught that winter and spent my time in
schools of nine different towns. One of these
towns was Clarion where most of my students
were Japanese - but they were excellent students.
I would ride with Mr. Reid when he was going my
way. Other times it was agreed that I could get
a car at the Gently Garage in Manti. They charged
the school district eight cents per mile which
included gas, oil and the works. I really had a
good time on those days.

"Grace went on the college and started a
<span id="page-825"></span>
teaching career until she married at the age of
twenty-three. I went on to business college - teaching 
was not for me! After graduation I got
a job with the Fleishman Yeast Company, first
in Salt Lake City and then in San Francisco, Calif.
and am still with the same firm." Gladys has
never married and when I saw her last I wondered
how she ever managed it. She is a charming,
lovely person.

## Virgil Bartholomew Christensen 

(36) Virgil Bartholomew Christensen (3)
was born 26 Feb. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete,
Utah, in the home in west Gunnison which is still 
standing (1969). His wife Elda writes of 
him:- "Virgil attended grade school and high school
(up to a Junior) in Gunnison. When he was about
twelve they moved from the big home of his birth
to a farm west of Gunnison known as Rocky Point.
From here they walked to school, good weather
or bad.

"Virgil's mother told of him having a bad
sick spell when he was very young. It started
with 'summer complaint' which ran on until they
were afraid they would lose him. The doctor said
if he did live his mind might be affected. But
through prayer and the power of the priesthood he
was cured and became a well, healthy child,
growing to be the largest of Joseph and Roxie's
family of big sons.

"Virgil and his brothers had lots of good
times along with the hard times. One fall, at
duck season, Marvin and he decided to go hunting
early so that they would be out and ready to hunt
at daybreak. They set the clock and went to bed.
When the alarm went off they were up and away.
It was cold. They waited and waited for daylight
to come but it seemed it never would get light.
Virgil said he just couldn't figure out why it took
so long to get light. Finally Marvin admitted that
he had set the clock ahead so they'd be sure to be
on time. They had been sitting there half the night."

Virgil was past seventeen when his father
died in the farm house near Rocky Point, leaving
the family in very modest circumstances. Harold
<span id="page-826"></span>
and Ruth Ellen had long since left the home and
Myron married within the year, leaving him as
"man of the house". He and his mother and two
younger brothers, Marvin and Don, tried to make
out on Rocky Point for awhile after that, but the
fall of 1928 they left and moved to Fayette, some
six miles north, to live with his mother's brother,
Uncle Henry Bartholomew, whose wife had recently
passed away leaving him with some young children.
The arrangement turned out fine for both families.
Virgil enjoyed living in Fayette, going with the
young folks, attending church, parties and dances.

On 12 Nov. 1930 in the county seat at Manti,
Sanpete, Utah, he married Elda Jane Hill (b. 27
Aug. 1907 in Fayette to Richard Return and Sarah
Jane Bown Hill). They made Fayette their home
and here they still reside. Elda takes up the
story again:- "Virgil is truck driver by trade - he
has been buying trucks all his married life. He
has hauled cattle, coal, furniture, taken Boy
Scouts and other groups on trips, anything to
make ends meet. He has also done road construction 
work in various places. More recently he has
been working for W. W. Gardener in Salt Lake,
hauling black top and gravel in the summer and
sand and rock in winter. This will be his twelfth
year with Gardener.

"Virgil is 6 ft. 2 inches tall and weighs 260
lbs. He has blue eyes, not very dark hair - now
showing grey - and usually a good natured disposition.
He has been and is a fine father and provider.
Being very fussy and particular when he does a job,
you will know if he builds something it will be
straight. He built most of the home we live in and
the racks and beds for his trucks, though his
present truck has a steel bed.

"He is honest, and willing to help people out
whenever he can; for example, a couple came to
our door late one night who were having car trouble.
They were from Salt Lake and headed for Phoenix,
Arizona. Virgil phoned around to try and find
someone to come and fix their car but the garages
were all closed and he could find no help. So he
told the strangers that they could take his car to
Gunnison and get a motel, there being no such 
<span id="page-827"></span>
accommodations in Fayette, and then come back
and get their car fixed in the morning. The man
turned to him and said 'Are you a Bishop?'
Virgil laughed and said, 'Well, I might look the
part but I'm not.'

"He has been a Ward Teacher, Second Counselor 
in the MIA, and on 3 Dec. 1950 was put in
as Second Counselor in the Sunday School 
Superintendency. On 23 Nov. 1952 he was made First
Counselor and held the office for several years,
He was also secretary of the Melchizedek priesthood 
but was released from these duties when he
became employed in Salt Lake.

"Virgil loves to hunt. He likes to tell about
the time, over west of Fayette, when he got into a
flock of geese, killing eight - he was so excited
about that. He likes to fish, always trying to outdo
his boys, which isn't easy. I don't believe he has
ever missed a deer hunt since he became old
enough to go. He always goes up Twelve Mile and
all through the years has always gotten his deer.
Our youngest son said, 'I wouldn't miss that first
night of the deer hunt for anything - sitting around
the campfire listening to all the deer stories they
tell.' The fall of 1966 there were thirteen men in
Virgil's hunting party and they killed twelve 
deer - it was most exciting! They put all the deer in one
pickup truck and came down the canyon singing and
tooting the horns of their cars for all the other
hunters to see and hear. They telephoned ahead
from Mayfield for their wives to meet them in
Gunnison and take pictures of the haul.

"We have traveled quite a bit. Virgil went 
back to Detroit after one of his trucks. He drove
to Los Angeles to pick up a load of furniture for a
lady and said he liked to never have gotten out of
that city. In 1964 we drove to Moab and watched
some of the filming of 'The Greatest Story Ever
Told', currently being shown in local theaters.
Then we drove on to see the Arizona Temple at
Mesa and the Wax Museum in Scottsdale and other
points of interest in Phoenix, etc. In 1965 we
traveled to San Diego, Tijuana, Mexico, and
visited a daughter in Los Angeles. In 1966 we
went to San Francisco and drove over to see the
<span id="page-828"></span>
Oakland Temple, etc. The spring of 1967 we
visited in Oregon and the Northwest. This
current spring, 1969, we again took a trip to
Oregon to visit our daughter Jean."

## Farrald DeLong Christensen 

(37) Farrald DeLong Christensen (1) was
born 3 Sep. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah.
Farrald, always modest, writes a little of himself 
and family:- "I was the last of the family born
in Gunnison, I am told; the folks moved to Salt
Lake City when I was about nine months oid."

He was but a month past his eighth birthday
when his father met with his death. Again he
writes, "Because mother was alone to raise the
family for many years, we had something of a
struggle to get along. Roy was working in McGill,
Nevada, and for a long time we had no support
except what he sent to Mother each month. I
managed to get through school, working as I could
during the summers. I graduated from the old
LDS College (High School) in 1928, then had a
couple of sessions at the LDS Business College
after that.

"After jobbing around for several years I
went to work for my present employer, the Utah
Dept. of Employment Security. I was also busy
as a young man in priesthood activities and was
in the YMMIA presidency of the Ward for a couple
of years. We kept the old family home in Salt
Lake until after Mother died.

"On 17 Oct. 1943 I married Beulah Eliza
Nielsen (b. 4 June 1914 in Axtell, Utah to Carl
Erastus and Jane Ann Metcalf Nielsen) and we
moved into the Stratford Ward in Salt Lake City.
Here we lived for twelve years before moving to
our present home in Bountiful, Utah. During
those twelve years Beulah was active in the Primary 
Association and I again worked in the YMMIA
as one of the presidency, Scout Master and the
like. Our church service continued after we moved
to Bountiful and again I had various jobs with the
Scouts, Explorers, etc., while Beulah, after the
children got a little older, worked in the MIA Beehive 
program for several years. She then went
<span id="page-830"></span>
into the Stake as YWMIA secretary, which position
she still holds."

Farrald served in World War II in the Navy.
He was on a destroyer escort in the Pacific much
of the time. He left his wife and children in Salt
Lake City, going in Mar. 1944 and returning twenty
months later, in November 1946. He was with the
U. S. Naval forces which were poised for a gigantic
invasion of Japan, when the war ended. This was
entirely voluntary service as far as Farrald was
concerned, since he was not required to go except
by the dictates of his own conscience and his deep
sense of patriotism.

He continues his report: "We have four children, 
all boys: Carl, Beulah's son by a previous
marriage whom I adopted, Leon, Lavon and Gerald
Ray. When we finally went to the temple (29 Jan.
1964) all four of the boys went along and were sealed
to us.

"Carl was called on a mission for the church
shortly after graduating from Davis High School.
He was called to serve in Argentina but was sent
at once to Chile where he served in what became
the Chilean and then the Andes Mission. Leon
graduated from Bountiful High School and attended
the University of Utah for two years before accepting 
a mission call to Denmark. After returning
home he went back to the University and graduated.
Lavon also graduated from Bountiful High School
and attended the University of Utah for two years.
He then entered military service and served in
Viet Nam with the 4th Infantry. He is now safely
home and back at the University. Gerald also
finished High School at Bountiful and started
college at the U of U. After the first quarter he
received a call to the Northern Mexican Mission.
He too is home again and back in school at the
University.

"I myself am now secretary for the High
Priests group in our Ward in Bountiful so am not
entirely at my ease." Farrald, upon questioning,
admitted he had other hobbies besides his family
and the church, mostly "do-it-yourself" projects.
We would like to add that he has a great spirit of
<span id="page-831"></span>
family loyalty which extends far beyond his own
immediate family. His two sisters, Pearl and
Ivy, live in Salt Lake and he visits them often.

He also visits his brothers, Elmer and Roy, who
are out of State on occasions and keeps in touch
by phoning them once a month, failing to have success 
with answers to his letters. Farrald is perhaps 
the most regular attender of all the members
of the Christensen family at funerals of aunts,
uncles, cousins and other relatives on all sides.
He and Beulah can almost always be found among
the mourners in attendance. Though Cousin Byron
may run him a close second in this, Farrald is
most faithful in paying his respects to our dead
and their bereaved families.

Farrald is a tall man and resembles his
father more and more to an almost startling degree
as the years go by. Though he knew his father for
so short a time yet many of his mannerisms are
like his, although he is much more quiet in nature.
Beulah makes him a fine companion and together
they are forging ahead towards the goals they have
so wisely set for themselves.

## Dale Carmen Christensen 
<span id="page-832"></span>

(38) Dale Carmen Christensen (7) was born
7 Oct. 1909 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, in the
rock house that once belonged to his Christensen
grandparents and which still stands today (1969).

Dale left Gunnison with his family when he
was five months past six years old, having attended
school one winter there.

He was married 16 Oct. 1929 in the Salt Lake
Temple to Ruby De St Jeor (b. 4 Oct. 1908 in Lyman, 
yoming to William and Elizabeth Burnett
De St Jeor). At present she is living in Nampa,
Idaho and writes of him:-- "Dale came to Wyoming
as a child. He attended schools at Lyman, Evanston 
and Cheyenne. We met at a high school dance
at Lyman. After our marriage we lived at Lyman
for several years.

"Though his main hobby seemed to be reading,
Dale always loved to work around machinery,
trucks and heavy equipment. He started following
construction work which took us to Oregon, Nevada
and Idaho. (Dale, assisted by Ruby, owned and
managed a large trucking concern in what was
known as "The Dalles" Oregon for some time; also
a service station). His last year was spent at
Nampa, Idaho. He became an invalid here after
suffering a heart attack and stroke. Dale had
always had such perfect health prior to this."

On 22 Sep. 1947 Dale and Ruby adopted a
nine-year-old girl, Rosealyce (b. 3 May 1938 at
Green River, Wyoming) but the experiment turned
out to be a failure. Dale was a big, good looking
man with beautiful brown eyes, inherited from his
mother. He passed away in Nampa, Idaho, 10
Oct. 1958, three days after his fifty-first birthday.
He was buried 14 Oct, 1958 in Lyman, Wyoming.
He and Ruby have no descendants.

## Imelda Peterson

(39) Imelda Peterson (6) was born 13 Jan,
1910 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah in the house on
the ranch a mile east of town. She grew up in
Gunnison, attending school there and graduating
from High School. Her brother Byron says she
was the scholar of the family and was a fine speller,
<span id="page-833"></span>
being able to "spell down" anyone in her class
when spelling matches were held.

Imelda was going on eighteen when her
mother died. Her sister Ada soon married and
in early 1930 Byron left for his mission. She was
left to care for things at the home. She was always
active in the organizations of the church. Cousin
Vera Clark lived with her the winter of 1930/31
and went to school in Gunnison. She remembers
how good Imelda and Uncle Charles were to her.
They took her along to Delta on occasions to visit
Ada, and Imelda took her to MIA with her to visit
her class, for she taught the Beehive girls at that
time.

Imelda attended Snow College at Ephraim
and also BYU at Provo for one quarter. Then she
went with Cousin Gladys to Salt Lake to attend
Henager Business College for a short while. In
early spring of 1934 she was called to serve in the
Canadian Mission. She writes of this:- "I was out
for twenty months. I left the Mission Home 21 Mar.
1934. The cities of Hamilton, St. Catherines and
Montreal were my assignments. Toronto was our
Mission Home in Canada and we traveled both by
land and by water to our missionary conventions
that were held there. We joined with many missionaries 
at the Prophet Joseph Smith's birthplace
in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, in an outstanding
missionary reunion. We were about fifty
in number and were there for five wonderful days.
We traveled by bus from Montreal and ferried
across Lake Champlain. The beauty of the country
still lingers in my memory. Another inspiring
missionary conference was held on Mt, Patriarch.
It was called the South Royalton reunion. John
Bluth was our mission president at that time and
Elder Wallis, traveling Patriarch at the time,
officiated."

Imelda's sister Ada writes: "At one time
Imelda's mission president was Woodrow Miller
of the Miller Honey Company. One of her companions 
in the mission field was Chyio Thomas,
daughter of U. S. Senator Thomas from Utah. In
Dec. 1936 she was released from her mission and
she and Chyio were invited to the White House as
<span id="page-834"></span>
guests of Senator Thomas. This was another highlight
in her life."

Sometime after returning from her mission
Imelda went to California with a girl friend to find
employment. She also took some nurses training
while there. It was in California that she met her
future husband at a "jitney dance" in Los Angeles.
She was married 11 Jan. 1941 in Las Vegas, Nevada,
to Albert Elvin Kissinger (b. 7 May 1887 in Castleton, 
Illinois to Frank and Katherine Bali Kissinger).
He, however, often went by the name of Robert. He
was tall and handsome and a photographer by trade.
He was nearly thirteen years Imelda's senior and
she was his fourth wife. They made their home in
Los Angeles. They had two children, a daughter
Karma and a son Chad.

On Oct. 31, 1958 Imelda wrote of her 
family:- "Our daughter Karma is going on seventeen, a
senior in high school. She is interested in many
different lines of endeavor - art, music, hair
styling, fashions. She seems to think she would
like to be in the fashion field. She will have more
time after school is out this summer to follow
along this line.

"Our son Chad is nine and has been a Cub
Scout for a year now. He is having a good active
time. It has given his mother a full schedule too,
for I am now a 'Den Mother' on top of all my other
responsibilities. Chad enjoys school very much,
is a great reader, has a good thinking head and
uses it and is advanced for his years. He is
always looking for something more active in school
and has been given special assignments by his
teachers, as he gets things done. At present he is
a 'safety' for playground activities. He is observant
and in love with life. I'm very grateful for these
two children and hope to do a good job by them.

"Their father is not a member of the church
and though born a Methodist, with religious ministers
in his father's family, is not seeking any religion
nor at all interested in it. His own father was one
of thirteen children who mostly had large families,
so there are many by the name of Kissinger in the
country. My husband himself has had nine children,
three by his first marriage, two by the second, two
<span id="page-835"></span>
by the third and now our two children. What do I
do about our genealogy?"

Though not too strong or not always in good
health, Imelda has worked a lot outside the home
from time to time. She sold Child Craft and World
Book for awhile and was also a saleslady for other
things. She has worked in hospitals and at private
nursing. Her husband passed away in December
1963 in Los Angeles after a long and painful illness.
He was nearing his seventy-sixth birthday. Since
then Imelda has done the best she could in providing
for her family.

Ada brings her sister's story up to date in
these words:- "Imelda dear is busy in her way too.
Much sickness has been her unhappiness. Her
husband died of cancer and her daughter Karma
developed brittle diabetes at the age of twenty and
has been in and out of the hospital. She is so
gifted in art, music and creative ability - it seems
a shame to have her thus handicapped. Her son
Chad is a fine chap and now works for Standard
Oil. Today Imelda is a registered practical
nurse and employed by Eddie Albert, the TV and
motion picture star, to care for his aged father.
She is active in Relief Society and Sunday School."

Children of Imelda Peterson and Albert
Elvin Kissinger:

1. Karma Kissinger born 15 Feb. 1942 in
Delta, Utah.

1. Chadwell Elvin Kissinger born 11 Oct. 1949
in Los Angeles, Calif.

## Edith Bartholomew

(40) Edith Bartholomew (5), according to the
record of her found in her mother's Book of
Remembrance, was born 10 Feb. 1910 in the red
brick home in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, the first
of her children to be born there. From this record
we also learn that she was named and blessed by
her uncle, Bishop Joseph Christensen, in Gunnison;
baptized 2 Feb. 1919 in the Ogden Fourth Ward by
Bishop L. Willard Gardner and confirmed the same
day and place by Elder E. A. Olsen.

We follow her as she moved with her family
<span id="page-836"></span>
from Gunnison to Wyoming to Ogden and finally to
Goshen, Utah. Here she was set apart at age
twelve and a half, 6 Sep. 1922, as Sunday School
organist, by Robert Finch, also set apart 1 Jan.
1923 as Primary organist, as well as serving as
a teacher in the same organization. She finished
tenth grade while living in Goshen, having previously
attended school at Lyman, Wyoming, and Ogden,
Utah.

Edith then attended Payson High School from
which she graduated 18 May 1927. In the spring of
1931 her family moved into a new home in Payson
and here she continued her church service, becoming 
organist of Payson Fourth Ward Sunday School
as well as Ward organist. Later she became
chorister of Nebo Stake Primary.

Edith attended Brigham Young University
and graduated there with a Bachelor of Arts degree,
4 June 1930. That fall she began teaching at Payson
Junior High School and taught there four consecutive
winters. In the meantime she started keeping company
with a young man named Heber C. Bauer. The
summer of 1933 she went with him and Dr. & Mrs.
Norman Osborn to attend the Century of Progress
Exposition in Chicago,Illinois.

She was married 22 June 1934 in the Salt Lake
Temple to this same Heber Carl Bauer (b. 9 Aug.
1901 in Idaho Falls (Coltman) Idaho to Eberhardt
George and Katherine Christina Hauber Bauer). A
reception was held in their honor that same evening
in her parents' home in Payson. After a honeymoon
in Yellowstone National Park they made their first
home at 544 East 1st North in Payson. It was in
Payson also that their two children, Helen and
Boyd, were born, Dr. Merrill L. Oldroyd being
in attendance at both births.

In May of 1940 the Bauer family moved to
Glendale, Calif. and in October 1941 they moved
to North Hollywood. They returned to Utah on a
visit the early fall of 1943. Heber returned soon
to California to look over a new employment opportunity 
but was stricken with polio and was rushed
to a Los Angeles hospital. Edith was summoned
and left the children with her parents in Payson,
<span id="page-837"></span>
to be at his bedside. But Heber passed away
shortly afterwards, 26 Sep. 1943 and his body was
returned to Payson for burial, 1 Oct. 1943.

Following this sad experience Edith returned
to their home in California where her brother
Clifton's wife, Rhea, stayed with her until she
sold the home. She and the two children moved
back to her parents' home in Payson in Feb. 1944.
She entered BYU again the spring quarter of that
year, expecting to renew her teaching certificate
but was encouraged to remain and work towards
obtaining a Master's Degree. She was employed
there as an instructor the winter of 1945/46 and in
June 1946 received her Master's Degree. In Sep.
1947 she went to Berkeley, California, for graduate
study towards her Doctor's Degree which she
finally obtained in 1956. Her professional work in
education has continued at BYU to the present and
she is considered "tops" in her field.

At present Edith is also a member of the
National Education Foundation of the American
Association of University Women (A.A.U.W.).
She was nominated by the Utah Division of that
board for this honored position, at which time
they presented her extensive Vita, along with the
following recommendation: "We feel that Dr.
Edith B. Bauer's experience as Professor of
Educational Psychology at Brigham Young University, 
her excellent professional training, her
administrative experience at BYU and in Tehran
under USOM, contract #115 and her service on
the Association's International Fellowship Award
committee 1962-68, eminently qualify her for the
position.

"Dr. Bauer has held many offices in the
Provo branch and was president 1961-62. She
has served on the Utah Division Board as Implementation 
chairman in Revolution in Modern China.
She understands the needs and goals of A.A.U.W.
and is proud of the Education Foundation. She
would like to see it expand its research facilities.

"We are recommending her not only because
of her professional qualifications but also because
of her gracious personality, her devoted service
<span id="page-838"></span>
to educational projects in her community and her
long years of administrative service and teaching
in religious education in the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints. We solicit your interest and
support of her, and commend to you her comprehensive 
Vita. Utah members of the A.A.U.W. think Dr. Edith B. 
Bauer would be an asset to the Educational Foundation."

Jackson and entitled "Meet Your New Board Members" (abt. 
Nov. 1960). Edith was among those
written up in this article, parts of which we quote
here:- "Chatting with Dr. Edith B. Bauer is a real
treat. One is immediately aware of her enthusiasm
for living. She readily admits she is an optimist,
but not the overactive bubbling kind who thrive on
froth and the pleasure of the moment. In fact she
says, 'Life has many discouraging moments, but
it would be meaningless if there weren't some prob-
lems to face and solve'.

"For those who may not have enough problems
to solve - who yearn for a life of excitement and
adventure - Dr. Bauer recommends a foreign
mission. She returned only a short while ago from
Tehran, Iran where she served two years as an
advisor to the education program at the University
of Tehran. 'When I made my final decision to go
to Iran and began packing', she recalls, 'I became
very apprehensive. This feeling grew worse as
we stopped for an emergency fueling at Gander,
Newfoundland - there was a heavy storm over the
Atlantic. And by the time I got to Istanbul (Con-
stantinople) this feeling reached a new high.
Imagine, late in the evening, being surrounded by
strange dialects, sights and smells. I felt so
helpless to it all - as though I were at the end of
the earth. Then, to top it all, someone said
Tehran was even more remote.'

"But Sister Bauer found a friendly group of
people at the airport in Tehran to welcome her (a
custom there); there was an LDS branch in the city;
comfortable accomodations were found for herself,
her son and Dr. Reichert, the other woman technician 
from Utah; the climate and mountain terrain
<span id="page-842"></span>
bore close similarity to those in Utah; and the
Persian Gardens were beyond her expectations in
their exotic beauty. Needless to say, Dr. Bauer
also found many problems and challenges during
her eventful stay in Iran. But then, she had
encountered many of these in her earlier life. One
of them was adjusting to new places.

"Her most crushing and challenging problem
was that of adjusting to the sudden death of her
husband, Heber Carl Bauer, in the fall of 1943.
For a time, little other than the need to care for
her two young children seemed important. However, 
from these experiences has developed an
increased appreciation for her parents, her
children and friends, and a greater faith in God,

"Edith has served the church in various capacities 
since her first assignment of being Sunday
School organist at age 12. She has had teaching
experiences in all the auxiliary organizations of
the church. She has been Primary president and
Stake Board member, Ward YWMIA president and
Stake Board member, Ward chorister and organist,
Coordinator for the Junior Sunday School and
teacher-trainer director."

At this present writing Edith is living alone.
Her children, Helen (Kimball) a graduate of BYU
and a registered nurse lives in California, and
her son, Boyd, a specialist in Asian affairs and
a candidate for a PhD at American University,
Washington D. C., lives in Illinois. Another
special honor has just come to Edith, for the Utah
Division of the American Association of University
Women presented its "Distinguished Woman, 1969,"
award to her at a banquet 19 Apr. 1969 in Salt Lake
City.

## Luther Bartholomew Christensen

(41) Luther Bartholomew Christensen (2) His sister Edith writes: "When our youngest brother Luther arrived he was a beauty! But when a few weeks old he contracted pneumonia. Mother doctored him first with what she knew but began to despair of his life. They called the doctor. He reduced the living room heat, opened the windows wide and ordered the infant to be wrapped in cloths wrung from ice water. Mother proceeded with panic in her heart, ice water! But it worked! The fever dropped, the congestion vanished, the baby ate again and it was over - like a miracle!"

Luther writes of his own life: "It was a cold, grey spring morning on 20 May 1911, in the little university town of Leipzig, Germany, when the doctor walked down the two flights of stairs to file my birth certificate. Soon afterwards my father was asked to leave the school, for 'infractions',  a little rule against students preaching religion. They didn't even give him time to organize a protest march or sit down strike. I am told that Father left first and that the family followed shortly, and I was carried, wheeled, shipped, railroaded and autoed from place to place.

"Father was finally sent to Rexburg, Idaho to convert the school there from a high school to college standard. I had then reached the age of five and my first recollection is of lying on my belly on a foot bridge over an irrigation canal, dangling a pinned worm in front of a fat lazy trout that was holding himself motionless in the clear <span id="page-844"></span>cold water flowing past his brilliant sides. I don't remember if he took that worm, but I do remember
hundreds since that did.

"It was here on Jan. 29, 1961 I was given a patriarchal blessing in which I was promised I should never have any broken bones. My family tell the story of my brothers, Wendell and Sheldon, wanting to prove this theory. When Mother had them taking care of me one day, they instigated a game where one of them tossed me from the hayloft in the barn to the other who was standing in a wagon that was half full of hay. Somehow I managed to slip between the hayloft and the wagon and landed on the ground. I was plenty bruised but no bones broken. This should have given both of them a very good testimony.

"From Rexburg we moved to LaVerkin, Utah. Here I made mud pies, got my Sunday shirts covered with black cherry juice, caught ground squirrels, and generally kept my parents busy. I remember the pool being built at the hot sulphur springs that were so prevalent there, the sargum cane which was being made into sargum, the bantum chickens which were fed from seeds of the sargum cane, watercress growing in the cold water spring that flowed into the Virgin River, and the fresh milk being placed in the cooler for the cream to rise and be skimmed off and made into butter. I remember that the older kids trapped possums, coyotes, bob cats, raccoons, etc., and I remember the horse Father bought Mother, which later contracted lockjaw and had to be shot and dragged by a team of horses to the rim of the gorge and pushed over, a procedure used to dispose of dead animals.

"We moved from LaVerkin to Hinckley, Utah, and lived on a farm. I trapped quimps and kept their heads, as a bounty was being paid for these. I pretended these were all sorts of fur-bearing animals - I was a big trapper! It was here I
started first grade. I remember there was a little girl sitting in front of me with long hair. One day I stuck a wad of gum in it. When she fussed, I quickly explained how she could pull out one hair at a time where the gum was and it
wouldn't hurt, by demonstrating on my own hair. <span id="page-845"></span>The result was a round bald spot on my head which was quite difficult to explain to Mother that night when I got home. I remember going with Wendell and Sheldon spearing carp from sloughs and the canal in front of our house. This was the year of the big influenza epidemic - many people died. We were all required to put on masks when we went out of doors to keep from getting the germs.

Money was scarce and script was used. I remember Mother making and selling butter. Hers was especially popular because she heaped up the butter mold thus giving about a pound and a quarter instead of the usual pound. One day I took some to a store to sell, called 'Petty's', and when the clerk asked me if I wanted money or script, I told him script was alright. I will never forget how angry mother was with me for taking 'Petty Script' when I could have gotten money.

"Our next move was to Star Ranch. This period seemed one of complete happiness for me. There was a railroad that ran through the ranch and nearby was a section house in which a small boy lived about my age who seemed to have the same interests as I. We made slingshots and played we were big hunters. We shot mourning doves off their nests, hoot owls, caught marsh frogs, fished in the reservoir for fish (mostly carp) which most people considered were unedible but which we roasted and ate everything. Later I was given a twenty-two rifle and added ducks and rabbits to my game bag. I was also given a pony and the job of herding the cows.

"It was customary for the railroad to use the strip of land that passed through our ranch as a rest stop for sheep that were being shipped to market. In the spring there were many lambs which the owners considered nuisance value since they had to be hand-fed, so they gave them to us kids. We considered them fine pets until we discovered they had ringworm, and guess what? Our farm hand had a cure for this. He burned cotton cloth on a cold axe blade which formed a sort of tar which was applied to the ringworm. I assume this worked, since all went well until the lambs were grown. But then Father considered them <span id="page-846"></span>good food and we were supposed to eat heartily.

"Provo was our next move. Here I attended three different schools in a period of two years, and here again we had an epidemic of influenza. I had it, as well as the rest of the family. As I felt better, I made my first trip out to the chicken coop to gather eggs - I was in bed a good week after.

"Here I remember making skis out of old barrel staves, carrying them to the top of the chicken coop roof and then skiing down. There was quite a drop at the bottom but I got quite expert at this. I remember also of taking my toy sled into the canyon and cutting and bringing home a Christmas tree.

"In the spring another boy and I gathered watercress in the streams above Provo. We washed, tied, and peddled it. At every opportunity I'd go fishing from the bridge that crosses the Provo River. My tackle consisted of a willow, some string, and a fishing hook. With these I was able to catch trout, blue gills, suckers, chubs and bullheads.

"We moved to Salt Lake City and located on Twenty-first South where the Jordan River made a bend and crossed it. We had two or three acres of ground. The place was quite run down and we had lots of work pruning, gardening, repairing the
barn, etc. I remember a big apple tree full of redwing black birds who stopped to rest as they migrated south for winter. Our place was located near Redwood Road along which sheep were driven from winter range to summer range in the mountains. This spring, after the shearing of the sheep, the weather became so wet and cold that a good many ewes with lambs nearly froze to death. We were able to buy six ewes for $1.00 each, including nine lambs. We hauled them home in the back of our old touring car, wrapped blankets around them and got them warm and fed them. Out of the whole bunch we only lost one ewe. We kept them until fall and sold all of them for $140.00.

"We made us a nice garden. There were a lot of old rhubarb plants in the garden which we separated and transplanted. We had more than we <span id="page-847"></span>had a use for, so I harvested it, did it up in one pound and two pound bunches and peddled it. While working in the garden one morning I saw my first pheasant rooster standing in the plowed ground. The sun was shining on his breast - he was beautiful. At this time we also added a black cow to our homestead. There were lots of fish in the river so I fished a great deal. I don't believe I ever finished school this year.

"We moved to a house on State Street just back of the McKinley School. We had quite a bit of ground and many big trees, mostly poplar which we topped or cut down completely, so we had to cut them up into firewood. We also had a big garden but I managed to still find time to fish and hunt around the Jordan River, Mill Creek, Decker's Lake and an old slough on the church farm. That summer Father, my brothers and I set out in an old Model T Ford and went as far as Idaho, Montana and Yellowstone Park looking for projects to work. For us boys it was a real pleasure trip.

"The fall found us back in Salt Lake for school. I began to trap muskrats and skunks. I would take the streetcar every night after school to Draper, check my traps and skin any animals I had caught. I could take my muskrat pelts on the streetcar but they would not allow me to bring the skunk pelts, so I would leave them and bring them home on my back once a week - a walk of about 17 miles. I remember sometimes getting on the streetcar after skinning the skunks, I would walk to the back of the car and almost simultaneously the people would move to the front and open the windows wide. I sold my pelts to the American Hide and Fur Company. This I did in winter. In the spring I worked in the fields for the Italian truck gardeners. We planted carrots, onions and celery and weeded the gardens. In summer we harvested the vegetables and put them into pits. In fall we washed them and prepared them for market. I made a total of fifteen cents when I worked there after school and thirty-five cents for a whole day on Saturdays.

"In the sixth grade I began to dislike school. I was receiving poor grades in spelling, arithmetic <span id="page-848"></span>and reading. I remember being very angry in a spelling test when I spelled 'donut' and the teacher said it was wrong. I took her over to the window and pointed out to her a sign spelling it this way over a doughnut shop. During the latter part of my seventh year at school my teacher and I seemed to have a difference of opinion as to classroom conduct. Well, to straighten out the difficulty I was to stay each night after school and copy ten pages of an encyclopedia. I had no desire to become afflicted with writer's cramp or to have increased knowledge, so I made plans to escape the ordeal. After the rest of the class had been excused for the afternoon and the teacher had stepped from the room, I crawled through the window and down the fire escape and went home. That night I began thinking. I was afraid to go back to school next morning and I knew if I didn't go back my parents would hear what I had done. If they did, I would have worse than writer's cramp. Finally, I decided to leave home. I hitchhiked to Idaho Falls. It took me two or three days to get there. I found a job there working on a farm and worked until summer (fishing time) and then I hitchhiked to Yellowstone and Jackson Hole. I slept out and enjoyed the out of doors for a month. While on this spree, I met a sheepherder in Island Park, west of Yellowstone. He told me the people he worked for needed a camp tender. I applied at Hamilton Brothers and they hired me. I had plenty of opportunity to experiment with camp cooking. I varied the mutton diet with trout, grouse, and deer that I furnished.

"I worked for them until the sheep were taken off summer range and then set off to Parker, Idaho, and worked in the potato harvest that fall. Then for a while I trapped mink, muskrats, coyotes, and did odd jobs for a farmer, who turned out to be a Mormon Bishop and an old student of my father. Through our conversation he found out who I was and reported my whereabouts to my parents. At Christmas time he and his brother took me home.

"Father made arrangements with the LDS School to not hold me back to 7th grade but to let me go onto Jr. High School. I took all the usual <span id="page-849"></span>things plus Seminary. I didn't do well in most of my subjects but I liked Seminary because we studied Exodus, which involved the Children of Israel traveling through the wilderness living off the land and eating manna and quail. I finished that school year and then returned to Idaho Falls and worked on a farm all that summer and until after school had started the next fall.

"I then returned to Salt Lake and started school again. This time it was a South Jr. High School. This winter I went back to trapping and also did real well in school. I won first place in a writing competition and had the opportunity to read my paper at the assembly for the whole school. I also was in the operetta and was the only baritone, as I was the only boy whose voice had changed. I needed a car for my work with the traps. We had an old car in the garage in need of repairs. I got it all fixed up but I lost out to Wendell who had just returned from his mission and took possession of the car to go courting.

"That summer I chauffeured my Dad to California. We worked with mining claims in San Gabriel Canyon. That fall we returned to Salt Lake City and I to the South Jr. High. The following spring I came back to California. I told Father I wanted to stay here and work for a sporting goods place. We weren't successful in finding this type of work, but I got a job at Glendale Small Animal Hospital that summer and continued on for the rest of the year. The following fall I worked for the hospital in the mornings before I went to Herbert Hoover High School, and for a supply company after school. On Saturdays I worked for the Humane Society taking the dead animals down to the rendering plant. At this time I bought a little apple green Chevrolet roadster with a rumble seat. I had a tin box which fit in the rumble seat where I carried the dead dogs. The first trip in my new car I had an accident, with dead dogs flying every which way. People gathered and were feeling so sorry for my poor little dogs that had been killed; little did they know that the dogs had been dead for several days. 

<span id="page-850"></span>"This year I really took an interest in school. I received straight A's and again I sang in the school operetta. I went to school here for two years but still lacked credit to graduate. I had become interested in veterinary medicine and so I applied to Washington State College for entrance. They accepted me and said to come to the college and I could make up the credit. I enrolled in the Pullman High School and took part time work at the College. I graduated from high school there. I had met some boys at the Veterinary Hospital in Glendale who were also attending Washington State College in the school of Veterinary Medicine, so five of us batched together. I did the cooking and they did the housework. That summer I came back to California and went to work for the Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital for Dr. Fosbinder. This was the spring of 1932, a time of depression when wages were low. I never made over $100.00 a month until I graduated with my D.V.M. degree. My free time was Wednesday and Friday nights and every other Sunday. I enjoyed my work here. I drove the ambulance and really learned the city well. I met a lot of famous stars in this way.

"This fall I met my girl through my sister who was here going to Art Center school. After dating her for three months she left for San Francisco. Once a month I went to visit her there. I would drive all night Saturday after work, spend Sunday with her, then drive all night Sunday night to get back in time for work Monday morning. On one telephone call to San Francisco, I had carefully looked up the rate (ninety cents for three minutes), I just naturally assumed that the operator would tell me when the three minutes were up. As time went by and she didn't tell me I thought she had forgotten and that I was talking for free. I was floored when she called back to verify my $12.50 call.

"Nov. 17, 1934 my brother Wendell, who was then a Mormon Bishop, married us at his home in Los Angeles. He managed to misspell her last name so we really never knew whether we were legally married until we went through the Los Angeles Temple twenty-seven years and <span id="page-851"></span>six children later (15 Apr. 1961). (His wife is the former Velda Ruth Johnson, born 4 Jan. 1912 in Duchesne, Utah to Oscar Emanuel and Sophia Deseret Baldwin Johnson).

"I wanted to get back to college and get my degree. Two years passed while Velda and I worked together toward achieving this goal. She managed a ten unit court in exchange for our apartment and utilities. I kept on at the hospital. In Feb. 1936 our first son, Steven, was born. September of 1937 found us in Pullman, Washington with our hard earned savings. We hoped with careful handling and my working all vacations that this would see us through school. In Dec. 1937 our son Kent was born, and by the end of this school year we had used over half of our savings. In the light of this situation, Velda decided to go to work the following fall. She applied for and got a position as secretary of the National Youth Administration at the college. This she did until I graduated in 1942 with my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. During the time while we were saving to go back to school, the curriculum had changed from a four to a five year course - I had to go the five years.

"School was a tremendous satisfaction to me. My record throughout the entire five years was almost straight A's. This made it possible for me to get into the scholarship honorary, Phi Kappa Phi, the Veterinary Medicine honorary Alpha Psi, and the Biological honorary Phi Sigma.

"After graduation I returned to California with my family, and the Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital - this time as a Doctor. I worked for Dr. Fosbinder for $500.00 a month for six months and then went into partnership with him. In 1944
I bought the business from Dr. Fosbinder for $10,000 and leased the buildings and grounds from him. The years that followed were very demanding; I worked long hours. Sometimes I had an assistant and sometimes I worked alone but we usually found time for a two week vacation. This became somewhat of a custom: We met at my sister Edythe's home in Mill Creek Canyon, Salt Lake City, with all my brothers and sisters and <span id="page-852"></span>their families and proceeded in a caravan to Sheridan, Montana, Yellowstone and the Glacier Park area. Our children loved this association with their cousins and it has been a means of keeping our families close through the years.

"In 1943 our third son, Philip, was born and in 1948 we were delighted when our first girl, Kathleen, was born. She truly seemed like a little princess to us after having three boys. This happiness ended abruptly when she was taken
from us just three days before her third birthday. As time went on we managed to pick up the pieces and tried to establish a firm footing again. This was helped by the birth of our fourth son, Paul, in Jan. 1953. He was a bright, busy, interested little boy and soon had our household humming again. In 1958 we were blessed with another boy whom we named Allen.

"Meanwhile, in 1950, I bought the hospital outright for $46,000.00. It took us ten years to pay for it - this is the way Dr. Fosbinder wanted it set up or I'm sure we could have managed it sooner. I also found a fascinating new hobby -
photography. Lots of new interests came into our lives when in 1961 we went through the Temple, taking all our sons with us. My mother and most of my brothers and sisters went with us. We had our daughter sealed to us also at that time.

"I retired in 1963 - sold my business and leased the building and ground. We are able to live from this income. Shortly after retiring I joined the Sierra Club. I have always been interested in conservation. I have taken many wonderful trips with this club, including two to Alaska, some in Mexico, and many backpack trips in the Sierras. Also, all through the years I have maintained my interest in hunting and fishing as well as my photography and have traveled quite extensively. I have had wonderful luck with my colored slides and have a vast library of them. I have received quite a lot of recognition with them from the Southern California Camera Club. I have also shown them to many groups of people. It has been a real source of pleasure to us as a family in our entertaining. 

<span id="page-853"></span>"Our three oldest boys graduated from the University of Southern California - Steven from Medical School, Kent and Philip from Dental. Paul is looking forward to being an Orthodontist, while Allen is delightful, perverse and stubborn, but looks more like me than any child we have and is probably made up just like me. We love them all dearly.

"We are still living in our same little house in the San Fernando Valley. We appreciated the comfort and peace we feel in our home. We have quite a lot of freedom through the day while the two younger boys are at school, and we take in many interests, such as: Yachts in the harbor, new model homes, sport shows, musicals, art exhibits, etc. Velda and I find that we enjoy the same things. We are interested in our church activities and are hoping to buy us a new camper a year from now and really see the world. I feel much as the quotation in Psalms: 'My cup runneth over'".

To bring this story up to date, they did buy the new camper - and guess what? They sold out in California and bought a new home in Provo, Utah, moving the first of this year, 1969. They are now busy furnishing their home, finishing the
basement and landscaping the grounds. Welcome to Provo dear Cousins!

## Henry Marvin Christensen 

(42) Henry Marvin Christensen (3) was born
in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah 1 Oct. 1911 in the
family home in the southwest part of town, which
house is still standing (1969).

When he was about ten years old his family
moved to a farm on the "Rocky Point" a mile or so
west of town, because of financial reverses. Here
his father fed livestock and Marvin was expected
to help where he could. He attended public school
in Gunnison, which was a good walk from the farm.
When he was going on fifteen his father passed away
(1926) and a little over a year later his mother, two
brothers, Virgil and Don and himself moved to
Fayette, Utah, about six miles north of Gunnison
to live with his mother's brother, Uncle Henry
Bartholomew, who was a widower with small sons
of his own. This move ended Marvin's formal
schooling.

Like his brothers, Marvin loved to hunt and
fish and many trips to mountains, meadows and
<span id="page-855"></span>
streams were enjoyed by them for these purposes.
The Christensen boys were welcomed by the young
people of the small village of Fayette and they had
lots of good times. Marvin began keeping company
with a local girl, Elva Eliza Olsen (born 23 Oct.
1912 in Fayette to Joseph and Dora Mellor Olsen).
The two were married in the Manti Temple 1 July
1931, when Elva was going on nineteen and Marvin
was not yet twenty.

The couple procured a farm west of Fayette
where Marvin farmed but they lived in Fayette.
And though Marvin was brought up as a farmer,
he had a liking and talent for building also. He
built the home they lived in - tore down an old
rock church storehouse and used that rock for the
walls. He and Elva had five children, two dying
soon after their births. But shortly after fourteen
years of marriage the couple were divorced, 17
Aug. 1945. The three surviving children, ages
thirteen to seven, went with Elva, who stayed in
the area. She also received the home and farm.
Later she remarried and moved to Salina, Utah.

Marvin left Fayette and moved north to the
area of Lehi, Utah, where he operated a church
farm for a few years. During these past years he
has had a truck service and done some building of
homes, etc. It is said he built the home in Lehi
where he and his second wife now live. He 
remarried 26 Feb. 1946 in Elko, Nevada a young
divorcee, Mrs. Lois Marie Ferguson Winterton
(born 21 Apr. 1922 in Sandy, Utah to Stanley W.
and Dorothy Larson Ferguson). Lois had two
young sons, ages seven and almost five. Marvin
raised these boys until they married and left the
home, but he never adopted them. He and Lois
have four children of their own, three sons and
one daughter.

Marvin, like the other sons of Joseph and
Roxie Christensen, is a big fellow. He has gone
into building almost wholly now as an occupation - houses, 
garages, fireplaces - and what have you.
The four children are still at home and all teenagers
together and all in school. Being father of nine
children and stepfather of two others, has kept him
busy over the years. There have been thorns and
<span id="page-856"></span>
thistles along the way but also plenty of sunshine
and roses. And though his formal schooling stopped
when he moved from Gunnison some forty-two years
ago, his education in the "University of Hard
Knocks" has continued and will continue to go on to
the end, as it will for us all. For life itself is a
schooling and we are all pupils and, whether we
wish to admit it or not, we are all looking towards
our own day of graduation.

## Phillip Van Buren Christensen 

(43) Phillip Van Buren Christensen (4) was
born 23 Oct. 1911 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah. He
writes of his own life thus:-- "I was told that when
I was blessed (7 July 1912 by Joseph H. Carpenter)
I was given about all of the family names that were
left over on my mother's side of the family. This
has been quite a name to carry and I wonder so
often if I have done it justice. I remember very
little of my early childhood although I remember
generally my mother who died when I was nearing
age five.

"When she died I was very lonesome and
missed her greatly. I recall shortly after her
death having been told that she had gone to Heaven.
We had a beautiful staircase in our home in Manti
and I remember I climbed onto its second landing
on a beautiful moonlight night and looked out of the
small ornamental window to the east there and 
knew that I could see my mother's face up there
by the moon. I also recall another time when I
felt so alone without her that I somehow got outside
on a cold, snowy night and trailed over to Aunt |
Claytie Riddle's in foot deep snow in my bare feet
and nightgown, looking for Mother.

"I always wanted a horse and though, as I
grew bigger, I usually had the use of one of
Dad's - Prince, Duke, Queen, Pigeon, Nig,
Brownie, Stride-on, etc., yet I never recall
<span id="page-858"></span>
owning one of my own until after I was married and
purchased one myself - and this for my daughter.
I remember when my cousins Joe Neff, Ralph and
Warren Riddle and myself, and perhaps others,
took the long hikes down to the Sanpitch River to
go fishing. We would fish in the 'black hole' and
catch chubs and occasionally a carp or sucker.
We were mighty proud fishermen, and after the
warm day wore on we would go swimming in the
'bloack hole'. It didn't seem to bother us that 
there were dead sheep and likely a dead cow in
the river just above where we swam. Then came
the long trek home. As we came up from the river,
hot, tired and hungry, we would often talk about
how wonderful it would be, as we rounded the next
bend, if we would see a saddled horse for each of
us tied there and our names printed on the saddles.
What dreams we had - even in daylight!

"I recall when Grandfather Snow used to take
me fishing, and day of all days would be when he
would call up in the afternoon the day before such
an event and say, 'Kaiser' - that's what they called
me along about the latter part of World War I. He'd
say, 'Kaiser, dig some worms and I'll be down to
get you at 6:00 o'clock in the morning'. Sure
enough, at 6:00 o'clock here would come Grandfather
driving the buggy and I usually had the worms. We
had the long bamboo fishing poles with linen lines
and cork bobbers then. Those days when we went
to the reservoir fishing were great times in my
life. I got to drive the horse and buggy a good deal
of the way. We would usually spend a wonderful day
fishing. One time I left my pole for a moment, held
by a stick; apparently a large carp got hold of the
hook and pulled pole and all out into the water and
I was unable to get it back. I imagined that the
culprit was the biggest fish in the whole reservoir.

"When Grandfather got his Chevrolet automobile 
it was a great day too, but I must confess that
I was a bit apprehensive of some of the rides I took
with him. He didn't learn to drive until he was in
his seventies and then he was a 'real driver’. If
he ever hit a bad place in the road he felt that the
best way was to speed up and get over it in a hurry.
One time coming down Manti Canyon he ran right
<span id="page-859"></span>
up on the side of a hill and I thought for sure we
were going to be tipped over. He was wonderful
to us grandkids though. Many were the times that
he did with us the things so dear to youngsters'
hearts.

"Then came the day when I was about eight-and-a-half 
years old and Aunt Myrtle joined the
family. I was a rather sickly looking little fellow
and she certainly took me in hand. I have so much
to thank her for over the years. She has truly been
a second mother to me. How fortunate we all have
been to have had the inspiration, encouragement,
example, loving service and devotion of this dear
woman in our lives.

"I remember trips out to the Gunnison Ranch
with Father and the times we gigged carp in the old
sloughs there. Then there were the days spent at
Flat Canyon, hoeing corn and herding sheep. I was
quite young but I did drive the team from Manti to
Flat Canyon and back many times during the last
summer or two that we lived at Manti. One time,
the day before the Fourth of July, I was out there
with my older brother Hale. We wanted to be in
Manti for the celebration next day. Toward afternoon
Hale said that we were going to Manti. We
decided to ride up over the mountains and were 
thrilled with the prospects of the adventure.
About 2:00 o'clock next morning we got up, saddled
two horses and started over the mountains toward
Manti. We arrived at the old reservoir west of
there about daybreak and finally made our way
home for that wonderful Fourth of July.

"Another time Dad said he would take
Marshall, Sherman, Hale and me to Fish Lake if
I would get the team in with a load of hay from
Flat Canyon at a given time. I had Dad's big black
team, Dan and Bess, and I recall how much they
liked to trot. I had a small jag of hay on the wagon
and I let the team trot most of the way from Flat
Canyon to Manti. I believe I made the whole thirty
miles in less than six hours, a record for a team
as far as I was concerned. I used to haul loads of
potatoes and grain, besides hay from Flat Canyon
to Manti for Father. I remember earlier, when I
was about ten years old, I used to drive our cows
<span id="page-860"></span>
down to the lane west of Manti, herd them there
during the daytime and bring them back in the evening. 
It seems that even as a young boy I always
had some responsibility. Father saw to it that I
learned to work.

"The greatest times were when Father took
us to the mountains. I recall once when he told me
that if I would get a load of potatoes in from the
Flat Canyon ranch that he would take me deer
hunting. I did and we went up Manti Canyon and
camped over night and got up early next morning
before it was light, had our breakfast around the
campfire, then started out looking for deer. I
remember that we saw something white moving
through the timber and Father said though we
didn't see a deer on that trip we saw the tail of one.

"In August 1925 came the move from Manti
to Provo, and since the house Dad had arranged
for us there was not quite ready, we lived for a
few weeks with some of Aunt Myrtle's relatives.
Here I met Gilbert Tanner, who was two days
younger than I, and we became steadfast friends.
We used to kid each other a lot, saying I was the
'old man' and he was the 'youngster'. I made some
other wonderful friends the nine months we lived
in Provo. I particularly recall my association in
Troop 10 of the Scouts in Manavu Ward with Deb
Tregeagle as Scout Master. I always was sorry
that I didn't get to complete my scout work under
Deb. But then came the move to the farm at Orem.

"I had attended Manti High School my freshman 
year and then attended Provo High as a sophomore.
I was quite small in stature when I went up
to Orem High School with Father to get registered
as a junior. Mrs. Cunningham was helping with
the registration and stated that she didn't teach the
freshmen anymore. It was with some indignation
that I told her I was a junior. She taught me English
that year and was a wonderful teacher. I finished
high school in 1928 and that fall started at the BYU.
I weighed slightly over 100 pounds at the time.

"I only went to college about six weeks that
first year and then quit and worked on the farm
there in Orem. The next year I attended BYU for
<span id="page-861"></span>
two quarters and again ran the farm. The third
year I went two quarters to the University of Utah
and then came back to work on the farm. By this
time my brother Sherman was married and he and
Lois kindly invited me to come back and stay with
them, so I took the bus to Washington D. C. I
took some training at the Boyd Business University
in shorthand and typing, worked at the Hot Shoppe
waiting on the curb and later as 'curb manager',
and then went to work out at the airport restaurant.
By June I was mighty homesick and since a friend
from Orem, Leo Poulsen, was just returning from
a mission to Sweden and had stopped in at Washington 
to say hello, I rode back to Provo with him and
some other fellows.

"I started college again at BYU that next fall.
During the summer I worked on the place in Orem,
excepting for about a month when I went up to Tulsa,
Wyoming and worked in the hay for McGuinnes
Livestock Co., running what they called a scatter-rake.
I spent three more late summers up there
working in the hay for that company, alternating
it with college and working on our Orem place.
After seven years I finally graduated from college,
June 1935.

"That fall I returned to Washington D. C.
We had Democratic representatives in the capitol
then and all of them seemed to know of my Republican 
background. It seemed next to impossible 
for me to get a job although I had located one that
was available and to my liking with the Resettlement 
Administration. I had to get a clearance 
from the Democratic party and our Utah representatives 
were not about to give me one. I went into the
office of Senator O'Mahoney of Wyoming, and since
I had worked for a period of time in Wyoming I told
him of my position. The Senator referred me to
his secretary, Mr. Green. After hearing my problem 
this fine gentleman made a phone call to the
Resettlement Administration in my behalf and after
a long conversation I heard him say. ‘I don't give
a damn - give this young man a job!' Needless to
say, I received the job and worked in the travel
audit department.

"Starting the second semester, which began
<span id="page-862"></span>
in Feb. 1936, I went to law school at George Washington 
University, attending at nights from 7:00 |
o'clock to 9:30 and working days for the Resettlement 
Administration. It was difficult for me to
study late at nights so I used to get up at 4:00
o'clock each morning and do my studying when my
mind was clear. After school was out, the early
summer of 1937, I was sent down to work at the
regional field office in Raleigh, North Carolina
for three months. I was able to rent a lovely room
in a large southern home. But I returned to Washington D. C. 
for work and school that fall. It was
during that year that I attended, with a group from
Utah, a White House reception given by President
Roosevelt. A young lady, who worked in the office
of Congressman J. Will Robinson from Utah, whose
name I have forgotten, invited me to go. Although
I never had any high regard for President Roosevelt,
I'll never forget how impressed I was as he walked
by with his cane, supported by a member of his 
family, his chin out as the band played 'Hail to The
Chief'. I was close enough to touch the President
and I was impressed by the magnitude of the office
and the pomp and color that was at the White House
that night.

"I had an opportunity to be transfered from
Washington to the regional office in San Francisco
and although my law school plans had to be changed,
I jumped at the chance. I was able to purchase a
1935 Ford four-door sedan automobile that had been
a taxi, for $200.00. As soon as school was out the
spring of 1938, I hauled out a few passengers to
Utah and then drove on to San Francisco. Here I
arranged to take one of the examinations that I was
not able to take at George Washington University
through the University of San Francisco and came
out with an "A". I went to night school at the University 
of San Francisco, then called St. Ignatius
College. After a year there my work for the government
was terminated and the mountains and canyons
in Utah again beckoned me.

"At this time Father was interested in the
Red Hills Mining Co., the Grand Deposit Mining
Co., and other mining interests through one Paul
Lyon. I had often wondered why the apparent
<span id="page-863"></span>
tremendous amount of money Father invested was
not more productive. But anyway, I went to work
for the Grand Deposit Mining Co., which was
about seventy miles northeast from Ely, Nevada.
It was quite an experience going down the shaft and
working in the mine. I had the usual trying experiences 
of a 'green hand'. My main partner was a
fellow who had had some trouble with the Juvenile
Court and was on probation and he didn't spare me.
During the summer Father came out to the mine on
different occasions and we talked about my continuing 
on at law school. He told me that he would
help me but he wanted me to go full time. At the
end of the summer I was paid partly in cash and 
partly in mining stock for my work; the latter I
sold at quite a disadvantage. 

"While working in San Francisco I had purchased 
a 1938 Oldsmobile. During my school that
winter at the University of Utah I was forced to
sell it and took in as part payment an old Austin.
That summer of 1940 I drove it up to Wyoming to
work for the livestock company again and took my
younger brother Cullen and two other fellows with
me. I don't recall how much money I was able to
save from my summer's work but though it was
not a great deal it did help a little in getting 
started back to school at the U of U that late fall.
I had pretty well concluded my law studies at the 
U of U by Christmas of 1940, but had one or two
other classes I had to take. Father was still
helping me financially but I did what work I could.

"It was in the spring of 1940 that I met 
Gwen - first at the home of Mrs. Pardoe when I interrupted
one of her private dramatic lessons and another 
time in Keeleys on East Center Street. And then
I saw her leading the Richfield Drum and Bugle 
Corps in some function at BYU. I recall her long
black hair, ready smile and her beauty. I had 
been with girls before and had thought I was in
love but I knew this was the real thing. That
summer I went down to see her at her home in
Richfield on one or two occasions, before going
to Wyoming. And of course after school started
I came down from Salt Lake to Provo to see her
as often as possible, since she was again attending
<span id="page-864"></span>
BYU. We became engaged just before Christmas.
I recall well that night. We were in an old Plymouth 
coupe that I then had, in which I used some
sort of alcohol base as an anti-freeze. The night
was cold and we were driving over toward Spanish
Fork when the alcohol boiled out of the radiator
somewhat and there was a short in the wiring and
the car caught fire. This was quite something to
have happen on our engagement night.

"The Second World War was brewing in
Europe and conditions were mighty uncertain; and
although I was doing a little work after Christmas
in the law office with Dad and Sherman, I talked to
them and told them I was going to apply to the FBI
for a position as special agent. I will never forget
the long telegram I received just after the first of
that year 1941, offering the sum of $3,200.00 a
year for this position in the FBI. I immediately
replied that I would take the job. Gwen and I discussed 
my leaving, and since she was finishing her
last year at college we didn't plan on being married
until it was over. In talking of my future office
assignments she stated that she didn't care where
we went if it were not a hot place like New Orleans.

"I arrived in Washington D. C. Mar. 3, 1941,
at the Justice Building. I recall the beautiful brief
case, the fine looking men, all strangers to me,
and my taking my place among them in the big,
beautiful room. I was thrilled as my name,
appearing alphabetically on the list between a
Carlson and a Dutwyler, was read out and I was
sworn in and received my brief case. A 38 revolver
was in it, along with volumes of rules, regulations
and instructions. My counselor was Jeptha Rogers,
a tall Texan. General instructions were given and
we were told to go out and buy some range clothing
and be back to leave for the Marine base at Quantico
by bus that evening. The training was rather short,
seven weeks, but thorough and concentrated and
consisted of firearms use, photography, jujitsu,
fingerprinting, etc.

"The day of greatest excitement came when
we received our office assignments, and guess
what? I was assigned to New Orleans. I called
Gwen about it as soon as I could and she relieved
<span id="page-865"></span>
my apprehensions by saying it didn't matter and
that would be wonderful. We decided we would be
married in June as soon as her school was out and
she could come to New Orleans, since I was not
allowed time off."

Phillip was married 19 June 1941 in New
Orleans, Louisiana, to Gwen Johnson (b. 1 Sep.
1918 in Sigurd, Utah to Joseph B. and Mida
Dastrup Johnson). Gwen tells of riding down by
car to New Orleans with her future father-in-law
A. H. Christensen and her future sisters-in-law
Norma Christensen and Elaine C. Southwick, and
what a wonderful time the sixty-nine year old
gentleman showed his three companions. She
said she almost felt that she had her honeymoon
before her marriage instead of after. The wedding
itself was held in a large southern ancestral mansion 
owned by a member of the branch of the LDS
church there. A number of the branch members
took over full arrangements for the wedding and
open house which followed, complete with music,
flowers, wedding cake and all, which seemed to
be overseen by framed pictures of ancient ancestors
of the mansion's owners looking down from their
places of honor on the various walls. Norma and
Elaine stood with Gwen in the line and Father
Christensen and Phil's cousin, Marshall Neff,
stood up with him. The Branch president, 
Brother Evans, performed the ceremony which
was attended by the FBI special agents in the area
and their wives, together with a number of branch
members. Gwen, who was very near sighted, said
she left her glasses off for the occasion because
Phil didn't like her in them too much and so was
unable to get a good view of everyone or to identify
many of those in attendance afterwards.

Phil continues with the history:- "We took up
our residence in an apartment right next to cousin
Marshall and his wife Viola and they were so good
to us. Gwen, bless her heart, was alone a lot of
the time since I was away from home so much. It
was not until she obtained a job with the War
Department, working at the Port of Embarkation,
that some of that lonesomeness vanished.

"My work in New Orleans was fascinating.
<span id="page-866"></span>
When American became involved in the war, Dec.
1941, we agents were asked to round up the enemy
aliens who had been located and kept catalogued
through painstaking investigations done previously.
I had been assigned the job of going over all the
books and records of the Orcombantanti, which
was the association of Italian world war veterans,
which were mostly made up of speeches and reports
quite inflammable against the United States. The
president of this group was one Phillippe Bellipanni
and the secretary was Guiseppe Verderaime. We
were ordered to pick these two men up and have
them interned. When we closed in on Bellipanni
his wife had just had a baby, their first, and he
cried and swore in no uncertain terms that we
could cut his head off if he were not loyal to
America. We found out that most of the Italians
were very loyal to America but the story was
different with some of the German aliens who
were there. They were usually stoical, bitter and
strong in their convictions as to the right and
power of the Third Reich.

"I remember chasing a German newspaperman, 
suspected of being a spy, down the wrong
way of a one-way street as he attempted to get
away in his car. I recall on 12 Dec. 1941 that
another agent and I were sent down to the mouth
of the Mississippi River where the Gulf Refining
Co. had provided a beautiful boat and a guide for
the FBI. Our guide was named Felix Barrious
who spoke the Cajun language. On this trip
Barrious took us through the bayous at the river's
mouth, looking for Japanese fishermen supposed
to be in the area who were suspected of providing
information and help to Japanese and Germans who
might be entering the country illegally by way of
the Mississippi. We picked up a German alien
who was alleged to have made some statements
against President Roosevelt. He had a large knife
in his possession when we captured him, but of
course denied any allegiance to Germany. However, 
he was interned and sent to a detention camp
somewhere in Texas,

"We were looking specifically for a Japanese
fisherman nicknamed 'Tampico' because he had
<span id="page-867"></span>
jumped ship at Tampico, Mexico and come to
America. He ran a shrimp fishing outfit and his
boat was called the 'Tokyo'. It was difficult to
tell the Japanese from Philippinos. On a number
of boats we boarded to search, the occupants wore
large badges with 'I am Philippino' printed on them.
We finally located the Tokyo and asked for Tampico.
His men said he was supposed to come late in the
evening and pick up the day's catch of shrimp in a
truck with the name Tokyo printed on the side.
Four of us agents in two cars later staked out the
road leading to the fishing docks and sure enough,
about 10:00 p.m. the Tokyo truck came along. We
ran it off the road and found an American man 
driving 'Tampico's' truck. He stated that Tampico
was at his home in Algiers, just across the river
from New Orleans, and gave me his address. It
was midnight when we four agents arrived at
Tampico's but his lights were on. A peek in the
window revealed a Japanese-looking fellow standing 
in the middle of the kitchen floor beside his
packed suitcase. Two of us entered from the back
door and two from the front, and when we asked
Tampico where he was going he answered in
broken but understandable English that he knew he
was going to be picked up and possibly interned,
and since he didn't want people to think he was
trying to run away, he hired someone to run his
equipment, packed his bags, and was waiting
there at home to be picked up. Believe it or not -
we didn't - and interned him.

"There was a 'German Baron' and his very
lovely wife that we picked up shortly afterwards
in Baton Rouge. He was supposed to be in America
‘lassoing alligators'. The last I heard of him he
was head of the linen detail in an internment camp
in Texas. There were many other cases that kept
us on the go.

"The summer of 1942 I was transfered to
Indianapolis, Indiana, and our first child, Bryce,
was born there the spring of 1943. Here, among
others, I investigated a very involved case in
which some officers of the Anaconda Wire and
Cable Co. were charged with fraud. They were
suspected of circumvention of tests of cable and
<span id="page-868"></span>
wire used by the armed services. Although the
case of war fraud was uncontrovertably established,
the company itself was given a 'clean bill of health'.
The guilty officers pleaded guilty and were given
suspended sentences, but there was much bitterness
and criticism because they were not sent to jail. It
was while working on this case that I first became
acquainted with Tom Clark, Justice of the United
States Supreme Court, who was head of the war
fraud unit of the dept.

"We subsequently moved to Fort Wayne,
Indiana, where I became resident agent, which was
a wonderful job. We were there almost a year and
liked it, although our living accomodations left
much to be desired. I was involved in investigations 
of communist activities in the large plants
in the area: International Harvester, Farnsworth
Television, General Electric, etc. I was transfered
out of Fort Wayne upon very short notice because of
threats being made against my safety. We were
sent to Newark, New Jersey in 1944. My work
there made me begin to yearn for the west. When
Bryce became ill we requested a transfer, although
we had many fast friends there among the agents
and their wives.

"Requests for transfers were not always
honored and often resulted in the cancelling of the
next raise. I will never forget the wonderful letter
of transfer written by Director Hoover, who wrote
something like this:- 'It has come to my attention
that due to the illness of your young son you have
requested a transfer to a warmer climate. I have
this day issued orders that you be immediately
transferred to Los Angeles, California,' and then
he gave his best wishes. Not long after our arrival
in Los Angeles I received a raise. Hoover was a
wonderful director. He was very strict but very
fair, and in meritorious cases he certainly did the
best he could to heip his employees.

"We bought a lovely three-bedroom home in
Los Angeles near the intersection of Pico and
Overland. I was assigned mostly to bank robbery
investigations. I recall with some nostalgia the
cases involving the 'Paper Bag Bandit', the 'Pin
Stripe Bandit', and the long search for a man called
<span id="page-869"></span>
'Mad Dog Horan', one of the most wanted fugitives
on the list of the FBI. I recall a most interesting
bank robbery case involving the theft of something
over $100,000.00 from two messengers from the
Hollywood State Bank taking money out to the Lockheed 
Aircraft Company. For a month Director
Hoover was in Los Angeles on this case. The
bandits were finally apprehended and most of the
money recovered, being dug up from a grave at
the Sawtelle Military Cemetery. This case was
written up in the July 1957 issue of Reader's Digest.

"I took and passed the California Bar examination.
I resigned from the Bureau in October 1945
and returned to Utah to practice law with my father,
my brother Sherman, and subsequently my younger
brother Cullen. At that time our firm was known
as Christensen & Christensen. After Sherman was
appointed Federal District Judge in Utah and Father
retired, Joseph Novak, Fred R. Paulson and Thomas
S. Taylor joined the firm. Novak subsequently
withdrew from the firm and it is now known as
Christensen, Paulson & Taylor, having four partners: 
Phillip V. Christensen, Cullen Y. Christensen, 
Ford R. Paulson, and Thomas S. Taylor,
and an associate, Robert L. Moody.

"Three daughters have been born to us since
we returned to Provo - Betty, Ann, and Mary.
All of our children have been a great joy to Gwen
and me. We are proud of their accomplishments
and appreciative of the contribution each of them
make in his or her own way to the happiness and
success of our family. Perhaps it was inevitable
that because Bryce was an FBI baby, born as a.
Hosier in Indiana, that he would become a special
agent of the FBI. After serving a mission in
Denmark, graduating from BYU, and marrying,
he received his appointment, was sworn in, and
received his training at the Marine Base in Quantico. 
He is now working as a special agent in the
area of Albany, New York and, among other things,
investigating bank robberies. Betty Lee is married
and at present lives in Butte, Montana. Her husband 
is an airline's pilot. She has recently taken
up oil painting and has painted some beautiful pictures. 
Ann won first place in piano competition
<span id="page-870"></span>
for beginners in the Utah State Fair in 1966;
placed second for Junior High age in the Baldwin
piano contest in 1966; won first place in the Baldwin
contest in 1968 in her age division and is now working 
on her own recital to be presented at BYU this
May of 1969. Mary Kathryn joins her sister Betty
in her love of horses, has her own horse and is
taking riding lessons. She also does wonderfully
well making things with her hands and is a great
reader. I wouldn't be surprised to see her excel
in literature somehow. She might even become a
writer.

"During the later years of my life, particularly 
since our return to the Provo area, the
church has come to mean a great deal in my life.
Gwen and I went to the Salt Lake Temple and were
sealed for eternity, 20 May 1948, also having our
first two children sealed to us at that time. The
other two were born in the covenant. While we
lived in the River Grove Ward in Provo's West
Utah Stake, I was a member of the High Council
and served as Building Fund Chairman for the
building of the new Rivergrove Ward chapel. Upon
moving to Orem in 1952 I was sustained as Second
Counselor to Bishop Laurence W. Palmer of the
Orem Eleventh Ward and served for two years.
In 1957 I was made Bishop of the Orem Nineteenth
Ward and served in that capacity until our family
moved back to Provo in 1962. For over three years
now I have served as a member of the East Sharon
Stake High Council under President Ben E. Lewis.
Each day I live I am more convinced that the only
way true happiness and joy can come is through
association in the church, through attempting to
live its principles, and mostly from gaining a true
testimony of the divinity of Christ and of his message 
to the world.

"Gwen has always had a staunch testimony of
the gospel and worked in the church organizations.
During our stay in the Provo Rivergrove Ward she
was Ward Relief Society President, being sustained
as such at age thirty. Shortly after we moved to
Orem in 1952 she was sustained as Sharon Stake
Relief Society President. She has taught many
classes in both Relief Society and Sunday School
<span id="page-871"></span>
and has always been an inspiration to those she
taught. At present she is serving as a Stake
Missionary in the East Sharon Stake, and together
with her companion, Sister Arlene Heaton, is doing 
a wonderful job. Life has been very good to
both of us and to our children and we do appreciate
all of our blessings so very much."

in Coalville of prematurity; buried Coalville.

## Weldon "D" Christensen

(45) Weldon "D" Christensen (7), the "D" 
just an initial like his father's, was born 7 Mar.
1912 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Just a few days
after Weldon turned four years old his family left
Gunnison by train and moved to a ranch some miles
east of Lyman, Wyoming, which was called "The
Oasis" by members of the family. They lived on
their homesteaded ranch in summers and in Lyman,
Wyoming, in winters for several years during which
time "firebugs" tried to burn them out and drive
<span id="page-872"></span>
them from the ranch. These were critical times
for their family as well as others of their Christensen 
relatives who had also taken out homestead
property on The Oasis.

Weldon attended school in Lyman and also in
Evanston and a short time in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Like so many of the grandsons of Laurs and Else
K. Christensen he grew to be a big fellow. He
often helped his father on the ranch near Lyman,
Wyoming, and was the only one of the children of
Louis and Florence Christensen who chose to make
a permanent home in the area. He has had a number 
of unusual, impressive experiences in his lifetime.
One was when the big boiler blew up on the
ranch and he and his father and others were miraculously 
saved. Another was when his father died.
These two experiences have been related earlier in
this book in the history of his father.

Weldon has told us something of his later life
in these words:-- "I married a girl named Beth
Blackner (b. 26 Feb. 1916 in Lyman, Wyoming to
Frank and Mary Margaret Syme Blackner) 11 Apr.
1932, first in Evanston, Wyoming and then thirteen
years later, 28 Nov. 1945, in the Salt Lake Temple.
We have a beautiful daughter, Colleen, born four
years after our civil marriage and sealed to us at
the time of our sealing in the temple. She married
a man named Wallace Hart and they have three
children. They are all very wonderful.

"I myself am 6 ft. tall, with brown hair and
brown eyes and weigh 225 lbs. My wife Beth is
5 ft. 4 inches tall, weighs 114 lbs. and has black
hair and brown eyes. We have enjoyed our marriage 
together and have had a very deep love for
each other, our daughter Colleen and her children
and also for her husband who has been a model
husband and a good father.

"We own our own home which we built ourselves, 
which is the third house we have built here
in Lyman. Beth is a secretary to the superintendent
of the Lyman High School and has been for more
than fifteen years. Before that she was a clerk in
the Lyman Mercantile here for fifteen years. I
myself have been mostly in carpentry work but ran
<span id="page-873"></span>
a school bus for years and raised chickens and
sold eggs on the side. I worked at Hill Field in
Utah for almost five years, first as a warehouse 
man and then as an aqua system man (aviation
gasoline with water pressure). Three others and
myself handied all the aviation gasoline on Hill
Air Force Base during the last world war, handling
hundreds of thousands of gallons of airplane gas
that serviced the planes and bombers that flew in
and out of the base.

"I was in the LDS Hospital for treatment some
time ago. The entrance to my heart and my left
lung aren't so good yet and I shake and am still
weak." A recent letter from Weldon's and Beth's
daughter, Colleen, contains the following:- "We
live just forty miles from Mother and Dad and have
close contact with them. Our children really enjoy
them. Dad has retired, due to a heart condition;
however, Mother is still working at the school as
secretary for the District, which keeps her really
busy even though she has an ulcer." 

Descendants of Weldon "D" Christensen and
Beth Blackner:

1. Colleen Christensen born 26 Dec. 1936 in
Lyman, Wyoming; md. 28 Mar, 1957 in Salt
Lake City, Utah, Herbert Wallace Hart (b. 27
May 1933 in Logan, Utah to Herbert Alexander
and Helen Covey Hart). Children, all born in
Salt Lake City, Utah: 

    1. Julia Hart b. 6 Mar. 1960.
    
    1. Steven Wallace Hart b. 23 Apr. 1962.

## Gorden Larsen Christensen

(46) Gorden Larsen Christensen (1) was
born 4 Apr. 1912 in Sait Lake City, Utah. He was
just five-and-a-half years old when his father died.
His sister Ivy writes of him:- "Gorden grew to be
a tall lad, six feet or more, with dark brown hair.
He always seemed to me to be a little shy but was
a great tease. He enjoyed sports and was very 
good at basketball and football. He did a little
boxing with his older brother Elmer. Everyone
joked about this because mother was always afraid
he would hurt Elmer, the older of the two by nearly
<span id="page-874"></span>
thirteen years but some smaller in stature. Gorden's
favorite pastime seemed to be reading. He would
sit for hours reading book after book. He was a
very clean living boy and always attended to his
church duties."

His brother Farrold says of him, "Gorden
had the normal love for life, people and sports.
He had graduated from the LDS High School in
Salt Lake City and was attending the LDS Business
College when he was stricken with appendicitis and
died soon after, 9 Jan. 1930, in Salt Lake of a
ruptured appendix. He was buried in Salt Lake City.

Supply Co."

Ellamae also writes other details of her 
life:- "While we lived in Goshen my brother A. Owen
married 'Pate', who has always been like a sister
to me. Aunt Vena and cousin Pearl also moved
there. I remember Grandma Christensen visiting
us and making a braided rug for Mother. I rode
by bus to high school in Payson where I graduated
in May 1930. That fall I enrolled at Henager Business 
College in Salt Lake City and attended nine
months. While there I was typist for a school
paper, 'The Dynamo', and won three awards, one
in penmanship and two in shorthand. I also headed
the typing list with 97 words a minute and three
errors.

"While at home in Payson next winter,
1931/32, Byron and I went to Nephi to learn the
MIA contest dance, a tango. I also started violin
lessons with Tresia Krauss but only took a few.
I took part in the MIA road show and was in the
MIA ladies' chorus contest. Iwas hired to take
in shorthand and transcribe the funeral services
of John Perkins. On the 8 Mar. 1932, I returned
to Salt Lake City to work in the office at Henager's
and to continue business school,
<span id="page-876"></span>

"My first full time job ($40.00 a month) was
with Utah-California Motor Lines in Salt Lake,
where I met my future husband, Harold Dorcheus
Krantz (b. 1 Feb. 1910 in Culdesac, Idaho (near
Ashton) to William Charles and Ellen Louise
Dorcheus Krantz). I called him 'Pat' and he was
tall, dark and handsome. At the time I lived with
Aunt Sarah Christensen, my father's sister, and
she was like a second mother to me. During this
time Cousin Lucile and I became good pals. We
gave each other nicknames, I called her 'Sally' -
she called me 'Jerry'. Hers didn't stick but I've
been Jerry ever since.

"I worked for two years, then Pat and I were
married at my parents' home in Payson, by Bishop
Cheever, 16 Dec, 1933. We lived in Salt Lake for
our first two years, during which time our first son,
Bill, was born. Looking at him for the first time
I felt that we had performed a miracle. He was an
exceptionally good baby and I spent most of my
time playing with him, since Pat was driving interstate 
so wasn't home very much. I wrote him a
letter each time he left home so he would get it
when he arrived at his destination.

"Then we moved to Maywood, California,
where Pat started working for an oil company.
Our son Mike was born in Bell, California. We
enjoyed our nine years in California and saw many
interesting places. It was like a dream seeing the
ocean for the first time; the boys loved to play on
the beach. While we were there, Edith, Heber
and family moved down to California, and also
Cliff and Rhea.

"To me, owning a home has always meant
security so I started working at Consolidated Steel
in Maywood to help get a down payment for one.
We bought a home in Whittier, Calif., in an orange
grove. I shall never forget the smell of orange
blossoms and night-blooming jasmine, nor the
plaintive song of the nightingale. Then came the
shock of Pearl Harbor and the blackouts. It was
especially tense on the coast. Consolidated Steel
built tank lighters, anti-aircraft guns and Liberty
ships. (We saw one of these launched). We decided
to sell our home and move back to Utah or Idaho.
<span id="page-877"></span>
So in the spring of 1943 we bought a home in
Idaho Falls,

"It seemed wonderful to see the streets
lighted again - I felt so good I wanted to run
instead of walk. We found the people so friendly
and interested, The boys and I became active in
the Fifth Ward. I taught Primary and was secretary 
in the Relief Society. I also served as Stake
Secretary for the Relief Societ. Pat joined in the
socials and dances. Then we bought a small farm
and moved six miles out of town. Pat and I were
both inexperienced but worked hard fixing up the
house and getting livestock and machinery. The
house was modern only to the extent that it had
water piped in. Later we found out that the well
went dry every spring for three months. We
painted, papered, built new cupboards and installed
hot water. Pat was working as a car salesman and
I decided to go to work to help with the finances.
We had a big garden so there was plenty of canning
to do. We had cows, pigs, chickens, rabbits, and
raised hay, grain and potatoes. We studied all the
government bulletins on farming. I could write a
book on our experiences on that farm.

"The boys had a mare and colt. They rode
the school bus to school and were active in all kinds
of sports and in music. Bill played the violin and
Mike sang and played the piano. Many times in
the winter the roads would be closed from drifting
snow. We made a comfortable home the nine years
we lived on the farm and have many happy 
memories - the boys loved it!

"We had an outstanding Bishop in the Taylor
Ward, Wesley Roberts, who had a wonderful
influence on our boys. I'm sure it was his teachings 
and inspiration that gave them the desire to
go on missions. We have always been proud of our
boys and wonder sometimes how we could have been
so lucky. They both filled missions, Bill in Mexico
and Mike in the New Engiand States. They both
graduated from college, Bill from the University
of Idaho in Forestry and Mike from the BYU in
Business Administration. They both had temple
marriages. Bill married Helen Sessions in the
Idaho Falls Temple and Mike married Judith Ann
<span id="page-878"></span>
Eastwood, whom he met at BYU, in the Los
Angeles Temple. As I write this history and
reflect on my life up to the present I am amazed
how time flies. It seems only yesterday our boys
were small. I look at them now with their little
families and think - 'there we were a few years
ago'.

"After the boys left home we sold the farm
and moved back to town. My husband works as a
driver-salesman for Challenge Creamery. I have
been working for the past some twenty years as
legal secretary for the firm Holden, Holden &
Kidwell. I have blue eyes, light brown hair, am
five feet four inches tall and weigh 120-125 lbs.,
which doesn't vary much. I love being home, like
housework, and am happy in the kitchen. I get
compliments on my cooking. I've always tried to
create a homey atmosphere so my family will love
coming home and will remember it with pleasure.

"I love to read and listen to sweet music - but 
also like activities such as dancing, hiking,
swimming and bicycle riding. I can completely
lose myself in gardening and it is pure joy for me
to be out in the hills fishing in a lively stream or
beautiful Lake Palisades. I love simple things like
the coziness of a fireside, the smell of clothes just
taken from the line, or of freshly baked bread. I
love the smell of willows on the river, lilacs in
bloom, and blue sky with billowy clouds. I especially 
like being grandma and shopping for the grandchildren.

"I love to take trips and see new country.
When the boys were young we took them on a
camping trip to Glacier National Park. After we
got our trailer we took Bill and Helen to Priest
Lake in northern Idaho and Mike and Judy through
Yellowstone Park. Pat and I have traveled through
all the western states, including a ferryboat ride
through the San Juan Islands to Victoria, and to
Mexico when Bill was released from his mission.
A Christmas or two ago we flew to Moscow, Idaho,
to be with Mike and his family and later we flew
back to Maryland to see Bill and his.

"Now here we are still in Idaho Falis, where
<span id="page-879"></span>
we own a nice home, a car, truck and house trailer
parked on the river in Swan Valley where we spend
weekends all summer. My husband shares his
great love of the outdoors with me. We fish, hike,
pick chokecherries and huckleberries, read or just
relax and enjoy the sound of the river. In the
winters we enjoy our cozy fireside and try to
accomplish special projects. We finished a hooked
rug last year and have an afghan to crochet now.
Pat keeps the house repaired and painted. There
are many things I would like to do. I would like to
learn to play the piano well and to sew my own
clothes. I've always thought I would like 
nursing - perhaps when I retire I'll do hospital work.
Perhaps someday also Pat and I can give our boys
their dearest wish and go through the temple."

## Alice Fern Christensen
<span id="page-880"></span>

(48) Alice Fern Christensen (7) was born
14 Apr. 1914 in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. She
lacked less than a month from turning two years
old when she moved with her parents to a ranch
near Lyman, Wyoming. She attended grade and
high school at Lyman, Evanston and Cheyenne,
Wyoming, graduating from Lyman High School
the spring of 1931.

Alice became an accomplished singer and
pianist. At one time she and her sister Marjorie
sang over the radio on their own program listed
as "Alice & Marj". She has played and sung in
night clubs and with bands. She herself writes of
this:- "I have worked at playing the piano in town
bands, night clubs, at style shows, luncheons, and
for Rotarians, Elks, Jaycees, etc. I also worked
at typing, my main job being with the Federal Civil
Service at the Sacramento Signal Depot (procedure
section) where in one year and two months I
achieved my goal by obtaining an Outstanding
Efficiency award as well at a Sustained Superior
award, which is considered quite an achievement
in Federal Civil Service.

"On 3 Nov. 1941, in Las Vegas, Nevada, I
was married to McNeil Frandsen (b. 23 Sep. 1915
in Elsinore, Utah to Alma F. and Petrea Nielson
Frandsen). We had a very happy marriage but
after twenty years and four months as man and
wife he died of cancer at Reno, Nevada, 10 Mar.
1962, after having suffered with this terrible disease
for one year and two months. He was buried 13 Mar.
1962 in Reno. After his death my former boss at
the Signal Depot in Sacramento, Robert G. Farrell,
made three different trips to Reno to try and get me
to go back there to work, but I didn't.

"I began playing dinner hour music at the
Nevada Hotel in Ely, Nevada, and that is where I
met my second husband, Joseph Robert Burns,
who was a cook and chef in Elko. We were married
in Elko 16 Jan. 1964. Later we moved to Tonapah,
Nevada where he did the same kind of work and I
played the piano at the 'Tonapah Club' there two
nights a week. I want you to know that I have had
the grandest mother, father, sisters and brothers
on earth - just a marvelous home life in my youth."
<span id="page-881"></span>

Alice and Joseph Burns were finally divorced
and she moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. She is at
present working at the University of Utah Printing
Department doing studies computing. She has no
descendants.

## Lucile Christensen

(49) Lucile Christensen (2) tells her own story in what she calls An Autobiography in Brief: "1914-1917 - Baby Years: I was born 17 May 1914 in Pleasant View (North Provo) Utah. My father wanted me named Mette Marie, a Danish name, but Mother prevailed and I was named Lucile. Father was appointed president of Ricks Academy in Rexburg, Idaho and we moved there when I was but a few months old. My recollections of this period are meager - but vivid. A leather clad Indian doll which I loved was taken and chewed up by the rats. We had a large collie dog which, in its playfulness, often knocked me down. My brothers shot a huge snowshoe rabbit which they carried suspended on a stick between them. 

"1917-1931 - Years of Our Migrations: 1917, we were at LaVerkin, Utah at the hot Springs for Edythe's health and Father's property speculation. 1918, we were at Hinckley, Utah where father headed the Millard Academy. Here Margaret was born. Luther and I explored the sage covered hills and found a horse caught in barbed wire. Much to Mother's concern I spent many hours on the respective backs of two mean horses, Fox and Dobbin. I fell from the seat of a disk-plow and cut open my upper lip. 1919, by summer we were living at Star Ranch near Mona, Utah. Father, understanding my insatiable longing for a horse, gave me a little sure-footed mare which I promptly named 'Queen'. For the full summer I remember no other companion than the beautiful animal on whose back I lived and dreamed. Father called me his 'Danish Fairy' and I thrived in the sunlight of this affectionate name until one day, when he took me to Santaquin with him, he pointed out an old bewhiskered man who passed us on the street, by saying, 'See, that is a Danishman'. Never again for me did 'Danish Fairy' call forth the same bright image as before. At Star I had an accident <span id="page-882"></span>with a razor blade which left me with a four inch scar on my left wrist. We got a victrola which played wonderful music. Something, unknown to me now, happened which caused me to entertain a fear of the dark which has never left me. 1920, during the winter in Provo, Utah, was the flu epidemic. We were all sick, Margaret had pneumonia and Dr. Hassler helped pull her through. 1921, Edythe left for school in Boston. 1923, we moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to a house around which flowed a bend of the Jordan River. Father was sick. I attended Cannon School and Cannon Ward Sunday School. Little sister Margaret was very frank and humiliated me when she told my teacher that we lived down by old Barnhage, the pig man, after I had been describing the beauties of our home by the river. Luther and I discovered a drowned man floating in the river. We also were caught on the Bamburger train bridge. We had just hooked a huge carp and had to abandon it, losing our rod and line as we scampered for our lives before the train. 1924, we were settled in a more comfortable home on 879 South Main Street. I attended McKinley School there. I remember an incident here which touched me. Luther kept a string of muskrat traps in Draper and sold the pelts. One night he had to walk clear from Draper with a skunk pelt because the conductor wouldn't let him ride the streetcar in his 'perfumed' condition. Wendell and Sheldon filled missions and later were married from this home, as Edythe was also. Father took us younger children on several summer trips to California, southern Utah parks and Yellowstone. Mother started a burial clothes business and Luther started to move in the direction of his career as a veterinary doctor. 1930, the house we were renting sold, so we moved nearly to 1740 So. Main, into another large home which Mother, with financial help from Luther, arranged to buy. Mother continued her sewing and also boarded and roomed teachers and secretaries to make our living. Father was sick with diabetes but continued to work and travel trying to make his investments and schemes pay off financially. I attended West High School where I met George F. Tate. I attended South High School my senior year, <span id="page-883"></span>the first year it was built. Father died 17 Dec. 1931.

"1932-1938 - Years of Change: For several years I had helped Edythe with her growing family, working on Saturdays and during the summers. I also worked at her husband's office (Drs. Robbins, Horne and Clawson). In the fall of 1933 I left for Los Angeles to attend the Art Center School, one of the country's foremost commercial art schools. I studied there until 1936, living the first year at Wendell's and the last two with Luther and Velda. My summers were spent in Salt Lake City. Edythe's health was very poor and Mother's financial burdens were heavy, so it was arranged that Mother would sell the home on Main Street and go to live with and care for Edythe and her five children. When my school was finished and I returned to Salt Lake, I worked as a window designer for Lerner Shops. During the years I had been away, George Tate had been at the Air Corps Technical School at Rantoul, Illinois. We had corresponded quite regularly, in fact carried on a pre-courtship relation which gave us a wonderful opportunity to exchange ideas and feelings. George came home in October of 1937 and after two wonderful weeks of getting to know each other better, we became engaged. When he left to return East, I wrote in a goodbye letter; 'When I think of eternity with you, it's none too long a time,' I have never had reason to feel otherwise. We were married in the Salt Lake Temple by his grandfather, George F. Richards (Pres. of the Quorum of the Twelve) for whom George had been named, 9 Sep. 1938. Three days later we left on a cross-country honeymoon to make our first home in Dayton, Ohio. (George Franklin Tate was born 25 July 1913 in Tooele, Utah, the son of George Lawrence and Alice Minerva Richards Tate).

"1938-1944 - Early Ohio Years: These were exciting, growing years with much opportunity for happiness. George progressed to the position of Project Engineer for aircraft engine instruments, and then to Unit Chief in charge of engine instrument development for the Air Force. He traveled extensively in this country and to Alaska. Together <span id="page-884"></span>we visited New York, Washington D.C., etc. Our two oldest daughters were born here, Kathryn and Barbara, the latter just three days before Pearl Harbor. We were active in church and served as local missionaries together. Our girls were frequently ill. Kathryn developed a tubercle in her lung and the doctors advised us to leave the damp climate and take them to California. We took their advice.

"1944-1946 - California Years: We moved to 5242 Alhambra Drive, Woodland Hills, in the hot, dry San Fernando Valley of California. The change worked wonders for our girls and for us also. George was re-employed by the government as Production Engineer in charge of aircraft instruments for the West coast, but after his Wright's Field experience in Ohio he became restless for more to do and looked around for something more challenging. Soon after moving here our son George was born, I cared for the children and spent much time with Sheldon's wife Mary, my long-time friend who lived just a few miles away in Tarzana, and with Luther's wife Velda, also a friend of long standing, who lived in Sherman Oaks. When George found more challenging employment it was with reluctance that we left our home in the Valley and moved to San Lorenzo Village across the bay from San Francisco. George was employed as Project Engineer for the development of a much needed recording instrument for the Air Force. Friden Calculating Machine Co. was his employer. The instrument was completed and under flight test at Wright Field when the war ended. The family now being in good health, George accepted another offer from Wright Field and we moved back to Dayton, Ohio, during the cold winter of 1945/46. During the process of the move, Kathryn fell from a car and sustained a head concussion. She was hospitalized for a week, administered to, and recovered without permanent injury.

"1946-1952 - Late Ohio Years: Our new home in Dayton was a large two story frame house from which we attended our Dayton Branch of the church and from which our children attended Jefferson School. The summer after our move <span id="page-885"></span>our youngest daughter, Susan, was born. Mother Christensen came to care for us, for after Susan's birth I was laid low with a severe case of mental, physical and spiritual depression which put me back in the hospital and then kept me low after my release. Faith, administrations, and the concerted prayers of the Council of the Twelve, under Grandfather Richard's guidance, combined to help me. At the time I prayed fervently to the Lord, saying that if he would help restore me to my feet so that I might care for my children and take my responsibilities, I would serve him willingly for the rest of my life. It was a total commitment which He honored. My recovery was rapid, and since that time I have had many opportunities to work in His church. This experience led to greater solidarity and purpose in our lives. The old chapel where we met in Dayton was sold by the church since the neighborhood was rapidly deteriorating and we were meeting at the Miami Hotel. George was Sunday School Superintendent and I was Relief Society President. Later I became District Relief Society President and Branch Primary President at the same time. A new chapel was built and George supervised its erection while I planned its interior decoration. It was completed during 1950-1952. We were busy and happy, but as Kathryn approached her teens we became aware that there were only a few young people in the church there and began to think seriously of moving to Utah where the children would have more opportunity to associate with young people of their own faith.

"1952-1958 - Salt Lake Years: In July 1952 we bought Alumatic Door and Window Co. in Salt Lake City from George's brother, Ralph, and found ourselves deeply engrossed in a new challenge. The next three years brought steady growth but also excessive business demands. We began to feel that we were neglecting our children. With the hope of lessening the strain we brought others into the company and changed it from a partnership into a corporation - but this didn't work out. After taking some heavy losses we pulled out and formed the George F. Tate & Co. (our present business).

This made it possible for Ralph to assume control of the old business which he had originally started. <span id="page-886"></span>We had built a large rambling brick home in Salt Lake on an acre and a half of creek-side property at 3142 East 3600 South, which we called 'Westate'. We had hoped it would be our home for many years but it was not to be, for we were inspired and guided to bring our children to Provo the year Kathryn was ready to enter BYU. The decision was made, the home we now live in found, and the younger children registered at BY High, all in a single day. It took us several months to sell our East Millcreek home but nevertheless we moved to 688 North 700 East in Provo for registration the fall of 1958. During the Salt Lake years I had worked quite actively as a free-lance interior designer. I also served in church as Highland View Ward Primary President and then as president of the East Millcreek Stake Primary. I also decorated the Highland View chapel and new East Millcreek Stake center.

"1958-1969 - Provo Years: In September of 1958 Kathryn, George and I all registered as Freshmen at BYU. In October of that year I had an offer to travel to Europe to help make decoration suggestions for the Hamburg chapel in Germany, then being supervised by my brother-in-law Burtis F. Robbins, Berlin Mission President. Since I was already committed to commute to Salt Lake twice a week to work with the building committee on the East Millcreek Stake House, and was also registered in school, I was obliged to decline the offer. It had always been my desire that if I ever went to Europe it would be with my husband.

"The intervening years have been very full. Kathryn graduated in nursing, Barbara in speech and hearing therapy, Susan in English, and I received my BA degree in English the spring of 1964 and my Masters in English in 1967. During the summer of 1963 I attended the International Language school at Vienna and then Salzburg, Austria. George joined me for the last part of the summer and together we visited Berlin, Denmark and Sweden, flying home to meet Susan and Barbara in New York, following their tour of the New England states. Our son, George Sheldon, served a West German mission (1964-1966) and upon completion of it met Susan in Luxumburg and they toured Europe together. <span id="page-887"></span>

Kathryn had spent a summer in Mexico earlier (1959) at the language school there and Barbara, not wanting a foreign trip, had gone to the Hill Cumorah Pageant. Upon completion of Susan's BA and my Masters degrees, she received a teaching assistantship in Freshman English and I received a full time contract as an instructor of Humanities at BYU (1967). George Sheldon went back to school following his mission and now plans to complete a PhD in comparative literature with an emphasis in languages. He now is doing advanced studies in Latin, German and Norwegian; to these he will add French, Italian and Greek, in addition to Old Saxon, Gothic and French. He then hopes to teach at BYU. Indeed, we are a school family, busy and happy.

"Now (1969) all three daughters are married and busy raising their families. George Sheldon was just married. George F. has been specializing in genealogy work at BYU in order to become accredited - and he loves it. He is serving as East Provo Stake Mission President. At present I am serving as his companion in this stake mission. Since living in Provo I have also served as Relief Society teacher, counselor in East Provo Stake MIA, and as a decorating consultant on the East Provo Stake Center. The sacred commitment that I made so long ago in Dayton is a life-long promise which I intend always to remember and honor. As a family we look forward with anticipation to many wonderful busy years in worthwhile activities and responsibilities."

## David Christian Christensen 

(50) David Christian Christensen (8) was
born in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah, 16 Nov. 1915.
He grew up in the Gunnison area and attended
school there until his family moved to Manti,
Utah not long after he turned ten years old. Here
he continued his education, graduating from Manti
High School in May 1934, after having acted as
Studentbody President during the year.

Salt Lake City became David's home soon
after his graduation. His father having passed
away in Dec. 1932, David was now the "man of
the family" and his mother's main help in the
things about the place that needed a man's touch.
He was a great help to her. In Salt Lake he registered
at the University of Utah and took some
classes there in the department of Mines and
Engineering for a time. He was somewhat of a
hustler and although the great depression was in
progress in the country he did what he could find
to do to help out.

David was married 17 Dec. 1941 to Myrtle
Osborn (b. 9 July 1917 in Escalante, Utah to
Warren Jasper and Ruby Twitchell Osborn).
Their marriage was solemnized twenty-and-a-
half years later, 21 June 1962, in the Salt Lake
<span id="page-889"></span>
Temple. War preparations were very much in
evidence at the time of their marriage and David,
as well as Myrtle, were soon engaged in the
same, as evidenced by a letter he wrote to his
sister Gladys in San Francisco about a year after
they were wed. A copy of the letter follows:

"Cheyenne, Wyoming
5 Nov. 1942

"Dear Gladys:
Yes, we are more busy now than ever. It
seems like the ships (planes) keep coming in faster
all the time and fewer men to do the work - more
females. It's ten or eleven hours every day so
we do manage to keep out of mischief at home.
We have been lucky to have the same hours the
past two months; hope we can have the same luck,
all winter - and I do mean winter! We sure would
like to live in California by Lake Merrit again.
You don't know how lucky you are not to have to
plow through snow on your way to work. We are
glad and mighty lucky to be together, however,
so in spite of the long hours and Wyoming in
general, we are still in love and happy. And the
money that's rolling in - ah, if living just wasn't
so damn high! By the way, I have had another
raise.

"We had a battle on our hands a few days
ago. It seems they had us on our way to New
York; but me, I turns up the next morning to work
in good old Cheyenne just the same. Well, there
were a lot of promises made to bring us back in
a short time, but I found a fellow who lived in the
east and they sent him instead. It sure did sound
fun but we still want to stay west of Cheyenne,
Wyoming. The draft board hasn't sent any more
news to me and I have my Navy papers all ready
to go if they do. I think I'm safe until February
anyway.

"Myrtle and I are planning to fly home for
Christmas and surprise Mother; that is if we can
both get a couple of days off together. We can
get half fare and that's cheaper than bus - so why
not? It would be swell if you could come too.
Myrtle hasn't even been inside my kind of airplane
yet so I think it will be a swell treat for her.
There isn't much news to tell you from here so I
<span id="page-890"></span>
guess I'll sign off for tonight. Love, Dave &
Myrtle & Dicky. (Dicky is our new little 
boy-bird - lots of fun to play with)."

When World War II was over David and
Myrtle returned to Salt Lake City and joined with
his mother in buying a duplex home there at 1333
South 6th East. Millie lived in the one side until
her death, while David and his family occupied the
other, and still live there. He and Myrtle have
three children, a son and two daughters, the first
daughter born before they returned to Salt Lake
from California where they had been transferred
from Wyoming.

In all, David has worked for United Air Lines
for some twenty-eight years. He worked for them
first in Oakland, Calif. for three months, then two
years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, two years in San
Francisco, and for the past twenty-four years at
the Salt Lake airport. For the past eight years
his wife Myrtle has been working in the delivery
room of the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake as a registered 
nurse. They are still busy, happy people.

## Don Gilmore Christensen 

(51) Don Gilmore Christensen (3) writes:
"I was born 31 Dec. 1916. My mother told me
that there was some discussion as to whether I
was born 31 Dec. 1916 or 1 Jan. 1917, father's 
<span id="page-891"></span>
watch indicating that it was already the New Year
and Dr. Hagen's that it was still 1916. The doctor
prevailed. Whether his watch was more accurate
than father's I do not know; I do know this, however, 
that a birthday sandwiched in between Christmas 
and New Years is not the best time of year
for a young boy's birthday - it tends to get lost in
the other events of the season.

"My oldest brother, Harold, stated many
times that he did not know Mother was expecting
and that it came as a great surprise to him to
learn that he had a new baby brother. He wondered
if the folks had adopted a child. I am twenty-two
years younger than Harold. Mother was nearing
forty-five when I was born. But whether Harold
was expecting me or not, my parents were and all
of my recollections of them are of tender, loving
care towards me. Mother told me several times
while I was a young chap that although she had
other children she felt, upon my birth, like 'Sarah
of Old' must have felt about her son Isaac, who
was born when she was old. She always made me
feel like I was something special and important to
her, and throughout her lifetime I tried to be just
that.

"At the time of my birth we were residing 
within the Gunnison City limits but my first clear
recollection of home is the farmhouse down below
Rocky Point, a mile or so west of Gunnison. Along
about age nine I became ill with pneumonia and 
recall spending considerable time in bed and out 
of school. When I was recuperating, the ice on
the Sanpitch River was thick enough for skating
and sliding. I importuned Mother until she finally
let me go out and play with the others. I was not
sufficiently recovered and the relapse which
followed was considerably more severe than the
initial illness. I have heard that the doctor
despaired of my life, but Mother's constant care
and the 'mustard plasters' apparently pulled me
through. Mother was also my teacher during the
long period of convalescence and I was quite surprised, 
on returning to school, to find that I was
right up with the class.

-"Speaking of illness, there was an evening
<span id="page-892"></span>
and night at the Rocky Point ranch when Keller
Christensen, my nephew, was about as sick as
anyone could get. He had eaten too many green
apples. His brother Cloyd and I had helped him 
but somehow we escaped. Before my ninth year
was over my father became so ill and died. His
death was a severe loss to the family, one that I
did not fully appreciate until much later. I hardly
got to know him except through others.

"Sometime after Father's death we moved
from the Rocky Point home to Fayette, Utah, a
distance of about six miles from Gunnison. We
lived with my Uncle Henry Bartholomew, who
was a widower with young children, The school
house in Fayette had only two rooms and Blaine
Anderson of Mayfield was the principal and teacher
of the upper grades. I started out there in seventh
grade, but somehow convinced Mr. Anderson that
I was as smart as his eighth graders so ended up
graduating with them. It was quite a surprise to
my old classmates in Gunnison to find me a year
ahead of them when I started to attend Gunnison
Valley High School. The years at high school were
interspersed with summers working on the farm
and an occasional trip to the mountains, mostly up
Twelve Mile to the sheep camp or to get out logs
or hunt deer. I rather liked the summers more
than the school time of year, in spite of the heavy
work. I think I might have become a farmer if I
hadn't had so much trouble with hayfever. I
graduated from Gunnison High School in 1934.

"Then it was on to Brigham Young University.
I remember meeting Cousin Phil Christensen there
and being initiated into a club of which he was a
member (Vikings). Undoubtedly I was very much
of a hayseed but Phil was very kind and considerate.
It was in Freshman English class that I first met
Freda. We were both assigned to Miss Black's
class, which was on the hill. Freda's preceding
class was on lower campus and she was always
late for English. Miss Black, who was otherwise
very strict, let her get by with this. Much later
when I teased Freda about this her reply was, 'Well
you'd never have noticed me if I hadn't come in late'.
We did some dating during the next three years, but
<span id="page-893"></span>
nothing too serious. Then I was called to serve in
the East German Mission and she became a most
faithful correspondent during the next 
two-and-a-half years.

"By the time I was released, in Independence,
Missouri, Freda had graduated from the 'Y' as
valedictorian of her class, received a Masters
degree in Chemistry from the University of Chicago,
and was working in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota. Upon my release I made my way in
that direction. She was expecting me but somehow
we got our signals crossed and she didn't meet me
at the station as anticipated. I was very disappointed 
and was not at all sure but that I had
read into her correspondence more than she had
intended. However, having made the trip and
having the address of the apartment where she
and her girl friend were staying, I decided to
look her up anyway. Upon arriving at the apartment 
all my doubts and misgivings were allayed.
I found her in tears. She had missed me at the
station and was sure that I had continued on my
way home and that she wouldn't get to see me.
The recollection of that reception from Freda,
who is not a particularly demonstrative person,
led to our engagement, which occurred later in
Provo.

"But I still had another year of school at the
BYU before graduation, which I completed with a
teaching credential and a major in German. I
went to summer school the following summer and
took French, along with other subjects, with the
intention of going into foreign languages. In the
meantime Freda had accepted my proposal of
marriage and we set the date.

"Freda came to our home in Fayette shortly
before our marriage. To a large extent we were
strangers, for except for our correspondence we
had enjoyed little contact since our school days
together some four years before. I was married
3 Sep. 1941 in the Manti Temple to Freda Seraphine
Decker (b. 14 Dec. 1916 in Snowflake, Arizona to
Louis Addison and Achsah Mae Hatch Decker). At
the same time and place Uncle Henry Bartholomew
married, as his second wife, Freda's older sister,
<span id="page-894"></span>
Catherine. A few days later Freda and I left for
California with the intention of me completing
some graduate work in German at Stanford University. 
This I commenced. I had a scholarship
to that university which helped with my tuition and
Freda went to work for the chemistry department
at the university to pay our living expenses.

"But then came Pearl Harbor and I soon
enlisted and received a commission as an Ensign
in the U.S. Navy Reserve. My first assignment
was at the Naval Air Base at Alameda, Calif. We
lived in Oakland and I commuted on the bus. It 
was while I was stationed here that our first child,
Peter, was born. It was while here also that my
path crossed that of Cousin Sherman Christensen,
who at the time was stationed at Hollister, Calif.

"I was transfered to Eagle Mountain Lake,
Texas and later to Traverse City, Michigan, in
connection with experimental remote control
devices under the air arm of the Navy. I was
assigned as Operations Officer for an air squadron.
My next orders were for Hawaii and so I took Freda
and Peter to her folks in Snowflake, Arizona and
left them there while I continued on with my squadron 
to Barber's Point, some fifteen miles out of
Honolulu. It was while Freda was awaiting my
return from overseas that our second son, Don
Joseph, was born. I stayed in the Honolulu area
until the war was ended and then was in due time
rotated home. It was a happy homecoming.

"When we returned to the area of Palo Alto
in hopes of my starting school there again, we 
found no housing available at our limited means 
although we searched up and down the Bay for 
considerable distance. We finally decided to try
the University of California at Berkeley and were
successful in finding housing in a housing development 
with a lot.of other young marrieds, within
two or three miles of the campus. I soon learned,
however, that there was no course in language
which I needed beginning at that time of year at
Berkeley. But there was a course in law at
Hastings College of Law in San Francisco starting
then; so, more by happenstance than design, I
enrolled at Hastings College and commuted the
<span id="page-895"></span>
first year across Oakland Bay Bridge to San Francisco.
At the end of the first year there I was able
to transfer to Boalt Hall at the University of 
California at Berkeley, where I received my LLB
degree on 17 June 1948.

"During this last school period we had put
the boys in nursery school and Freda went to work
for the Radiation Laboratory on the Berkeley campus. 
Her earnings, together with the benefits
received under the GI Bill, enabled us to get by
quite well. But there was still the bar examination.
This I took early next fall and was successful in
passing. Incidently, I also took and passed the
Utah Bar examination that year but decided not to
return to Utah.

"Upon passing the Bar we learned of an opening 
in the office of John T. Fuller, a practicing
attorney in Porterville, Calif. I accepted his offer
and went into his employ, which later developed
into a partnership that continued until Mr. Fuller's
death in March 1965. In the meantime another
young attorney, George S. Kralowee Jr., who
passed the Bar two years after myself, joined the
firm. We are partners and enjoy a very happy
association. Our new offices at 472 West Putman
in Porterville, when we opened in January 1966,
have room for four attorneys, but neither George
or I desire to take in additional partners at this
time. Neither of my two older sons plan on joining
the legal fraternity. Of the three boys born to us
here in Porterville, Robert, Richard and James
Allen, two have expressed a desire to join me in
the practice of law. However, they are still young
and may change their minds. I haven't been as
fortunate in this respect as Uncle Albert was.
Our one and only girl, Glena, is a very sharp little
student and has pleased her Dad by stating that she
would join me at the office. I replied that she
might make a good secretary - but she too is still
young. Over the years we have built a good practice 
and I am hoping that some of the children will
join me, though I do not intend to do much 'arm
twisting' on the matter.

"When we came to Porterville in 1949 there
was a small branch of the LDS church here, which
<span id="page-896"></span>
was an important factor in persuading us to make
this our home. The church population has grown
steadily and in 1951 we became a Ward in the
Bakersfield Stake. I was sustained as its first
Bishop and served six-and-a-half years. Upon
my release I was appointed to the Bakersfield
Stake High Council under President E. Alan Pettit
and have served in this capacity to the present.
However, my first love is the Porterville Ward
and the members here. I have aiso served as
president of the Tulare County Bar Association.

"I am six feet two inches tall, with blue eyes
and quite grey hair at this writing. I'm sorry to
admit that I'm somewhat overweight at two hundred
and twenty pounds and the weight tends to be 
proportioned toward the middle. Apart from a
persisting hay fever I have enjoyed exceptionally
good health. Right now my favorite hobby is golf,
which I took up some years after coming to Porterville. 
George and I and a couple of buddies usually
make it to the golf course each Saturday, amid
much discussion as to who's going to get how
many 'strokes' spotted to him."

## Charlotte Rose Christensen
<span id="page-897"></span>

(52) Charlotte Rose Christensen (7) writes
something of herself:- "I was born 30 Apr. 1917
in Lyman, Uinta, Wyoming, eighth child in the
family. I attended school at Evanston, Cheyenne
and Lyman, Wyoming, graduating from Lyman
High School as class valedictorian with a scholarship 
to the University of Wyoming at Laramie.

"I spent from Sep. 1934 through June 1937
at the University of Wyoming. I worked my way
through doing stenographic duties and being pianist
of the campus dance band. In July 1937 I accepted
a position with the fiscal agent of the university
but continued in campus activities, including the
dance band, until 23 May 1939. June 1, 1939 I
accepted a summer position with the Department
of Interior at Yellowstone National Park but
stayed summer and winter for two-and-a-half
years. War was declared and I resigned to go to
California, 13 Jan. 1942, at which time I was
secretary to the assistant to the superintendent of
the department at Yellowstone.

"From 27 Mar. 1942 to 8 June 1951 I worked
at secretarial duties with the Air Traffic Control
Division of the Civil Aeronautics Administration
in Santa Monica and Los Angeles, California. My
last position with this group was as secretary to
the Chief of the Air Traffic Control Branch, with
supervision over the stenographic staff. I resigned
due to pregnancy, for in the meantime I had married, 
8 Aug. 1948 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Herbert
James Warne (b. 2 Oct. 1920 in Erie, Pa., to
Earl Ross and Julie Marie Semple Warne).

"He had his own dance band and we had met
through his need for a piano player. He played the
trumpet. He was attending UCLA under the GI bill
at the time and he graduated in Business Administration 
from the University in June of 1950. He
now works for Max Factor as a purchasing agent
and has for the last twelve years and more. His
favorite hobby is his 17 ft. inboard-outboard motor
boat and the fishing and water skiing, etc. it
provides.

"Our three daughters are our greatest blessings 
of all. They are talented in music, dancing,
<span id="page-898"></span>
scholarship, looks and personality - guess you can
tell I'm proud of our children! They are one hundred 
percenters in church attendance, all baptized
LDS of course, and active in church activities.
They hope to bring their father into the church
someday.

"During high school I was secretary in the
Sunday School, Sunday School organist, and Primary
'Blue Bird' teacher. During college days I was
active in the LDS Institute. In our present Westchester 
Ward in California I have been Relief
Society organist from 1959 to the present.

"To me life has always been interesting, with
wonderful experiences. Working in a National Park
winter and summer was a rare opportunity for
observing nature and wild life. The C.A.A. was
another enriching experience, as control of air
traffic is intensely complex and fascinating and I
met many interesting people - my employer, L.
Ponton de Arce, for instance, was one of the men
who originated our system of air traffic control as
we know it today. I also got to see a good-looking
naval officer now and then, named Sherman Christensen, 
a cousin from the office of Commander Max Black.

"My work as a pianist in dance bands since
I was sixteen has given me the chance to meet and
observe countless people during their lighter 
moments - very revealing. I enjoy people and love
to play the piano, so this has been a painless
though demanding way of earning during the years.
My husband and I still play, more as a hobby now,
but the demand always seems to be there,

"I have too many wonderful memories of my
parents to even begin to share them at this time.
Their influence on my life was always for good - I
cultivated my own faults!"

July 1918 in Manti, Sanpete, Utah, in my grandfather 
and grandmother Christensen's home. I
spent most of my first two years on the ranch
(The Oasis) near Lyman, Wyoming or on The
Weber in northeastern Utah where my father ran
sheep. Then Father went to work for Mother's
brother, Uncle Albert, running his ranch west of
Gunnison, Utah. My sister Alta was born at Aunt
Emma's while we were living at the ranch and my
second sister Tresia was born at the ranch and
Aunt Emma took care of little Alta.

"Ivan Lyon's folks were also farming west
of Gunnison for some Mellors. My folks and the
Lyons visited back and forth and played cards
together. The folks would do the chores at night,
on occasions, get out the horse and wagon, spend
the night playing cards and visiting at the Lyons,
while we children slept, then drive home next
morning in time to do the chores. Sometimes the
Lyons would come to our house. People in Gunnison 
used to tell me that the Lyons son, Ivan, once
pushed me into a ditch of water. This was not
quite right however, for Ivan says he remembers
it well because his Dad gave him a licking because
he picked me up and tried to carry me over a
ditch full of water and accidently dropped me in
it. I myself can't remember this since it must
have been before we moved to Goshen when I was
four.

"In Goshen the folks rented a place across
from the George Burraston family, who were fine
neighbors and have been good friends ever since.
Dad finally bought a home across from Uncle Alma
and Aunt Elsie Bartholomew, Mother's sister. 

"The year I was in the third grade we had so
much sickness - measles, mumps, chickenpox,
pneumonia, and I had scarlet fever. Mother said
the doctor came every day for me and my sister
LaFaye, who had measles and then pneumonia.
He expected me to die and her to get well. I don't
remember a thing about getting sick or being sick
until I was nearly well - in fact when I started to
peel. I could pull good sized patches of skin off.
I can also remember the morning LaFaye died,
<span id="page-900"></span>
for she was the one to die while I got well.

"The morning she died Alta and I were awake
and Mother wrapped us in quilts and took us into the
room where she lay. We were still under quarantine
for scarlet fever and the only one who could leave
the place was Dad. He went to work, did our
shopping and all. LaFaye's funeral services were
held on our lawn and they had her casket just inside
the front door. It was cold, since she died 24 Feb.
1927. Mother sat near with us children all around
her while Dad went with the casket to the Goshen
Cemetery. It was a sad, sad time."

George Washington had his story about the
cherry tree and Vera has her own "cherry" 
story:- "Another thing I remember about my illness was
when I regained my appetite. I was starved. I
asked for a dish of cherries one day and I was so
hungry I said I wanted twenty-one cherries. Dad
brought me in a dish of bottled cherries, saying he
had no idea how many there were. But I counted
each cherry as I ate it and there were exactly
twenty-one cherries." Even in little things such
as this her parents demonstrated their love for her.

"Aunt Emma asked me to come to Gunnison
and visit them one summer. In fact, I spent two
or three summers there with Uncle Charles, Aunt
Emma, Ada, Imelda and sometimes Byron. After
Aunt Emma died, and Ada was married and Byron
was on his mission, I not only spent the summer
but the whole winter in Gunnison with Imelda and
Uncle Charles. I took my seventh grade work
there that winter.

"I had just finished sixth grade when our
family moved from Goshen to Santaquin, 1 May 1940.
Dad bought a lot with no house on it. He moved a
big garage from our place in Goshen onto the lot
to make two rooms. We rented a house on the
same block and lived in that while he built our
home. When I came back from my year in Gunnison 
to attend school in Santaquin I was a stranger
but soon got acquainted. I graduated from the
ninth grade after two winters there and then took
the bus to Payson to attend high school, from
where I graduated the spring of 1936. While
<span id="page-901"></span>
attending high school I taught in the Primary in
Santaquin.

"After graduation I picked berries in Provo
one summer and then went to stay with cousin
Elaine in Salt Lake City for about three months
before she moved to Cedar City, since Ted was
already down there working. She lived on 4th Ave.
just around the corner and just below the steps
from Memory Grove. Then I went back to Santaquin 
and worked for Frank Andreason for about
ten months. He lived just across the street north
from the east end of our lot. His wife Lauree had
milk-leg and was pregnant and they had four boys.
I enjoyed working for them. One day Mother came
over and asked me to come and have dinner with
her as she was alone; Dad was working and the
children all in school. It seemed strange to be
invited to my own home for dinner.

"I was married 22 Apr. 1938 in Santaquin,
at the home of our Bishop Karl D. Greenhalgh, to
Ivan Peter Lyons (b. 28 Dec, 1915 in Ephraim,
Utah to Joseph and Karen Allred Lyons). We had
a reception the next night at the Union Hall, mostly
dancing. The day after that we went to Ephraim
to live and here we spent about fourteen years. At
first Ivan worked for Glen Nielson raising turkeys
but later he went to work for the Denver and Rio 
Grande Railroad as a section hand for seven or 
eight years. It was when he was transferred to
Castle Gate and Scenic (a railroad section just
below Soldiers Summit) every winter and had to
board himself that he gave up railroading.

"We rented for the first five or six years in
Ephraim and then bought our own home there. We
spent one summer living in Scenic. I went to
church in Ephraim occasionally but wasn't too
active when the children were young. We moved
to Wendover, Utah some sixteen years ago. Since
coming here Ivan has worked for the potash plant
just east of town, called Bonneville Ltd. - but now
owned by Kaiser Chemicals of Oakland, California.
It is a good job.

"We have had ten children in these thirty
years, losing one in infancy whom we had named
<span id="page-902"></span>
Janet. She was born in Mt. Pleasant LDS Hospital
and died there from the effects of whooping cough.
We buried her in Ephraim the day she was two
months old. I had whooping cough at the same
time, along with my children. Our son Albert,
just older than Janet, was born in Gunnison Valley
Hospital while we were living in Ephraim. I don't
believe the Mt. Pleasant Hospital was finished then.
My sister Loraine was living with us when our
daughter Ann was born (home delivery). Today
we have five children married and ten grandchildren.
Albert has served in the army in Vietnam and
returned home safely, for which we are most
grateful.

"We bought the folks' old home in Santaquin
sometime after Mother's death and I lived there
the winter Ann finished high school, since there
was no high school in Wendover. I then went back
to live in Wendover for the next year and then 
returned to Santaquin for two more winters while
Sharon finished high school there. Ivan came home
about every other weekend during those winters in
Santaquin. However, I only spent a week or two at
a time in Santaquin during the summers, putting up
fruit, etc. In winters there I served as a Relief
Society visiting teacher and also taught in the
Primary. I have always loved to read so I read a
lot there, crocheted, embroidered and sewed a lot
for myself and family. I had to learn to knit to be
able to teach the girls in my Primary class - I also
taught myself to tat.

"I have continued to be a Relief Society
teacher here in Wendover, as well as to teach in
Primary, along with my reading and sewing.
Also, I was assigned to take care of the kitchen on
Relief Society work meeting days. We usually had
potluck but I was required to set the tables and
clean up afterwards, with help from other members."

We are happy to bring Vera's history up to
date with the word that she has now been serving
as Relief Society President in Wendover for about
nine months (since Sep. 1968) and that she and Ivan
went to the Salt Lake Temple, 11 Oct. 1968, to
have their marriage solemnized and four of their
ten children who could qualify sealed to them for
<span id="page-903"></span>

eternity, including the little dead daughter Janet,
for whom Vera's sister Tresia stood. Vera is now
preparing to be sealed to her beloved parents and
hoping that her sister Alta will join her in this
blessing, since they are the only two of the children
yet unsealed to them.

## Margaret Christensen 

(54) Margaret Christensen (2) youngest of the
children in this branch of the family, was born 27
May 1919 in Hinckley, Millard, Utah. Gleanings
from her life's history have been gathered mostly
from her brothers and sisters, although she herself
has contributed a few choice glimpses of her early
years, She writes: "My Papa was one of the
grandest persons I have ever known. He loved us
children but always expected us to be well mannered
and respectful. He could be stern when he had to
be, but he could also be jolly and fun to be with.
During the few short years that I was privileged to
know him he furnished me with some of my most
vivid and cherished memories and most valued
lessons of my childhood.

"'Papa' was the title which Father wished to
be called by his younger children. My friends all
called their fathers 'Daddy' and often teased me
for using such an old fashioned name as 'Papa'.
<span id="page-905"></span>
Like all children I wanted to be just like one of the
crowd and conform, so the next time I saw Father
IT addressed him as 'Daddy'. He was very hurt and
felt that I was being disrespectful. He felt that
this was a slang expression and that was something
he couldn't tolerate, From then on I always called
him Papa and was proud to do so, .

"Father would many times share his dreams
with us younger children as to what was in store 
for us as soon as 'the big deal went through'. One
of these dreams resulted in my learning a very
good lesson. After he had returned from one of
his very frequent trips to Southern California, I
heard Father telling Mother that we would be
moving to California in the very near future. This
seemed to be a culmination of many of my own
dreams and I just had to share it with my friends.
The next morning, in my second grade class, I
stood up and made the startling announcement that
our family would be moving shortly. As a result
a surprise party was planned for me. I was permitted 
to have the party, but along with it came
a stiff punishment for ever having told such a 
preposterous stretch of the truth. As far as I
know Papa was never to know about this - he had
already left on one of his trips. I learned then
that dreams didn't too often or too easily come 
true.

"One spring morning Father announced he 
had decided that Lucile and I were to accompany
him to Southern California. Mother was not too
much in favor of this because it meant our being
taken out of school. Papa had often said that he
felt as much could be learned by traveling to new
places and observing new things as could be
learned in the classroom; so Mother's veto was
soon outvoted by the three of us and we were soon
on our way. How thrilled we were! Just think 
two whole weeks with Papa and no schoolwork or
household chores. We could hardly believe our
good fortune. Father kept us interested and 
amused all the way telling us wonderful stories
and tales of his various adventures. This was
Papa at his best. He loved the out-of-doors and
loved traveling.
<span id="page-906"></span>

"In those days, after leaving St. George,
Utah, the road to California resembled a cow
trail more than it did a highway. We always
crossed the desert at night well supplied with gas
and water. Many times during the night Papa
awakened Lucile and me to help push the car
through the sand that had drifted over the road.
Even this did not dampen our spirits. To us this
was high adventure. During the night we crossed
Dry Lake, a large expanse of dried mud where
one could travel at the break-neck speed of thirty
or forty miles an hour. As we came to the edge of
the desert it was dawn and there was the most
beautiful sunrise. We found a quiet spot under a
stately Joshua tree and Papa cooked a most
delicious breakfast. The memory of the joy of
that morning has never faded. We proceeded to
our destination where we spent a most enjoyable
week in the mountains. From then on traveling
was in my blood!"

Margaret was just short of eleven and a half
years old when her father died. She and Lucile
were the only ones of the children left at home
with their mother at the time. Some time afterwards 
the three of them went to live with the older
daughter of the family, Edythe Robbins, an arrangement 
to benefit both families having been worked
out. Though Lucile did not remain long at the
Robbins' Margaret and her mother did. In fact
this became Margaret's home until she married.

Margaret's schooling was all obtained in Salt
Lake City. She graduated from South Side High
School in 1936. She attended the University of
Utah the winter of 1936/37 and the next fall began
her nurses training at the LDS Hospital, where she
graduated in June 1940 with her R.N. degree, after
which she continued to work at the hospital.

She was married 20 Dec. 1940 in the Salt Lake
Temple to Richard Paul Adams (b. 10 May 1918 in
Salt Lake City to Paul and Florence Eatough Adams).
Paul had attended West Side High School where he
was an outstanding scholar and achieved in sports.
He was in pre-med at the University of Utah at the
time of their marriage and continued on until he
had spent two years and two quarters in pursuit of
<span id="page-907"></span>
his medical education at that school. Margaret
also continued to work as a nurse at the LDS
Hospital after their marriage.

In the fall of 1941 the couple moved to Louisville, 
Kentucky where Paul continued his training
at the Louisville Medical College while Margaret
worked for eight months in surgery at the Norton
Memorial Infirmary and then as supervisor of
surgery in a children's hospital in Louisville.
She became pregnant so discontinued her hospital
work but found employment with the telephone co.
there as operator and night supervisor, which was
much less taxing. She was determined to see her
husband through to his graduation. 

The couple's first child, Richard Paul Jr. (Ricky), was born
in Louisville in January 1944. Margaret took three
months off and then in April went back to work again.
In August she contracted polio. She was immediately 
hospitalized and hot packs were applied
twenty-four hours a day until her recovery was
assured. With the help of medical knowledge and
the fervent prayers of her loved ones she recovered
completely with no ill effects remaining. It was
during this time that Paul graduated from medical
school.

The Adams family returned to Utah and Paul
took his nine months internship at the Thomas Dee
Hospital in Ogden from Sept. 1944 to July 1945.
Margaret worked at the Veterans Hospital in Salt.
Lake from September to January and then moved
to Ogden and worked in the office at the Thomas
Dee Hospital until Paul was finished with his
internship. World War. II was then on and Paul went
from there into the Navy, serving some fourteen
months during which time he was stationed in
Farragut, Idaho, Minneapolis, Minn., San Francisco, 
Calif., and finally Clearfield, Utah.
Margaret went to Salt Lake City to live and it was
here in March 1946 that their second.son, David,
was born, Less than two and a half months after
David's birth his nearly two and a half year old
brother, Ricky, died of leukemia in Salt Lake
City and his body was taken to Provo and buried
beside his grandfather Christensen.
<span id="page-908"></span>

When the war ended Paul took up private
medical practice, first in Manti, Utah for a year
and a half (1946-1947) and then in Delta, Utah for
the years 1947-1950. During that time a baby girl,
Marsha, was born to him and Margaret (July 1947)
in Salt Lake City. A third son, Dennis, came to
bless their home in March 1950 and was also
born in Salt Lake City.

Soon after the Korean War broke out and
Dr. Paul rejoined the Navy. He was assigned
first to Bremmerton and then Pensacola, Florida,
where he took naval air training and graduated as
a Flight Surgeon. In September 1951 he was sent
to the Air Station at Alameda, Calif. and his family
was permitted to join him there. It was there in
December 1951 that the couple's fifth child, Douglas,
was born. From here Paul left for overseas where
he served for eight months on board a carrier in
Korean waters (from Mar. to Nov. 1952).

After some two years in the service Paul
joined his family in California and they settled in
San Lorenzo where Paul set up his own practice
once again. They lived there six years, from Nov.
1952 to Nov. 1958. Then Paul decided to go into
anesthesiology and they moved to Seattle, Washington, 
where he took up his residency at Virginia
Mason Hospital and Clinic from Jan. '59 to Jan.
'61, specializing. He then went with a group of
anesthetists to practice at Eden Hospital in Castro
Valley for a number of months.

In the meantime Margaret worked in Seattle
at the Seneca Summit Hospital in surgery as night
supervisor, while working days at the Medical
Dental Hospital as head nurse. What a busy
woman she was! In Oct, 1961, when Paul was
through with his training in Seattle, he and Margaret 
moved with their young family to Pleasanton,
Calif, and he joined the staff at the Valley Memorial
Hospital in nearby Livermore. Margaret became
employed as supervisor of the surgical floor at
Washington Township Hospital from Apr. '62 until
June '63, She then went to work as office nurse
for a urologist from June '63 until the first part
of '64, when she took a year off from her public
labors.
<span id="page-909"></span>

Margaret returned to work at Washington
Township Hospital as supervisor of both the medical
and orthopedic floors the latter part of '64 until '66.
At present she is employed part time as office nurse
for the urologist for whom she worked before.
She has included church service among her list of
activities over the years. Some of the positions
she has found time to hold, somehow, have been
Primary secretary, YLMIA secretary, Junior
Sunday School Coordinator, Stake Mutual class
leader, Laurel leader, etc.

Since neither nurses or doctors are immune
from sickness or surgery, both Margaret and Paul
have had their "bouts" with these also, especially
in later years. Paul is at present recovering from
one of a series of operations that have plagued him
these last two years. Margaret, the smallest of
the A. B. Christensen children, has had her share
of operations and the like, but her power of "come
back" is unusual. She seems to never stay down
for long but springs right back to good health
again, which she seems to be enjoying at the
present time.

She and Paul are also beginning to enjoy the
fruits of successful parenthood. They get much
joy from the accomplishments of their four living
children who have all excelled in scholarship,
sports and other school activities and church
attainment. They welcomed their son David home
from the Franco-Belgium Mission last year and
have the satisfaction of seeing him back at his
pre-med training at BYU in Provo. They had the
pleasure of attending their daughter Marsha's
graduation in nursing at BYU this June, as well
as the thrill of greeting her first baby and their
first grandchild a few weeks before that graduation.
They have watched with happiness the successes of
their two younger boys as they win their letters in
basketball and football and climb up the ladder of
the Priesthood, round upon round. All these
things help to cancel out the discouragements that
sometimes come along the way.

## Max Albert Christensen 

(55) Max Albert Christensen (8) was born 10
Oct. 1920 in Salina, Sevier, Utah, the only one of
Millie's babies born in a hospital, all the others
being home births. His sister Gladys writes:
"Mother used to say that Max was a perfect baby.
She even entered his picture in the South Sanpete
County Fair one year and sure enough - he came
away with the 'Blue Ribbon'. He attended grade
school in Manti. Max was always very close to 
me. After Father died (when Max was twelve) the
two younger boys missed him terribly. Mother
was so busy making the living, so I always did
what I could to compensate for their loss."

Max as a young boy kept up a steady correspondence 
with Gladys. Excerpts of some of his
letters are included here, all addressed to her in
Salt Lake City: "Manti, 20 Oct. 1932. I got
the pencil box and sure like it. All the kids wish
they had one like it and I don't blame them - do 
you? I am getting along fine in school and like it
much better this year than I ever have. I just
about forgot to tell you how I like the slippers and
thanks very much for them. . . . Dave is glad he
got the briefcase. It is raining here tonight. We
have four railroad men here and it keeps Mama
busy. I wish you could see me in my new suit, it
is brown. I am a Scout now, David has a typewriter 
now. Mama got it of Mr. Beal. I sure like
<span id="page-911"></span>
to write on it and Dave said I could write all I
wanted to. I hope you and Grace don't get married
because you give Dave and me such good presents
and we sure do thank you. Love, Max. . . .
Manti, 13 Feb. 1933. How are you up there? We
are just fine. We had our Boy Scout Buzzerel and
we sure did have fun. The play I was in went over
fine and they had us repeat it in assembly. Mother
is out doing dishes. Grace went back Friday and
we sure miss her. I got your valentine and thanks
a lot - the candy sure was good. We sure have a
lot of snow down here and it sure has been cold -
32&deg; below zero. Our water froze up twice. . . .
I have been taking electricity, making little motors,
buzzers, dot-dash buzzers and other things and
maybe I will get me a small dry cell battery to run
them with. John Nielson is teaching it to me and
I sure like it. Well I've said about all the news so
goodbye. Love, Max. . . . Manti, Apr. 23, 1934
I got your Easter egg and thanks a lot - sure was
good. On Easter, Morlin Cox and I went Eastering
and we sure had fun. I guess you are wondering 
how our marble tournament came out - well it came
out fine! I got first and got a big blue ribbon and it
said on it 'Grand Champion'. I got first in my
room and first in Manti school. We have sure had
cold weather down here but it is getting warmer.
School is only lasting eighteen more days and I
sure hope I get into High School next year. This
is about all the news. Love, Max. P.S. Mother
and I made a good batch of beer - wish you were
here to taste it."

Max, his mother and brother David moved
from Manti to Salt Lake City the spring of 1936. 
His mother had purchased a roomy home at 636
East 3rd South and here Max resided until he
made a home of his own. He attended West High
School from where he graduated. The depression
of the 30's was still on and jobs were hard to find.
After high school he joined the C.C.C.'s for a
time. Then 4 Aug. 1941, in Salt Lake City, Max
married Mildred Fishler (b. 3 Dec. 1918 in Salt
Lake City to Phillip R. and Alice Mabey Fishler).

Then came "Pearl Harbor" and Max joined
the U. S. Navy and by 1 Dec. 1941 was in it up to
<span id="page-912"></span>
his ears. He was a member of the crew of the USS
Enterprise, our country's largest carrier. A
letter from him to Gladys in San Francisco, dated
11 Oct. 1941, read as follows: "My Dear Sister
Gladys:- Yes, time does fly before we realize
where it has gone. I am still well, young and
unhappy, and fighting for the day I will be home
again with all of you. I read your letter and when
I came to the part where you said David had joined
the Naval Reserve it almost, or did bring tears to
my eyes to think he has to come out to all this 'hell'.
It may be glory back home but out here it is just
gruesome, and hatred for everyone and everything.
At first I did want all of them out here fighting 
now I would like to see you all stay where you are
safe. If David is determined to come though, I
hope I get to see him somewhere.

"It has been over a year now since I have
seen any of my family, even Mildred. Home
seems so awfully hard to believe and far away
that sometimes it almost scares me. I hope I am
not ruined when I get home - this is all so terrible.
We lose friends and it just turns one away. I know
what you mean about Mildred. I have always known
it. She is so faithful and everything she does has
a good will behind it. I hope I can get home to
finish school and then our dreams of happiness
will be well on their way. We are doing fine
though in saving - we have a car all paid for and
five or six hundred in the bank.

"Please write me often Gladys and let's get
back in the way we used to. Somehow you always
looked after me and I surely need it now. Keep
praying, not only for me but for all the boys, and
with yours and our Christian prayers I know we
won't go wrong. Your loving brother, Max."

A letter from Max to his brother Wesley and
family in Dividend, Utah was written some weeks
later:- "Nov. 2, 1942 - Hi kids: No, I haven't
forgotten you although I realize it has been some
time since I have written. I am well and we are
still giving them the old 'Enterprise Hell!' I
haven't been made Chief yet, Wes, but I am keeping
my hopes up. I may be a hero one of these days
when I don't get too scared. I hope you are all
<span id="page-913"></span>
keeping the flags waving back home as I sure want
some of that 'Old Glory' pretty soon, also some of
that canned deer meat you have hoarded away. I
hope the kids are both OK and give them my best
love. Please write soon and give me the latest.
Your loving brother, Max."

The folks at home were concerned for him,
Grace wrote to Gladys: "Have been so worried
about Max - still don't know which carrier was
sunk. No news now is good news. My heart
jumps every time I hear the doorbell." And
Millie wrote to Gladys (30 Nov. 1942):- "We've
been so worried about Max. There is still one
aircraft carrier missing but since I got his last
letter I'm sure it's not the Enterprise. Mildred
is taking a month off at Christmas time. Grace
and Doug are taking a trip before gas ration
begins. . . I will send your ration book. We have
had some trouble getting coffee but think we'll
have plenty now as I have some in storage. . . 
Dave and Myrtle will fly home for Christmas. . .
I feel sorry for the Fishlers now they have two
sons and two sons-in-law in the war. . ."

With everyone else in it the temptation to get
into the war proved too great for Max's wife,
Mildred, and she joined the nurses corps. He
objected, but you know how most men are about
their wives. He mentioned this in a letter to
Gladys dated 15 May 1943, from the USS 
Enterprise:- "My Dear Sister Gladys: Just got a letter
from Mildred and she was awfully blue at the way
I feel. I just can't help it - she asked me how I
felt about her joining the service and I told her.
After all this time away I certainly hope I don't
have trouble at home like that, but I certainly
don't like it and she knew it when she went into
the army. In the case that I do get home now and
she has gone overseas, as she said she was going
to do, I am going to be in a fine fix - back to the 
States and no wife.

"I almost forgot to tell you something
important, at least you won't have to go around 
with a gob, as I made Chief the first of 
June - how's that? I took the examination the other day
and sure enough I knew enough to slide by. Don't
<span id="page-914"></span>
tell anyone yet as I'm not absolutely sure of it and
something may go wrong. I don't know how come
I tell you all my secrets first unless that is the
way it has always been - huh? Your ever loving
brother, Max."

Max received his appointment to Chief
Pharmacists Mate and also a well deserved
furlough. A news clipping in a Salt Lake paper
of Aug. 19, 1943 tells something of this:- "To
Chief Pharmacists Mate - Max Christensen, on an
aircraft carrier which has 10 announced battles to
its credit, including the raid on Tokyo and has
received the Presidential citation. Son of Mrs.
Millie A. Gudmundson, 636 East Third South Street,
with whom he is visiting accompanied by his wife,
Lieutenant Mildred Fishler Christensen, stationed
at Camp Fallen, Calif. in the Nurses Corps. They
are also visiting Mrs. Christensen's mother, Mrs.
P. L. Fishler, 679 Second Ave."

The emotional implications of war can be
devastating to people's lives and young blood is
easily brought to the boiling point. Despite Max's
and Mildred's furlough together a rift came between
them and they soon separated, each going his own
way. Mildred re-married and had three sons by
her second husband, Mr. Bleiweis. Max finally
broke under the strain of war abroad and disappointment 
at home and was hospitalized for some time.

There were many who broke under the strain
of World War II, as there are in every war. Max
was one of the lucky ones - perhaps his strong
Viking heritage played a part, as well as the kind
and loving care and understanding of his dear
mother and brothers and sisters. He became well
and strong again and determined to go ahead once
more. There is a "Cinderella" ending to his story,
for on 20 Oct. 1956 in Elko, Nevada he re-married
Mildred Fishler, who was by then divorced from
Mr. Bleiweis. There had never been anyone else
for Max but Mildred.

Max officially adopted the two youngest of
Mildred's three sons and they took the Christensen
name. He is manager of the Rocky Mountain Dental
Supply Company in Salt Lake City and Mildred, a
<span id="page-915"></span>
trained nurse and a good one, takes care of her
brother Dr. Kenneth Fishler's office. He is on the
staff of both the Primary Childrens Hospital and
LDS Hospital in Salt Lake. Living in the 
Twenty-first Ward, both Mildred and Max are very active
in the church. He has served there as Sunday
School Superintendent and in other capacities, as
well as being in charge of Home Teaching. They
sent their son Tony on a mission to the Texas area
from which he returned in January 1967. Cousin
Sherman Christensen was pleased to find that he
had recently moved into the same ward that Max
and Mildred frequent and finds Max to be the same
outgoing, friendly fellow he has always been.

## Alta Clark 

(56) Alta Clark (9) was born 2 Feb. 1921 at
the home of her Uncle and Aunt Charles and Emma
Peterson, who lived on a ranch about one mile east
of Gunnison in Sanpete County, Utah. As long as
her Aunt Emma lived Alta was a favorite of hers.

Alta spent about the first two years of her
life with her family, living in the small farmhouse
on her Uncle Albert's ranch some west of Gunnison,
where her father was ranch foreman. Then they
moved to Goshen, Utah, She says, "I went to
elementary school in Goshen until I was nearing
the end of third grade, 1 May 1930, when we
moved to Santaquin, Utah. Here I finished elementary 
school and Junior High and then went by
bus to Payson for two years of High School. I
never went the last year or graduated, for by that
time I had learned the thrill of earning a little
<span id="page-916"></span>
money of my own. Money was so scarce at home
and we had a big family. Up until this time I had
worked around a little doing odd jobs after school
and Saturdays and picked berries on Provo Bench
(Orem) for Parks in summer and in the beans in
the fall - anywhere to make a little cash.

"Then about 1938/39 I went to Salt Lake City
and got jobs doing housework for various families.
I returned home for awhile during 1942 but later
returned to Salt Lake and continued doing the same
kind of work there until about 1947. Then I started
sewing for a living and went to work for the Hollywood 
Corset Company, making lingerie, etc. I
worked for them for nine years, or until about 1956
when they were forced to close up. Then I got a
job sewing for the Osborn Manufacturing Company
in Salt Lake where they make Pendleton shirts,
coats, etc., and other name-brand clothing of all
kinds. I am still working here at present.

"On 11 June 1955 in Elko, Nevada I married
John Francis Ison (b. 12 Apr. 1921 in Salt Lake
City to Jerry C. and Eliza Robinson Ison). We
met through friends and he was a roofer by trade.
After many years we separated by mutual consent,
although we are not divorced and still see each other
occasionally. I have one son, Terry Thomas, who
has served his turn in the army and is now married
and living in Santaquin. He married a divorcee
with two young children, David and Debbie Rich,
whom he has not yet officially adopted but is raising.

"I love a friendly game of cards. Besides
pinochle, my main hobbies are sewing, hand work
and especially bowling. I belong to the Osborn
Bowling team and in 1965 I won two trophies, one
for my individual high game of 253, at which time
they put my picture in a Salt Lake paper, and the
other a team trophy. I have lived around in
various rented apartments since moving to Salt
Lake City but now rent one part of a duplex at
482 - 4th Ave., where I am very comfortable."

Alta's niece Karen says she is a very "fussy"
housekeeper and a beautiful seamstress. We find
her to have many of her mother's fine characteristics, 
so sweet, loving, pleasant, good natured
<span id="page-917"></span>
and easy to get along with; kind and appreciative
of others and all around good hearted. Alta is
also a fine letter writer. She is rather jovial in
disposition although very, very modest - and
especially shy around strangers. She has a great
love for her brothers and sisters and their families
and stays rather close to those who live near her.
She usually spends Christmas at Tresia's and
arrives there not long after Santa has left, early
Christmas mornings, often waking them up and
bringing bundles of good cheer. Her nieces and
nephews love her. She was especially close to
her sister Lorraine whose recent death was a
great blow to her.

## LaPreal Bartholomew 

(57) LaPreal Bartholomew (5) was born 8.
Feb. 1921 in Goshen, Utah; blessed 1 May 1921
by William K. Thomas; and baptized 20 July 1929
in Goshen Hot Springs by David Poulsen. In her
mother's Book of Remembrance she writes of her
youngest child, LaPreal:- "She was born in a 
four-room adobe farmhouse on the ranch of Robert
Boswell near Goshen, Utah. When five years old
she had whooping cough and at age eight was vaccinated 
for smallpox. She attended the Goshen
public schools through the first four years and
then, since our family moved to Payson in 1931,
she went to fifth grade in Payson where her teacher
was Miss Melba Loveless. She finished the Junior
and Senior High Schools in Payson and then entered
Brigham Young University in the fall of 1939,
majoring in foods and nutrition and receiving her
BS degree in June of 1943."

On 28 Apr. 1944 in San Francisco, Calif.
<span id="page-918"></span>
LaPreal married Gene Francis Loveless (b. 12
Feb. 1920 in Payson, Utah to Owen and Virginia
Harper Loveless). A Payson newspaper later
carried this report:- "The marriage of Miss
LaPreal Bartholomew, daughter of Mr. & Mrs.
A. C. Bartholomew, and Lieutenant Gene F. 
Loveless, son of Mr. & Mrs. Owen Loveless,
was solemnized at the LDS chapel in San Francisco
with. Bishop C. W. Nalder officiating. The double
ring ceremony was used. The bride wore a beautiful, 
aqua-blue afternoon dress with corsage of
gardenias and pink roses. Owen Loveless acted
as best man for his-son. Immediately following
the ceremony a wedding supper was given at the
home of Mrs. Mable Harriman, grandmother of
the bridegroom. Mr. & Mrs. Loveless left for a
short honeymoon trip. They will reside at Chico,
California."

LaPreal writes, "I married Gene F. Loveless
during the height of World War II. This was no surprise 
since we had grown up and gone to school
together in Payson. As a pilot in the airforce he
was later shot down over Germany and died 6 Nov.
1944. His body was brought to Payson where he
was given a military funeral, 12 Nov. 1944. We
had no children and I have not remarried, instead
devoted my time and energy to my profession,
which is in the field of teaching nutrition to both
the public and in schools.

"Having received my BS in nutrition and
education at BYU, I went to New York City and
there received my MS and dietetic training from
Columbia University Teacher's College. Then I
went to California where I received my MPH (the
equivalent of a Doctor's degree in my field) from
the University of California at Berkeley. I went
to Hawaii to teach in the college there where I
arrived by boat 14 Sep. 1953. Thus I have lived
in New York, Hawaii and California, which is now
my home, and loved them all.

"I enjoy travel - seeing new people and places.
My civic services have been in connection with my
work in national and local organizations. I have no
desire to set the world on fire but live a quiet life
with my hobbies, friends and work."

## Cullen Yates Christensen
<span id="page-919"></span>

(58) Cullen Yates Christensen (4) was born
in Manti, Sanpete, Utah 8 May 1921. When he was
a baby he suffered a lot with eczema. His face
was often dobbed up with a soothing, smelly yellow
salve. If he ate eggs he got hives, his tongue
would thicken and his eyes almost swell shut at
times. This was rather disconcerting to Mother
Myrtle, a food specialist and dietition of some
experience, who tried to raise him with the most
scientific care. He was the best-taken-care-of-baby 
one could imagine. He also had a number of
brothers and sisters in the home to help spoil him.

The Christmas Cullen was a year and a half,
I was home from school at Provo for the holidays.
My fiance had given me a ten pound box of chocolates 
and after passing it around a time or two I
placed it in my dresser drawer upstairs for safe
keeping. Every time I went upstairs when Cullen
was awake I would hear the thump- thump- thumping
of his little knees as he came crawling quickly up
the stairs behind me. "Canny, Ninny, canny" he
could barely say it, yet with his baby hands
eagerly extended I knew well what he wanted. And
who could resist? Not I! Together he and I ate a
big share of that whole ten pound box of chocolates
in those ten days. I'm pretty sure Mother Myrtle
had no idea about Cullen's part in it, yet this doubtless 
aggravated his sensitive skin condition.

While he was still in the "diaper stage" his
grandfather Christensen used to take him on short
walks up and down the sidewalk or around the block.
Cullen often wore little black sateen rompers with
a large yellow cloth cat face appliqued on front.
Hand in hand he and grandfather would toddle along,
for the old man's legs were rather short and getting
stiff and he was also built on a rather wide 
track - like the diapered baby. But Cullen's short legs 
grew long in time and the rest of him also grew,
and despite his early digestive problems he turned
out to be the tallest of A. H. Christensen's four
sons.

He was a few months past four when the
family moved to Provo and then later to Orem.
It was in Orem that he attended school through the
grades and high school. He graduated from Lincoln
<span id="page-920"></span>
High School there the spring of 1938 as valedictorian
of his class. He was a talented boy, a fine student
and a great reader. He had a beautiful baritone
voice, was good at basketball; in fact most anything
he put his mind to he could do well. Of course he
had plenty of work to do on the small fruit farm
where the family lived, but he found time to fish
and hunt as a boy - and these he loved to do and
still does to this day.

Cullen writes about those early days in
Orem:- "My most vivid recollections of Dad are
associated with the home in Orem, the fishing and
hunting trips, the family outings, Christmas, and
the law business. I believe Dad really loved that
place in Orem. He always arose early and did a
half day's work before going to the office. I never
could join him in his obvious love for horses and
sheep he kept on the place. Those horses ate constantly 
and I doubt if he ever rode one. He seemed
to enjoy just watching them and perhaps recalling
his early days in Gunnison and Manti.

"My first recollection of fishing was with
Dad at Fish Lake and Strawberry, particularly
Charlie Madsen's camp at Strawberry. I can still
see the smile on Dad's face when he would bring
out a nice native trout on the big pop-gear.

"The Sunday afternoon picnics at Canyon Glen
and Aspen Grove were great. Mother would always
have such good food and Dad did enjoy games with
us children. Of course Christmas Eve when all the
family would gather was the greatest! Each would
perform in turn and Dad would enjoy every minute
of it.

"Mother was always thinking of others and
doing something for someone else. Maybe she got
more enjoyment out of that than doing things for
herself. I truly believe that I was blessed with
the finest parents on earth."

Cullen was popular with the girls at Lincoln
High School but he had found a favorite in Daryl
Stewart, a tall, slender, pretty, dark haired miss.
And Daryl liked Cullen but her mother objected to
her going steady. His parents seemed to be of the
same opinion so the two didn't go steady but they
<span id="page-921"></span>
dated quite often nevertheless. The summer after
high school graduation Cullen went out of state to
work on a ranch. Daryl worked at Parks Cafe in
Orem and found that there were other young men
interested in her, one in particular who was very
persuasive. 

Cullen attended BYU the following winter and
since Daryl seemed unavailable for dating their
paths seldom crossed. The next summer he went
with his brother Phil to Tulsa, Wyoming and worked
for the McGinnis Livestock Company, and Phil tells
something of this:- "I drove my old Austin up to
Wyoming in the summer of 1940 to work for the
livestock company again. As I recall Cullen, my
younger brother, Warren Tanner and Gus Keele
went with me to work on the ranch. Cullen,
Warren and Gus were all pretty good sized and I,
of course, had then reached a pretty mature stature
myself, although I think I was smaller than the
others. When we finished our work on the ranch
that fall we went up to Yellowstone Park. We had
no place to stay and we spent one of the coldest
nights I ever recall, all four of us trying to sleep
in that little old Austin. But we had a nice trip
nevertheless. I don't remember how much money
we were able to save from the work up there but
it was not a great deal, though it did help a little
getting started in school again."

Cullen attended BYU that winter. Daryl married 
Richard Hamilton Sparks that same
winter. After his two years at BYU Cullen went
back to Washington D.C. and studied law at the
George Washington University. To make his way
he was also employed by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in its Washington office. Here he
remained from the fall of 1941 until Aug. 1944,
when he was drafted inte the army, since World
War II was on. He trained first in Texas and then
Maryland and became a special agent in the U.S.
Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). He was
sent to serve in Japan but arrived there just as
the war ended in 1945. However, he remained
in Japan with the forces of occupation until 1946.

Meanwhile, Daryl was having marital problems 
and was in the process of securing a separation
<span id="page-922"></span>
from her husband. One day she ran across Cullen's
sister Norma on the street and, stopping to inquire
about Cullen, learned that he was on his way home,
she said casually, "Tell him to look me up when he
comes - I'd love to see him." And look her up he
did and their friendship of high school days was
soon renewed.

Cullen and Daryl Aldene Stewart (Sparks)
were married 23 Oct. 1946 at her parents' home
in Provo. Cullen's father performed the ceremony 
in the presence of members of the two
families. Cullen comments on this:- "The only
time I can ever recall Dad being flustered was
when he was performing the marriage ceremony
for Daryl and me. He kept getting his notes
turned upside down. What a precious moment to
remember!" A wedding dinner was given later in
honor of the bride and groom at a party house in
Orem, with members of both families present.
Daryl was an only child, having been born 16 Oct.
1921 in Salt Lake City, Utah to Allen Glover and
Martha Ellison Stewart. She had two sons by her
first husband: Richard, almost five at the time of
this second marriage, and Robert, two and a half.
Cullen adopted these two boys soon after and they
took the Christensen name.

Immediately after their marriage the couple
left for Washington D. C. where Cullen resumed
his study of law at George Washington University
as well as his position in the office of the F.B.I.
It was arranged that after they were duly settled
there, his sister Norma would fly back with the
two little boys. And this Norma did - and she tells
about it:- "A most promising opportunity appeared
on the horizon when Cullen and Daryl accepted my
offer to fly back to Washington D. C. with their
two boys. I planned to work for a while in the
nation's capitol, at least until my sweetheart,
Reed, was out of the army and we could make
more realistic plans for the future. For a final
outing of skiing prior to my leaving, I borrowed
some ill-fitting boots which literally became my
downfall. On an innocent-appearing slope my
inside runner dug in and I found myself cartwheeling 
into a snowy heap, my right leg twisted
<span id="page-923"></span>
into an odd and painful position. . . Later, with a
walker heel attached to my cast, I was able to walk.

"Our flight to Washington was a chore, to
put it mildly, beginning at 2:30 a.m, 18 Feb. 1947.
However, the most difficult part came after we
arrived, In my 'unhandy' condition we were the
last ones off the plane, thereby missing Cullen's
page for us over the loud speaker. Having received
no response, Cullen and Daryl checked the time of
arrival of the next flight and spent the interval
gaily window shopping, having lunch, etc. Meanwhile, 
back at the terminal we were experiencing
almost complete despair. My efforts to make contact 
by phone were of course fruitless and the boys
were so tired from our almost sleepless night that
they were completely unmanageable. Finally, after
what seemed like an eternity and to my indescribable
relief, the parents of my charges appeared.
Whew! That was my somewhat unpleasant introduction 
to five fabulous months in Washington D.C.,
the first four weeks of which were spent housebound
with my newest sister-in-law, because of my cast.
But this provided us an opportunity to get acquainted
and in no time at all I became convinced that my
brother Cullen was the luckiest man I knew."

Cullen graduated from George Washington
University Law School with an LLB degree in 1948
and the family returned to Provo, Utah. He was
admitted to the Utah State Bar in 1949 and joined
his father and two older brothers in their law firm
there. He has been a practicing attorney since
that time to the present in Provo, with the exception 
of a period (1951-52) spent again as special
agent, U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps,
during the Korean War.

Daryl and Cullen eventually built a beautiful
home on Canyon Road in North Provo where they 
reside. They both find time to play golf and Cullen
to go fishing and hunting. Attending conventions
all over the country is also a part of their life
together, for Cullen has served as president of
a number of local civic clubs and organizations
as well as president of the Utah State Bar. He
sought his first political office in this last presidential 
election (1968) when he ran as a candidate
<span id="page-924"></span>
for Judge of the Fourth Judicial District - but he
was defeated. Among a few of the credentials
listed on his campaign literature were 
these: - "Current President of Utah State Bar Association;
Utah County Bar Association (past president);
American Bar Association; American College of
Probate Counsel (Utah State Chairman); Provo
Rotary Club (past president); Past President Provo
Jaycees; Provo Chamber of Commerce (Past
Director); Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks,
Provo; Utah Valley Opera Association (Past
Director); Past President of Riverside Country
Club; Member of LDS Church."

Fundamentally, the processes of the law
mean a great deal to Cullen and he came by this
naturally, since it was sorta "born and bred in
him" as it were. I remember hearing of the time
when he was taking his first turns at driving the
family car. He was driving Father home from
Salt Lake City late one night. They were alone
and Father was in the back seat, presumably
asleep. Cullen began speeding and the siren of an
alert highway patrolman made him well aware of
it. He pulled off the highway and slowed to a stop
and the patrolman was soon questioning him rather
bruskly. Cullen squirmed under his gaze and
glanced hopefully in Father's direction but the
older man never moved or spoke. Cullen was on
his own with his accuser and Father allowed him
to suffer the full impact of breaking the law.

Yes, Cullen learned first hand to respect the
law by counsel and example, for his father believed
in and lived it to the fullest. Cullen writes of him
in this regard:- "While my association with Dad
at the office was not nearly long enough, I know
he was a great lawyer. Older members of the
Bar still comment on his integrity and hard work.
The law was really his life. Perhaps so much so
that in his declining years he was unable to find
real interest in anything else. Near the end, I can
still see him sitting at his desk, moving papers
around, and acting like an old war horse who would
like to do battle just one more time."

## Tresia Clark

(59) Tresia Clark (9} was born 28 May 1922
in Gunnison, Sanpete, Utah. Her birth took place
on her uncle Albert Christensen's ranch a mile or
so west of town in the small farmhouse there,
since her father was then serving as foreman on
the ranch.

Tresia writes about herself:- "A few months
after my birth in Gunnison our family moved to
Goshen, Utah to live. It was here I started school
when I became of age. In early spring of my
second year of school we moved to Santaquin, Utah
where Father had bought a lot of the southwest
corner of a block there and at first we rented a
house on the southeast corner of that same block
until Dad had enough of our house finished on our
new lot to move in. Here we only had lanterns to
see by at nights for some weeks and I remember
how wonderful it seemed when we got electricity
into the house. I also remember spending hours
and hours moving rocks from the ground before
Dad could plant our garden. 

"I finished the ninth grade of school in
Santaquin and then started high school in Payson,
traveling back and forth by school bus. But I
dropped out of school before Christmas of that
year. I remember Uncle Albert Christensen took
me over to his home in Orem during the Christmas
vacation and talked to me about how important an
education was. At the time I half promised to
return to school the beginning of the new year an
but I never did.

"On Easter Sunday, the next spring, my
oldest sister, Vera, was married (1938). I was
<span id="page-926"></span>
with a group of young friends in a car when we had
a terrible accident. A drunk, driving another car,
ran into us. My sister Alta was among those in the
back seat but was not seriously injured, as some
of the others of us were. I was sitting in the front
seat and was badly injured and not expected to live
for about a week. My face was cut almost from
ear to ear and other damage. I was unconscious
for quite a period. When I first saw my father,
after regaining consciousness, I told him that I
was concerned that he and Mother had not been to
the Temple to be sealed for eternity. This seemed
to have been constantly on my mind after the accident.
I recalled Mother worrying about my sisters
Vera and Alta turning eighteen before she and Dad
got around to having us children sealed to them. I
exacted a promise from Dad at that time that he
would prepare to have his and Mother's temple
work done before my eighteenth birthday.

"My parents did prepare themselves and
were permitted to go to the House of the Lord in
Manti and have their temple work done and us
younger children sealed to them the very day before
my eighteenth birthday, 27 Mar. 1940. I know how
happy they will be when all of their children are 
sealed to them and we can all look forward to being
together in the world where they have gone. They
made many sacrifices for us; the least we can do 
now for them is to prepare ourselves by righteous
living to join them as a family in the eternity.

"In 1940 I started a course under Margaret.
P. Maw at the Provo School of Beauty Culture and
graduated from there 15 Dec. 1941. I worked for
a year as a beautician in Fillmore, Utah and then
for a time in Helper, Utah. I also did the same
kind of work in Murray, Utah after my marriage.
I later went to Salt Lake City and worked in a war
plant (radio tube plant).

"It was while working in Salt Lake City that
I met my future husband, Max Andrew Rosenlund
(b. 20 Mar. 1926 in Fairview, Utah to Paul Andrew
and Annie Darthea Peterson Rosenlund).

"Max and I first met in February of 1945 and
were married the following October 23rd in
<span id="page-927"></span>
Evanston, Wyoming, where my parents had been
married, We lived in Murray, Utah for a number
of years and then bought our present home at 6871
Springbrook Way in Salt Lake City. We have had
two sons and three daughters and are so grateful
for each of them. We also had my sister Alta's
son Terry in our home for several years until he
went into the service. Max and I went through the
Salt Lake Temple and had our five children sealed
to us, 10 Dec. 1960.

"I started working at the Mode O'Day factory
in 1944 and am working there at the present time.
I have worked off and on all during my married life.
My husband Max and our eldest son, Wayne, and I
have gone into the part-time business of upholstering 
and we are doing quite well. We recently built
the booths for the Oakridge Country Club. Max
built the booths, Wayne did the upholstering and I
did the sewing. It was a beautiful job, if I do say
so, and we have had a number of calls from other
interested parties and have a couple of jobs to bid
on now. My favorite hobby, besides my family
and the church, is sewing. At present we are 
repainting and refurnishing our home and I have
been making new bedroom drapes and also new
ones for the kitchen.

"I have been a Sunday School teacher for the
past eight or nine years. We now live in the 
Butler 5th Ward, Butler Stake. I am veryanxious
to get started on my genealogy. I don't know the
first thing about this work but I'm determined to
learn. Our oldest daughter Karen attended BYU
at Provo this past school year and took classes in
this subject. She too is interested in genealogy
and perhaps together we can do something about
our own. My main desire in life is to stay close
to the church, live by its teachings, and raise |
righteous children."

## Marjorie Christensen 

(60) Marjorie Christensen (7) was born 6 Aug.
1922 in Evanston, Wyoming. It was in Lyman,
Wyoming, however, where she spent most of her
early life. It was here that she was baptized a
member of the LDS church; here that she later
taught in the Primary organization and where she
acted as Sunday School Organist. 

It was in Lyman also that she attended school.
While at Lyman High School, from which she later
graduated, she took typing, among other subjects,
and became very efficient in it. In tests she established 
what was said to be a world's record of 120
words per minute on a manual typewriter. She
went to Provo, Utah to compete with other students
from several states. During the first part of this
test she found she had typed some with her fingers
on the wrong keys so she quit typing. She probably
could have won if she had started the test all over
again since the winner made only 60 words per
minute.

Like her older sisters Marjorie not only
became a fine typist but an excellent pianist and
singer as well. In 1940 she and her sister Alice
<span id="page-929"></span>
went to Ogden, Utah and lived for a time with their
married sister LaFaun (then Slagowski). Here
they obtained a spot on KLO Radio singing duets
daily under the label 'Alice & Marj" - and they
were very well liked. Then Alice received an
offer as a full time piano player in Ely, Nevada,
so Marjorie went there with her.

It was in Ely that Marjorie met her future
husband, Mart Eugene Strouse (b. 27 Feb. 1920
in Malad, Idaho to John Lawrence and Amelia
Goddard Strouse). The two went to Evanston,
Wyoming to be married, 14 Mar. 1941, with both
of their fathers and mothers being present at the
civil ceremony. The couple settled first in Ruth,
Nevada but later moved to what was known as
"New" Ruth, Nevada. Here the husband "Gene"
became a supervisor at Kennecott Copper mine
and has been such for many years. They had two
children, a boy and a girl.

As is sometimes the case, heartaches come
with raising a family. Their son Eugene died on
the school grounds at "Old" Ruth, Nevada at age
thirteen, supposedly of a heart attack. Their
daughter, who married a cameraman at a TV
studio in Los Angeles, was disappointed in her
marriage and returned to her parents' home before
the birth of her first child. She later married
happily, however.

Marjorie, tall, slender, talented, and with a
sweet personality and happy disposition, welcomed
her parents into her home about a year before the
death of her mother. In fact it was in her home in
Ruth, Nevada that her mother passed away, Nov.
1952. She remembers as a youngster in Lyman,
Wyoming her father chording on the guitar and
singing. "Father had the best bass voice I ever
heard. He sang solos in church and at church
parties and always wished that he had received
more special vocal training."

Marjorie worked on a few occasions after
her marriage. When her daughter, Barbara, was
in eighth or ninth grade she worked for a year at
nearby Ely, typing and selling sheet music and
records in a music store. Her last job was typing
<span id="page-930"></span>
for the Red Cross in Ruth for a year or two. But
mostly she has concentrated her time and energy
in being "just a housewife".

In late autumn of 1967 in her home in Ruth,
Nevada she was accidently shot in the face. She
says she remembers nothing about the incident
until she came to in the hospital. This has 
necessitated a number of subsequent trips to the LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City for plastic surgery and
will perhaps mean others later. We wonder at
times why trouble such as this should happen to
so sweet a person. We do not know the answer.
Only an all-seeing Providence knows the whys and
wherefores of such things. Yet we know that
trouble and sorrow have a place in our earthly 
lives and that such experiences must somehow be
schoolings to give wisdom and strength and that
rich blessings will follow if we learn the needed
lessons - like a glorious rainbow ofttimes follows
a furious storm.

## Mabel Norma Christensen

(61) Mabel Norma Christensen (4) writes her
own history:- "I was ushered into this world, I'm
told, in the midst of a rain and wind storm on the
morning of Friday 13 Apr. 1923, in the family
home at Manti, Sanpete, Utah, the seventh child
<span id="page-931"></span>
of my father and the second of my mother. I have
few recollections of living in Manti however, since
we moved to Provo when I was nearing two-and-a-half. 
Less than a year later we moved to Orem,
Utah and lived on an 83 acre farm which became
home to me during the rest of my growing-up years.

"Climbing up the steep, dark basement steps
on my first visit to that home in Orem still clings
to my memory. Other features that were to
influence our daily lives were the outdoor toilet a
considerable distance from the house down by the
chicken coops; the water pump just a few feet from
the back porch from which all our culinary water
was obtained, and damp cloths over perishable
food placed in the open kitchen window as a means
of refrigeration. But despite what seems to be
primitive conditions to us today, I remember no
feelings of frustration for lack of conveniences,
except when the roosters would chase me on my
desperate dash to what I called the 'lugly tote'.

"My sister Kathryn's arrival was a joyous
occasion, but during mother's stay in the hospital
the news arrived that her sister Ida had been killed.
Her home was right across the street from ours in
Manti. The fall after Kathryn's birth I started
school at the Spencer Elementary, thoroughly
primed by both Father and Mother as to the
importance of an education. Though I didn't
always feel the need of bringing home a straight
'A' report card, yet I can never remember being
flippant about the grades I received.

"As the middle of my second grade year
came it was suggested to my parents that I, along
with three others, be promoted to third grade then
and there. In spite of brother Phil's special trip
home from the U of U to try and prevent this, (he
knew of what he spoke, having had three special 
promotions himself) I found myself in the world 
of third graders. But often the emotional maturity
of a child is not sufficient to cope with such social
changes, and looking back I find that I was a prime
example. It seems I was always at odds with my
friends and ended up playing with youngsters
either younger or older,
<span id="page-932"></span>

"School work I usually enjoyed and seldom
encountered much difficulty with it, except when
it came to creative writing. An experience that
happened in Mr. Cordner's seventh grade English
class provided me with the greatest object lesson
in honesty that I can remember. We had each
been assigned to write a story, the best of which
was to receive a prize. I made several attempts
but each one ended in complete failure. Finally in
desperation I solicited Mother's help on the last
night before the assignment was due. She agreed
to help me but as the hour drew late, sent me off
to bed, promising to assist me next morning. I
awakened to find a very sweet story she had written
available for me to copy. But time was short and
the story long so I handed it in in Mother's handwriting. 
I really was feeling shabby about the
whole thing when I was called up front to receive
a fine Eversharp pencil for winning the story
contest. I was appalled - and literally hated the
sight of that pencil, and managed to lose it as soon
as possible.

"That summer Father bought a house trailer
and he and Mother, Cullen, Kathryn and I set out
on a trek across the country. First we visited
Mother's brother, Uncle Yates Farnsworth and
family in California where the ocean breezes gave
me such a stiff neck it was painful to move for
weeks. But there we had a most delightful introduction 
to ocean swimming, sunbathing - and to
10&cent; malts. I also acquired a gorgeous sunburn
and went 'peeling' across the country. From
California we journeyed the southern route to
Washington D. C. to meet Phil, who was there
attending school and working. From here we went
to New York, Chicago, and home. We visited
twenty-four states, Canada and Mexico. Cullen
was just learning to drive and spent many hours at
the wheel in utter joy. One of the most remarkable
things about that trip was that we children hardly
quarreled at all.

"I have some definite impressions of our
family life during my growing up years. First of
all there was no doubt in any of our minds as to
who was the head of the family. We all recognized
<span id="page-933"></span>
in Father a man of impeccable honesty and moral
character, a person of great determination and
courage. He was a man whose decisions we
learned not to question, whose stern rebukes
were more effective than a physical whipping
from Mother or anyone else. But we also knew
him as a man capable of a deep love and concern
for his family, one who had endured heartbreak
and sorrow in the loss of his first wife and a son,
one who had weathered crippling financial disasters
but who could still hold his head high in the knowledge 
that his word was his bond and that with the
gift of life came the obligation to live it to the
fullest. 

"I have always felt that mine was a strict
moral upbringing rather than a religious one.
Though we children attended church as the thing
to do, Father's Sundays were spent working at
the office, and Mother's to a large extent at home
trying to catch up on her endless duties while we
children were away. As my studies became more
demanding I found Father's office an excellent
place to work and my attendance at church became
less and less frequent. But as my church association 
decreased I seemed to replace it to an extent
with a very happy association with Father. In
addition to many Sunday trips to the office, I was
often permitted to accompany him on short business
trips throughout the state. His love for life, of the
law, his strong political beliefs, his curiosity concerning 
the world about him, his love of and pride
in his family - all these I felt honored to share; and
through this close association I came to know that
I could never dishonor this great man and continue
to live with my conscience.

"Growing up on a farm in a fruit raising community
provided plenty of opportunity for hard
physical work, and that became very much a part
of my summer routine, Many were the days I
spent in our strawberry patch from dawn until
evening, or packing cherries or sorting peaches; 
and many were the nights I can remember that 
Mother's head never touched the pillow, but in
the morning tables and counters of jars filled with
freshly canned fruit were ample testimony to her
<span id="page-934"></span>
previous day's and night's activities. These were
the depression years.

"Not long after brother Hale's death I remember 
bathroom and kitchen facilities being installed
in our house along with a wonderful fireplace; but
several years passed before we enjoyed the luxury
of a refrigerator. Asking Father for money was a
painful experience for both of us, especially if it
was for something he considered a 'frivolity'. So
by the time I was in high school I managed to earn
enough money to buy most of my own clothes.
However, if we needed money for something Father
considered worthwhile, such as furthering our
education or developing our talents, the money was
made available somehow. Many a dollar went down
the drain in a vain effort to teach me how to play
the piano. But needless to say, my regrets were
great and the pangs particularly sharp on occasions
such as our family Christmas parties when everyone
was supposed to perform.

"In the spring of 1940 I graduated from Lincoln
High School, having just turned seventeen. As
Cullen had done the year previous, I delivered the
valedictorian address. To my delight I got a job
in the booth selling tickets, etc., for SCERA 
swimming pool at 12&frac12; cents per hour and I felt that my
days as 'official berry picker' were over. Not
that they hadn't been good days, for I remember
dashing home from the berry patch or whatever,
getting cleaned up and dashing off to play ball until
dark, after which I would either spend my night at
the ticket office for the SCERA theatre or enjoy the
current movie. Our ball team was terrific and we
were Sharon Stake champions for a number of years.

"Boys had definitely become an item in my
life by this time but the only fly in the ointment was
curing them of their fear of Father. On this particular 
subject he and I had great difficulty. I got
some comfort out of my sister Elaine's tales on the
same subject. Father later very aptly described
his attitude toward his daughters' boy friends when
he said that he had chosen to adopt the English
approach to the law in this situation by assuming
them to be guilty until proven innocent. Needless
to say, many young man's enthusiasm cooled under
<span id="page-935"></span>
this icy treatment and even those who survived
that ordeal never felt quite at ease in our home.
This was a situation I vowed I would ease if I
ever had a home of my own.

"I experienced a rude awakening in my transition 
from a 'mighty high school senior' in a small
town to a lowly freshman at BYU. The summer
after my freshman year Father, Elaine and I
accompanied my future sister-in-law, Gwen, to
New Orleans, where she and Phil were married.
That trip was really a lark. Even my knocking a
cow over on a lonely Louisiana highway didn't
dampen our spirits much, since poor Bossy was
able to struggle to her feet again and merely gave
us a resentful stare. Elaine's keepsakes to take
back to her children were hilarious. I still
remember her lowering a bottle on a string down
into the Mississippi River for some real muddy
Mississippi water and her chipping off some stone
from a tomb to show and tell. .

"The Pearl Harbor attack the next December
started many decided changes in our lives. Both
Phil and Cullen were frozen to their jobs with the
F.B.I, and the following summer I started working
for the military at Fort Douglas. I loved my newfound 
independence, I had never been happier.
Every day was a new adventure. Sometime during
that period I received my patriarchal blessing in
which I was counseled to return to school and
finish my education. So when Father also started
urging my return I agreed to enroll spring quarter,
1943. It was hard to settle down to studying at BYU
again and I missed my friends and activities in Salt
Lake City. In answer to my pleas to return to the
University of Utah the next fall, Father agreed on
condition that I help him in the office that summer,
since he had lost his good secretary and was in
desperate need. That was a bargain! 

"Poor Dad! My stenographic training consisted 
of three quarters of shorthand and one of
typing. But his patience was endless, and working
with him that summer was truly a wonderful experience. 
I came to love and enjoy him as a real
friend as well as a father. I began to see what a
great man he really was. I couldn't believe his
<span id="page-936"></span>
capacity for work! Alone, with only a second-rate
typist to assist, he managed to serve innumerable
clients, with his main object being primarily to
hold the law firm together until his partner sons
could return and share the load - and the business.
At the age of 72 he was putting in enough hours for
two men. That summer became a very precious
memory to me, and surprisingly provided me with
enough legal stenographic training to bluff my way
later into two excellent jobs - one in the legal
division of the State Tax Commission and the other
as secretary to the Legal Counselor for the Public
Works Committee of the United States Senate in
Washington D. C.

"When I enrolled at the University of Utah
that fall it was like going home. I rented a room
at the home of my speech teacher, Mary J.
Webster, 222 South 13th East. Living at the
Websters' was absolutely ideal. School was but a
block away, kitchen privileges were available, the
rooms were pleasant, and the Websters were the
kindest and most considerate people alive. They
had rented their rooms in the absence of three sons
who were in the armed forces. Their oldest, John,
had been missing since the previous February and
was presumed dead. Ted was serving in Africa
and Italy. Their youngest son, Reed, was on the
front in Germany. These worried parents seemed
to greatly appreciate our company in their loneliness 
and literally made their home our home. With
the exception of six weeks, this truly was my home
for the next two-and-a-half years.

"In the middle of April of my Senior year, word
was received that the youngest Webster boy had been
wounded in action, and on May 8th the war ended in
Europe. I passed my comprehensive examination,
gave my oral recital on Ernie Pyle, graduated with
high honors, and came to worship my old, fat history 
professor, Dr. Creer. I would gladly have
been his slave but instead, he hired me to correct
papers and do stenographic work for which I received
a modest wage. Graduation found me more eager
than ever to remain in school; so, with a part time
job in the History Department, I signed up for six
weeks of summer school as a start on a Master's
<span id="page-937"></span>
degree in History.

"Toward the end of June I returned to my
room one day to discover that the Webster Charm
School (as we called the upstairs area, occupied
solely by girls and long forbidden to the opposite
sex) had been invaded by a boy - a man - well a
male! There he was, busily vacuuming the floor
of the east bedroom with one hand, the other in a
cast from the tips of the fingers to the shoulder,
I had caught my first glimpse of Reed Webster, in
the flesh that is since I had often seen the picture
of him and his girl friend from Buffalo that stood
on the piano in the Webster living room. There 
may be no such thing as 'love at first sight' but
let me attest to the fact that there can be instant
attraction. I thought he looked very interesting
and extremely heroic in that cast. But then I |
quickly jarred myself back to the reality that he 
was taken and that I had been asked to vacate my
room in August so that the young lady from Buffalo
could come and visit.

"Reed was temporarily stationed at Bushnell
General Hospital for the first few of many operations 
necessary to regain maximum use of his
badly shattered right hand and arm. During the
next few weeks his periodic appearance on the.
scene set in motion an absolute flurry of fun and 
excitement; picnics, canyon parties, beach parties
and house parties were continually in progress,
and I was often included as Reed's partner. Now
the lower reaches of the Webster house, affectionately
called the 'Ratskeller', rocked with the rumble of
masculine voices and laughter.

"It was with real regret that I headed back to
Orem the first of August. The next two months
was a period of frustration for me. The latter
part of September came at last and I returned to
Salt Lake most gratefully. Upon entering the
familiar Webster front room, I was struck by the
absence of a certain picture. It was with real
interest that I learned from my roomies that the
young lady's visit had only served to convince Reed
that his former army interests really didn't fit
into his home environment. He and the girl from
Buffalo had completely severed their connections.
<span id="page-938"></span>
Why was Iso pleased? After all, I was only one
among many of his feminine admirers, as evidenced
by the numerous phone calls and visits from members
of my sex who were definitely not relatives.

"Though I registered again for graduate work
my enthusiasm for further scholastic pursuits
dwindled. So I took 'incompletes' in my classes
and joined the ranks of the employed. It was fun
to have my evenings free for fun. I got a job in the
president's office at the U of U. Every girl should
have the experience of living with a group of girls
such as I did, and a whole book could be written of
the times we had - and in fact one was started by
two of the girls and appropriately titled 'I Speak
For the Bathtub'.

"Meanwhile, my attraction to young Webster
was completely frustrating to me. In his presence
I felt stupid and speechless, and I knew he considered
me an easy conquest. I was too handy for
him. More often than not his 'dates' consisted of
a call up the stairway with an invitation to leave
shortly for a hastily arranged beach or canyon
party. But when I discovered that the girl he took
to formal parties was not me, but one of his 
over-eager sorority friends, I plotted by revenge. He
would be cut off my list, and the next time he
issued his last-minute invitation I'd tell him to
go sit in the sand.

"The chill from upstairs no doubt drifted
down to the lower levels, for Reed began to send
out 'peace feelers'. Soon my wounded pride was
soothed and my self respect restored - I was ready
to continue this game of cat and mouse with this
Webster 'playboy'. By no means did either of us
entertain the idea of going steady. On every furlough 
he continued to cut a mighty swath among the
local damsels while I managed to provide him with
sufficient competition with an ever-increasing number 
of young men - most of them recently returned
from the service.

"The spring of 1946 Reed completely erased
my former resentments of his ways of dating me
by inviting me to the Military Ball at the University
of Utah. It had been years since I had attended a
<span id="page-939"></span>
formal dance - I was so thrilled! By then I was
serving as secretary to Colonel Black in the ROTC.
I went shopping for the prettiest gown in town - and
I found it! It was the most glamorous thing I had
ever seen - a gorgeous, off-white creation of
Grecian design, which made me feel as elegant as
a queen. The amount in my purse was less than
half enough to buy it but that dress simply had to
be mine!

"Somehow the money was found, And as I
descended the stairway on the big night, the look
in Reed's eyes told me that the gown was worth
every penny - every 7,500 of them in fact! Following 
a most perfect premiere (the fact that an exact
duplicate appeared on the wife of one of the commanding 
officers failed to dampen its happy
influence) that little dress was worn many, many
times by me, by all of my tall roommates, by my
lovely niece, Donna Southwick, when she was
crowned Days of '47 Queen, and even by my gorgeous 
sister-in-law Daryl. It was one formal
dress that literally wore out, and because of the
pleasure and service it brought to so many it
became one of my most worthwhile investments."

When Reed went away for his various operations 
he never corresponded with Norma, which
left her in doubt of the sincerity of his interest in
her and turned her thoughts and consideration to
other available young men. There was among
them a tall, handsome airforce Captain and
former all-American basketball player from West
Point, named "Suitcase" Simpson, and there was
Harry, a studious medical student whose sterling
qualities were beyond reproach. Simpson, however, 
was killed in an airplane crash while
attempting a landing at Washington D. C. before
he could continue his courtship. But Harry proposed 
and Norma begged for time to consider. As
she came home from that proposal, Reed met her
and, fully aware of his competition, asked her to
go for a ride with him.

Norma writes of this:- "I could think of no
means of escape. A short distance from the spot
where Harry had proposed not more than an hour
before, Reed parked and, in the sweetest and for
<span id="page-940"></span>
him unbelievable humility, begged that I give him
a chance to prove his worthiness of me. Gone was
the arrogant, devil-may-care attitude, the fast
talk, the wise cracks, the big time show. There
before me, stripped entirely of his defenses, was
a young man whose face had not entirely escaped
the ravages of the past two years of pain but still
reflected the hope, the ambition, the tenderness of
someone truly in love. Here was the person I
wanted to believe existed but of whom I had caught
but a few fleeting glimpses. He talked of the two
or three remaining operations and the years of
college ahead of him before he could earn an acceptable 
living. But he pledged his life, his strength,
his ambitions to the ultimate purpose of making me
happy. 'Other men may be able to give you more
of the material things than I', he said, 'but no one
else in the whole world could love you as much as
I do.' I said, 'Go away and leave me alone and in
two weeks I'll give you my decision, for I can't
decide now.'"

Reed went back to the army and Harry
remained at a respectable distance, but it didn't
take Norma two weeks to decide. On 31 Oct, 1946
the following telegram was delivered to S/Sgt Reed
J. Webster, 39910794, McCormack General Hospital, 
Pasadena, Calif.: "Two weeks unnecessary
to know I love you always. Chris." So Harry
faded out of the picture.

Norma went back to Washington D. C. and
stayed with her brother Cullen and family and
worked. It was while here that the couple became
engaged and Norma writes of this and of their
wedding later:- "While spending a quiet evening at
home, Cullen, Daryl and the boys having gone on
a picnic, we became officially engaged as Reed
placed a lovely diamond ring on my finger. We
both laughed as he described his journey down to
Orem to obtain my parents' consent. He said he
knew it sounded ridiculous but he had felt at the
time that he should get down on his knees and beg
Dad for my hand. To his relief the greeting had
been warm and permission granted without any
reservations, Mother of course had kissed him
and welcomed him as her future son-in-law. We
<span id="page-941"></span>
set our wedding date for September 20th.

"Sherman and Lois kindly consented to having
the marriage ceremony in their home at Provo,
and Father agreed to perform the rites - it seemed
most fitting that Father, as the patriarch of our
family and a champion of the law, be the person
before whom we pledged to love and serve each
other throughout our lives. Thus in a sweet and
simple home ceremony the evening of 20 Sep. 1947,
Reed and I became man and wife, with just a few
members of the family present, Reed's brother
Ted was best man and my dear roommate Dell, a
bride of only four months herself, was my matron
of honor. The strength of the family name I was
now exchanging for another had been a gift to me
that I was beginning to appreciate more each day.
It had been a force in my life from which I rebelled
at times but which had served to protect and help
me whenever I was in need. I was now so grateful
to be a member of the Christensen family.

"And I was, and am, grateful for my maternal
backgroun., In Mother I had witnessed a conquest
of self far beyond my capability. Hers was an
equally strong influence in my life, but in its
subtlety went unrecognized for many years. Hers
was a truly religious soul, in its self denial - its
unending love and compassion for the downtrodden,
in its willingness to accept the good wherever she
found it. I can think of very few instances in my
life when Mother's needs and desires were not
considered least - and last. From the toil, the
struggle with the poverty of the depression years,
the concern for family before herself, the love she
had for family, relatives, friends and neighbors,
there emerged a person who is the object of love
wherever she goes. No community or neighborhood
in which she has dwelt has remained untouched by
her kindness and goodness.

"Even today, at age 84, almost blind and
very halt, she receives a steady stream of little 
visitors who love to be with her and affectionately
call her 'Grandma'. Letters arrive from all
sections of the country expressing love and appreciation 
for her. Her soul has reached out beyond
her failing body to embrace and comfort and love
<span id="page-942"></span>
the people and beauties of nature about her. In her
example the teachings of true Christianity come
alive. She has a flair for writing but through the
years of toil she has been unable to devote much
time to it and in later years seems to have lost
the desire. Unfortunately, this eldest daughter
has been careless through the years of many
written treasures given by her to me in deepest
love. But may I ever cherish the more intangible
and deeply significant gifts that are mine because
of her.

"Two 'wonderful' years were years of making
quite difficult adjustments. First of all, the time
had come when I had to try to learn how to cook.
For someone who had never prepared a complete
meal, this was no small thing. The results of my
efforts were very obvious by Christmas time and
not entirely commendable - Reed had acquired
twenty pounds and five enormous canker sores."

Reed Johnson Webster was born 9 Aug, 1923
in Cedar City, Utah, the son of John Urie and Mary
Elizabeth Johnson Webster. Since the history of
Reed's maturing years is more or less a history
of his married life with Norma and their joint
accomplishments, we include excerpts from this
as follows:

"I believe my first real association with God
came on the battlefields of Germany during World
War II. Though I had come from a good Mormon
home, I had drifted away from activity in the
church at about fourteen years of age. I had taken
with me, however, the knowledge that there was
a God, and as I witnessed the death and destruction
around me, I felt a close association with him. I
talked with him often, and though I felt most
unworthy I never doubted his presence. Proof of
his nearness came to me in a special way on the
morning of April 10, 1945. In an early morning
attack, as I was running along a railroad track,
a shell from a German M-88 shattered my rifle,
my right hand and forearm, and knocked me several
feet across the track. I was momentarily stunned,
but when my eyes fell upon the gaping wound in my
arm I immediately jumped up and ran back looking
for a medic to dress my wound. Five inches of the
<span id="page-943"></span>
large bone in my right forearm had been blown
completely away, as well as one finger and the
ends of three others.

"As I reached the first-aid station, which
occupied a factory building that had been captured
just that morning, I discovered that a German
doctor had also been taken prisoner an hour or
two before. He volunteered his services, and
within ten minutes from the time I was wounded a
skilled medical man was working on my arm, tying
off the bleeders, cleaning out the wound, applying
a traction splint, and administering pain-killing
drugs. There is no doubt in my mind that this
man saved my right arm. I couldn't help feeling
that God had had a hand in this. A shell had ripped
the front pocket of my jacket completely off without
leaving a scratch, I had been only an inch or two
away from certain death. I was grateful to God
for letting me live, but knew I had done nothing to
deserve the gift.

"By noon that day I had been removed to the
field hospital for care prior to being evacuated to
England. I was transferred from the front to an
English hospital, and from there to Bushnell
General Hospital in Brigham City, Utah. Though
I did not like the idea of being sent to an amputation
center, it was just fifty short miles from there to
my home in Salt Lake City, and I arrived home in
time to celebrate V.E. Day with my parents on
May 8, 1945.

"The doctors at Bushnell General Hospital
insisted that any attempt to rebuild my arm into a
useful limb would meet with failure and that I would
be much better off with a hook than a useless hand.
Being completely opposed to their attitude I finally
managed, after six months, to get transferred to
Dibble General Hospital in Palo Alto, California.
There began the first of a series of twenty-five
major operations necessary to rebuild my arm.

"Those two-and-a-half years spent in and
out of hospitals was a difficult period for me, not
only physically but emotionally, but were perhaps
the most valuable years of my life. During this
time an extremely impatient young man had to
<span id="page-944"></span>
learn patience. I learned from those around me
in the hospitals a real appreciation for all my
countless blessings. And how I learned to love
and feel overwhelming gratitude for my parents!
The rebelliousness and resentment I had held
toward my father melted into a deep pride in this
fine man. No longer did I see him as a naive and
rather stupid man who failed to understand the
world as it really was, but as an honest and chaste
man who avoided the evils of the world because he
knew they did not lead to happiness. Though I had
always loved and respected my mother, her courage
through the loss of my oldest brother, her acceptance 
of my disability and encouragement through
many dark days, her quiet strength and stability - all 
these and many other qualities of goodness made
me so proud to be her son. I began to realize that
even if I spent the rest of my life serving them, it
would not be enough to pay them for the gift they
had given me of being well born.

"It was these same qualities of honor and
decency that attracted me to the lovely girl who
lived upstairs. It was not an easy courtship during
my convalescent leaves. I was not interested in
marriage, with so much schooling ahead, and she
was not interested in me with the kind of life I was
living. It was when I discovered that losing her to
another was a definite possibility that I began to
realize that she represented the type of life and
love I really wanted. The prospect of a life with
her gave purpose to my existence and a great
desire to succeed and to be worthy of her. I consider
my most successful job of salesmanship that
of convincing her that despite my poor record in
school and rowdy army career I would make a good
husband, father and provider.

"The month of September 1947 was an
extremely memorable one for me, I was discharged 
from the army on the 14th, married on
the 20th, and enrolled in college on the 29th. The
latter was to prove the challenge of my life to that
time. I had attended the university for one year
prior to the war, during which time studies never
interfered with my extracurricular activities, and
my grades were an accurate reflection of this - almost
<span id="page-945"></span>
all E's and F's. Because of a difficulty in
eye coordination I had never learned to be proficient
in reading, and as a result had experienced difficulty 
all during my earlier years in school. Since
I had been unable to excel in scholastic pursuits, I
turned my attention to the social, where I had little
problem, and always enjoyed the association of
many different groups of young people, sometimes
in rather questionable activities. One area in
which I gained considerable skill was in mechanics,
woodworking and building, and had it not been for
the now limited efficiency of my right hand and my
determination to achieve an education at least equal
to that of my wife, I would undoubtedly have gone
directly into some mechanical occupation.

"To say that my college degree in business
came after much blood, sweat and tears is no
exaggeration. The first two years were a living
hell to me, and only my reluctance to admit defeat
and my wife's encouragement and patience kept me
from giving up. Gradually, however, as my background
broadened and I got further into my field, I
began to almost enjoy college. It was truly with a
feeling of relief, however, when graduation requirements 
were filled in December 1950 and I was hired
by Masonite Corporation as the factory representative 
in the intermountain area. By now I was the
father of one lovely young daughter, and in February 
of 1951 our second little girl was born. Our
marriage had been truly blessed. Not only were
we much more in love, but our two children brought
greater meaning and richness into our lives.

"After a try at a hardboard fabricating business, 
I turned my attention to an idea that had
come about as a result of an impulse to examine
the possibilities of assisting the young couples in
the neighborhood with their washing problems.
Living within a block of the University, we discovered 
that our home was located on business
property in an ideal location for a coin-operated
laundry. With the value of the property as our
only asset, we embarked on another venture, this
time in the laundry business. This required real
financial juggling and an unbelievable amount of
luck. In recent years I have begun to feel that we
<span id="page-946"></span>
succeeded only because of the Lord's help. With
no money and a $10,000 indebtedness against the
property, we were able to obtain loans during the
next few months in excess of $75,000. A friend in
the building business hired me to supervise the
construction of our building, and a gentleman from
Logan leased the space in the rear of the building
for a professional dry cleaning store and paid $4,000
advance rent. Without either of these we would have
been lost. We were able to buy a fine old home
nearby with almost no money down and moved there.

"The grand opening of our store was on February 28, 
1961. By June of that year, after having
lost $3,000 in three months operation, the owner
of the professional dry cleaning plant in the rear
sold us the business for just $6,000 over what
remained owing on the machinery, $4,000 of which
was the money he had advanced us for rent, payable
at our convenience. Our debts on our new venture
then jumped to $125,000 and I was the owner of a
business I knew nothing about. That we were not
among the 97% of new businesses that failed during
the first year I can only attribute to the guiding
light that came into my life during that time. At
times its presence had been so real to me, it's as
though I haven't been in the 'driver's seat'. With
at least $4,000 per month required just to meet
monthly payments, as well as large amounts
required to make property and sales tax payments,
I have never ceased to be amazed that to date there
has been a way of meeting my obligations. It
would indeed be dishonest of me to take credit for
this, for I have received guidance far beyond my
abilities, without which I could fail, even today,

"Prior to tearing down the old family home
where we had been living for six years, we were
blessed with two more children - a fine boy and a
third dear little daughter. We had been approached
many times by the ward teachers of University
Ward, but still had no interest in church activity.
Our two oldest daughters attended Primary with
the neighbor children, and occasionally Sunday
School. They were extremely concerned over my
smoking and on occasion would hide my pipe. One
evening, after the children were in bed, I was
<span id="page-947"></span>
unable to find it and, suspecting the culprit,
awakened my second daughter and asked her where
she put it. This little girl of nine burst into tears
and pleaded with me to stop smoking because she
loved me and didn't want me to die with cancer.
She was the little one who, at the age of two, while
standing behind my shoulder as I drove to Provo,
bent down and looked into my face with all seriousness 
and said, "We don't like cid-o-wets". I felt
absolutely cheap, completely unworthy of the
wonderful little souls God had given to me, and I.
promised myself, again, that I would give up
smoking.

"In addition to the ward teachers we were
visited regularly by members of the ward Senior
Aaronic Committee. After considerable urging I
accepted the invitation to accompany one of these
men as a supervisor on a San Juan River trip with
a group of Explorer scouts. My problem in quitting
tobacco was licked during this trip. We had also
been invited to join a study group at the home of
Bishop Royal K. Hunt, which we accepted, reluc-
tantly at first, but soon we began to really look
forward to our Sunday evening associations with
the group and our lessons on the Book of Mormon,
and considered it our Sunday church meeting.

"It came time to move out of the ward
boundaries. As a parting gesture of appreciation
for all the work our neighbors had been doing on
our behalf, we decided to give them a little feeling
of success for all their labors by attending church
on our last Sunday in the ward. I even decided to
take in Priesthood meeting. Mingling with these
fine people in these sacred surroundings brought
the realization to us of how desperately we hated
to leave them. We decided to request that our
memberships remain in the ward. Thus began a
most rewarding association in the University Ward,
and a much better understanding of and warmer
relationship with our Heavenly Father and Jesus
Christ. We discovered that the gospel brought a
greater capacity to love each other, our children
and our neighbors, a richer and warmer association 
in our home. We came to love those who were
responsible for our conversion in a way we had not
<span id="page-948"></span>
known was possible.

"A new bishop probably brought to us what we
now needed more - not more strength but the opportunity 
for developing ours through service. In
addition to attending three Sunday meetings, I began
spending considerable time at the church on a
remodeling project. The bishop's challenge in
September of 1961 to be ordained an Elder I gratefully 
but humbly accepted. I continually felt a
gnawing doubt as to my worthiness, however, and
looked upon my entering the temple as an impossibility 
at that time.

"Some two months after my ordination as
Elder, as I was enjoying a fast and testimony meeting 
in a rather detached way, an incident occurred
that completely shattered my composure. Our
oldest daughter, who was shy around adults and
had trouble with stuttering when under emotional
strain, suddenly stood on her feet. She poured out
her love for her Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ,
and for her family; she told of her joy in our
activity in the church. Through her tears she
uttered a prayer that we as a family could be
together in the next world as we were in this. My
astonishment was complete, and her sweet spirit
and the overpowering presence of the Spirit of the
Lord brought a surge of tears to my eyes such as
I have never known before. It was as though I had
been permitted a glimpse into eternity through the
influence of this little girl of ours and it left me
completely overwhelmed. I gained a firm conviction 
of the influence of testimony that day. The
bishop met me outside the chapel that evening and
told me it was time I quit fooling around and took
my family to the temple. This I did on December
1, 1961. I'll never forget my joy as the six of us
knelt around the altar that evening, my three beautiful 
daughters, my fine son, and my lovely wife, all
being joined together with me as a family unit for
all eternity.

"After teaching Course 10 in Sunday School
for approximately six months, I was called to be
Sunday School Superintendent. In the summer of
1963, shortly after his installation a new bishop
called me into his office and asked me to be the
<span id="page-949"></span>
Explorer leader inthe M.I.A. In August of 1964,
after having been in exploring nearly one year, my
wife and I were able to purchase the home at #3
Douglas St. in which we hope to spend the rest of
our lives. Knowing this to be a permanent move
we, with the concurrence of our bishop, decided
to change our membership to the North 33rd Ward,
the ward where we now reside. My wife and children 
changed immediately, but I could not bring my-
self to leave 'my boys' until another year had
passed. In late 1965 I took over the explorer post
in our home ward.

"Then came the call to be Bishop of the North
33rd Ward, which was the most humbling experience
of my life. Had I not been a firm believer in the
principle of divine revelation and inspiration, and
a great admirer of our stake leaders, I would have
seriously questioned the wisdom of this call. I
never face a congregation but what I am overwhelmed 
at the tremendous leadership abilities of
the men over whom I serve. May the Lord bless
me and help me to bring about those purposes for
which I was called."

While Reed got established in his business.
Norma worked, first at the University of Utah and
later for the Union Pacific Railroad where she
started as a vacation relief but soon was on a
regular basis. Here she continued her employment
most of seventeen years with only time out to have
four fine children. Besides, she and Reed have
worked ceaselessly together building their home,
their business and in church service. Among other
responsibilities, Norma served as Relief Society
President and is currently serving as President of
the Ward Y.W.M.I.A.

The couple and their children are truly
"buddies". They have fun doing things together.
They boat, ski - both snow and water - ride horses,
camp out, fish, travel, hike, and swim in the family
pool. Norma's mother, Myrtle, has lived with
them the majority of the last twelve years and has
been a welcome and beloved member of their family
group. Their home is a happy rendezvous for
relatives, neighbors, friends and members of the
Ward, especially the young people. There is
<span id="page-950"></span>
seldom a dull moment at the Websters.

(62) LaFaye Clark (9) was born 19 Sep. 1923
in Goshen, Utah, Utah; died 24 Feb. 1927 in Goshen;
buried Goshen Cemetery.

## George Fern Clark 

(63) George Fern Clark (9) was born 21 Nov.
1924 in Goshen, Utah, Utah, the first son in the
family after four daughters. When he was nearly
five and a half his father bought a lot in Santaquin
and moved the family there. It was here that he
attended grade school and Junior High. He then
went to Payson to High School but only went a year
and a half, quitting about a half year before graduation 
in order to work, since he felt in great need of
money for the extra things boys need and desire,
there being very little for those things at home..

George joined the Civilian Conservation
Corps (CCC) which was activated during the
depression years. During the two years he was
thus employed he worked at seven different camps
in Utah, including the Cedar Breaks and Zion Park
areas. Then he got a job as a night porter in
Walgren Drug in Sait Lake City and then with the
Bamberger Railroad helping to remove ties from
Center Street in Provo. The urges of youth to see
more of the world began working on him at this
point, as they did upon one of his boy friends, and
the two of them took off for Nevada to find work
and ended up in Red House, where they worked in
a smelter until they had enough money to go on in
the Model A Ford they were driving. The two went
then to Reno, Nevada for a little lark and here they
"went broke" and had to work a month and a half to
make enough money to go on to California.
<span id="page-951"></span>

They toured Hollywood in their old Ford and
other points of interest in the Los Angeles area,
and then foolishly spent their last cent at a carnival
and were broke again. They got a job in an orchard
picking oranges. They worked one morning and
were "doing great" when the foreman came along
and found that their speed was due to the fact that
they were picking oranges like they picked apples,
and oranges would soon spoil under those conditions.
They were taught to "cut" the stem of the orange
from the tree instead of pulling the fruit off, which
they then proceeded to do, but found this method
so slow and tedious that they quit at the end of two
hours of this latter. Anyway, they had decided to
hit for home. They made enough on the orange-picking, 
however, to enable them to fill up with
gas and sandwiches for the homeward journey.
But in Scipio in southern Utah they ran out of gas
and food and "hocked" their wrist watches, alarm
clock and a spare tire to get enough of the needed
supplies to get back to Santaquin.

Then George went into the mines with his 
father and worked in the Tintic Standard and North
Lily mines near Dividend, Utah, where they mined
zinc and silver. He had worked here for about a
year and a half when World War II involved the 
U.S.A. and the call came for fighting men.
George wanted to "join up" first thing and planned
to get into the air force, in spite of his mother's
pleading and weeping. But then he discovered
that he was frozen to his job in the mines. This
was a blow!

All his friends were joining up and as
George went to the mines each day he felt resentful 
and like a regular traitor or "scab". No one
could convince him that he was being patriotic by
staying in the mines. This was a period of 
frustration for him. He was determined to get into
the armed services somehow and at last he hit
upon a plan. He simply stayed home from his
work in the mines for about six weeks and it
worked - he was drafted. He was nearing his
nineteenth birthday in November of 1943 when
he left for the war.

George got into the Air Force all right but
<span id="page-952"></span>
not as a pilot. Had he known what was ahead of
him he would have surely ceased his clambering
to be in the armed services and stayed home in
his safer place inthe mines. His boot training
took place at Buckley Field near Denver, Colorado;
his gunnery training of three months was had at an
Air Force center near Las Vegas, Nevada; his
flight training was given at an Air Force Base in
Dyersburg, Tennessee and it was here that he was
assigned to the 92nd Bombing crew of nine in the
8th U. S. Air Force Division. From then on this
crew stayed together and went from Tennessee by
train to Kearney, Nebraska and from thence to
Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, which was their port
of embarkation. They sailed on the troop transport
U.S.S. Wendell L. Wilkie and disembarked at a
port in Scotland and went from there to an air base
in England where they arrived about June 1944.

George was assigned as "waist gunner" on
their bomber and took up his position in the center
part of that plane when bombing missions were
flown. Each member of the crew carried with him,
besides his other equipment and parachute, a small
kit encased in plastic, containing a knife, some
first aid supplies and the equivalent of about fifty
dollars in currency of the country over which they
were to fly. They were strictly schooled in the
tactics they should use in case they found themselves 
shot down over enemy territory. The money
might be useful in buying their way out of some
situations. The bombers usually left England before
daybreak on their missions, with death and destruction 
flying with them not only for their targets and
victims but just possibly for their crews as well,
Yes, this was war!

Bomber crew 92nd started seeking its targets
in July that year. It flew nine successful missions
over Germany during the next less than two months.
About 4:00 a.m. on 13 Sep. 1944 it started out from
England on its tenth mission, which was to be
Nuremberg, Germany, the place where trials were
later held for Nazis accused of war crimes, The
nine members of the crew were in good spirits and
anticipating another successful bombing mission,
But just short of their target, enemy fire caught
<span id="page-953"></span>
them and the plane's one engine was shot out. Then
the Nazis' big guns found the other engine and that
was destroyed also. A signal immediately came
from the bomber's radio to prepare for a crash
landing. This signal was easily heard by the crew
above the noise of the bomber, since each member
wore earphones tuned in for just such purposes.
To prepare for a crash landing meant to remove
one's earphones, go to the small radio room and
lie down on the floor bracing one's feet against the
walls of the room to lessen the jar of a rough 
landing - and await the outcome.

As the crew of the ill-fated bomber heard the
warning signal, four of them complied immediately
by removing their earphones and going to the radio
room. But George felt there was still a little time
left to stay at his gunner's post and apparently so
did four of the others and they were fortunate to be
able to hear the change of orders to "bail out", as
fire broke out in the plane and spread rapidly,
trapping those in the radio room. It was with difficulty 
that George made it to a door and, opening it,
adjusted his parachute and jumped. The other four
started to follow but only the first two of them made
it before the whole plane burst into flames. George
saw their parachutes open following their jumps but
they were later reported to have been straightway
killed by the enemy when they came to land near a
little German town. Others of the crew must have
burned with the bomber, for none of them were
ever heard of again.

Ground fire followed George as his parachute
drifted earthward. Intense pain gripped both his
legs as some shrapnel found its mark. He felt
lucky to land on a smail hill amid some bushes,
but when he untangied himself and tried to stand,
he could not. His right leg, swollen and bleeding
from a jagged gash, was so sore and stiffened he
had no use of it. Following earlier well-learned
instructions he hurridly dug a hole and buried his
parachute so that its presence should not give away
his place of hiding. He tried to cover the tracks,
then he crawled painfully farther up the hill into
the deeper brush, He did what he could for his
wounded legs, which was little, keeping a close
<span id="page-954"></span>
eye and ear open to the surroundings. He felt sure
the foe would hunt for him. By then it was mid-morning 
and he felt weak from loss of blood and
perhaps lack of food. He had not eaten since shortly
after midnight. He tried to relax and await the
unknown fate which surely would befall him. He
thought of home and family - and of his girl friend
waiting back in the "valleys of the mountains". Was
there any likely chance he'd live to see any of them
again?

It was nearing noon of that September day
when he heard voices in the distance - gutteral
German voices giving out many ejaculations he
could not understand. Fear seized him for a moment; 
people were on his trail! The voices came
closer and closer - then he could see human forms
through the bushes. The voice of one, sterner and
more vehement than the others, seemed to be in
charge. George held his breath momentarily and
tried not to move a muscle. Suddenly he was poked
right in the ribs by a searching cane and he knew
his time was up. He crawled painfully out of hiding
to face about twenty German soldiers supervised by
a German Major.

George was immediately made to understand
that he must empty his pockets, which he did, placing 
some things on one side and some on another.
The currency in its plastic cover was placed on the
side opposite the Major, who failed to see it. It
was scooped up right away by one of the soldiers
in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way but who later
gave the prisoner a hidden wink and smile when he
failed to report his "take" to the Major. George
felt that he had perhaps made a friend of a sort,
and this proved to be so later.

The German soldiers administered first aid
to his wounded legs and bandaged the right one which
was more sorely afflicted. Then half dragging and
carrying their prisoner they placed him into a
waiting truck and headed toward town some distance
away. Enroute they drove through a large prune
orchard, and as George tried to stand with the rest
to fill his pockets with the ripened fruit, he was
shoved down into the bottom of the truck again. He
was very hungry! Soon the "friendly" soldier nudged
<span id="page-955"></span>
up to him, however, and slyly slipped him a few
prunes from his own pocket. George found that
some Germans could be human after all. Other
small, inconspicuous favors were given the prisoner 
by his newly found friend before they were
separated.

George eventually found himself in northern
Germany at Stalogluft Camp No. 4, about thirty
miles from the Baltic Sea. Here some 10,000
prisoners were interned by the Germans, approximately 
7,000 Americans and 3,000 English and
Australians. There were five compounds with
twenty barracks each. Most were Air Force personnel, 
Commissioned and Non-commissioned officers,
George was one of the latter. Russian
prisoners of war were forced to wait on these
prisoners and do the "dirty work". George felt
he couldn't complain of the treatment - aside from
the food and sanitary conditions which were terrible!
He went from 160 to 120 lbs. in weight.

In the compound where George was imprisoned
someone had an excellent radio which was disassembled
in daytimes and reassembled at nights, thus keeping
it hidden from the German guards. In this manner
they kept track of the progress of the war and knew
that its ending was drawing nearer and nearer.
They learned that the Russians were gaining ground
on Germany's northern borders and so were not at
all surprised when, in February 1945, the prisoners
were marched out of Stalagluft Camp No. 4, under
heavy guard, and were started marching over
Germany in an effort to escape the Russians as
they fought their way into the country. For some
two months, mostly in the cold of winter, these
half starved and weary men were literally herded
back and forth over Germany, covering some 600
miles on foot during that period. The first few days
of this forced walking the Germans tried to keep the
some 10,000 prisoners together but soon found that
it was safer and more practical to divide them into
smaller units.

Finally, the war nearly ended and according
to terms of the peace, which making was then in
process, the unit of about 1500 American prisoners,
in which George found himself, crossed over the
<span id="page-956"></span>
river Elbe to Halle, Germany and joined the
American troops who had fought their way in to
that point. There was great rejoicing among the
Americans but the German guards who had accompanied 
them were taken prisoners by the Yankee
conquerors. What a thrill it was for George, along
with the rest of his fellow comrades, to get cleaned
up and receive new clothing and uniforms. His
right leg had never healed and had given him quite
a bit of trouble, especially on the recent marches.
This was soon taken care of by experts. For the
first time in more than seven months word was
relayed to his loved ones that he was no longer
"missing in action" but safe and compratively well.
He must have often wondered during those seemingly
endless months why he alone, of all his bomber crew,
had been allowed to live. And we too ask this question. 
We do not know the answer. But knowing that
with the gift of life comes the responsibility of
service, we can only surmise that he yet has greater
missions to accomplish and greater services to
render.

George and the liberated American prisoners
in his group were soon flown to Camp "Lucky Strike"
in France and from there, as soon as troop transports 
became available, were shipped to the good
old U.S.A. His ship docked in Virginia, where he
took the train to Fort Douglas, Utah. Here he was
granted a sixty day furlough. Having been liberated
on 26 Apr. 1945, he was able to arrive home the
forepart of July. What a homecoming! He was
married 10 Aug, 1945 at her hometown Nephi, Utah,
to his sweetheart Blanch Yates (b. 6 Oct. 1926 in
Nephi to Herbert Moroni and Della Louise Willis
Yates). He was going on twenty-one and she was
going on nineteen.

George was granted a twenty day extension
to his furlough so it was not until about the latter
part of September that he went back into the service
and then he took his new bride with him. They went
to Long Beach, California where four large hotels
had been taken over by the Air Force. They were
treated like kings while here and it cost the service
men nothing, except for their wives' meals, those
who brought their wives along. This was indeed a
<span id="page-957"></span>
royal honeymoon for George and Blanche and it
only ended when they were returned to Kearns,
Utah to await his discharge, which took place
21 Nov. 1945.

The couple returned to Santaquin, Utah and
lived with his parents for about six months while
George scouted around for work, which was not
too plentiful during that post-war period. Finally
he went to work in Provo for a "parts" store and
worked for them until 1954, two years in the store
and six years as an outside salesman. Then he
went to work for Central Utah Motor Company of
Provo as manager of parts and service until 1960,
when they went out of business. He returned to
work for Town Supply Co. again until 1962 when
he got a job with Morris Motors where he has
remained until the present (1969).

He and Blanche moved down by the LDS
Hospital in Provo and bought a home there.
Blanche, who had studied beauty culture, has a
beauty shop in their home. For recreation George
joined a bowling league but greatly enjoys the 
out-of-doors while camping, fishing or hunting. Blanche
often joins him in these activities. She says George
takes her on his outdoor trips to "do the cooking"
but she enjoys them. They have a daughter and a
son. Last fall Blanche went back to Maryland to
be present at the birth of their first grandchild.

## Lorraine Clark 
<span id="page-958"></span>

(64) Lorraine Clark (9) was born in Goshen,
Utah County, Utah 14 Nov. 1926. She was three
and a half when the family moved to Santaquin
nearby. It was in Santaquin that she received most
of her formal education and where she graduated
from Junior High. It has been stated that she was
always one of the top students in her classes, if
not the top one. In her ninth grade year she was
honored by being chosen May Day queen of the
school.

She started High School in Payson but quit
early in her first year to go to work, as some of
the other children in her family had done, to provide 
themselves with "the extra things" for which
young people yearn and for which there was very
little money available in their home, although it
was rich in love, sacrifice and devotion. Though
her father was a laboring man with a limited education, 
and the family was large, yet her parents
did all they possibly could to raise healthy, wholesome, 
happy children. Actually, Lorraine and her
brothers and sisters had a wonderful heritage,
having come from purebred English and Danish
stock. All of their four grandparents were courageous 
emigrants who left their homes in their
native lands and came to Zion for the Gospel's sake.

Lorraine had an opportunity to go to Delta,
Utah to work for her cousin, Ada P. Johnson, and
a lovelier person than Ada was hard to find. Lorraine
worked at her place for at least a year, helping with
the house and children. From Delta Lorraine went
to Ephraim, Utah and lived with her married sister,
Vera, and family. By then the war was on and a
parachute plant had been opened in nearby Manti.
Good wages could be made there and they "bussed"
workers from the surrounding towns, so she got a
job there. Vera writes:- "Lorraine came and
stayed with me when I lived in Ephraim. She was
at our home when our daughter Ann was born (18
Sep. 1943). She started working at the sewing plant
in Manti and stayed with me a year or so and quit at
the sewing plant and went to Salt Lake to work. She
had sewed since she was a young girl and was a
lovely seamstress."

Lorraine's sister Tresia writes:- "I was
<span id="page-959"></span>
living with the Hughes Brockbank family in Salt
Lake City and working part time. They needed a
girl and I wrote Lorraine and she came and worked
at Brockbanks' for at least a year. I stayed with
her in their home until I got married (23 Oct. 1945).
Later she worked with our sister Alta at Monson's
Nursing Home."

When a sewing plant, the Barbizon Company,
started business in Provo, Utah in March 1946
Lorraine went to work there. But it was while
living in Salt Lake City that she met her future
husband. Alta introduced them. She was married
the day after her twentieth birthday, 15 Nov. 1947,
in Elko, Nevada to Forest Abel Craig (b. 24 Feb.
1927 in Palisade, Colorado to Forest Oscar and
Annabelle Frances Houseman Craig).

Tresia again writes:- "Abel and Lorraine
built a small home on a piece of property his
parents owned just off Redwood Road and about
Tenth South. Their daughter Kathy was born there
a year or two later. When she was about six or
seven they sold that home and bought a nice home
on 1067 Sterling Drive in the Rose Park area in
Salt Lake. Abel was a plumber and became very
successful.

"Lorraine and Kathy were very active in
their new ward. Lorraine sang in the ward choir
and taught Kathy's Sunday School class. She
gathered Ward Budget for years, She loved working 
in her yard. She sewed for herself and Kathy
and kept her looking like a princess. She was so
proud of this lovely daughter of theirs and so much
of her life was wrapped up in her."

Lorraine started working at Mode O' Day in
Salt Lake City about 1949 and worked there off and
on as a seamstress for about fifteen years. She
became well liked there by both the employees and 
the management. In fact she was shown many
special favors and in her sweet, innocent way
accepted them gratefully yet perhaps with a little
pride, for she was not entirely free from vanity
like most other pretty girls. But through this,
jealousy began to rear its ugly head in the sanctity
of their home.
<span id="page-960"></span>

Through the emotional impact of this
Lorraine became very ill and was forced to give
up her work. She became entirely discouraged.
She was sent to the Mental Hospital in Provo for
treatments. They could find little wrong with her
but sheer despondency. She seemed to gain strength
from the treatments and was able to return home
but failed to find there the understanding and encouragement 
she needed so badly at that time.

In the meantime, Abel was prospering in his
trade. Lorraine was presented with a divorce summons 
she was unable to understand or answer.
Abel procured an easy divorce and soon re-married.
Their daughter Kathy, a sweet girl with a charming
personality, remained with her mother and this was
Lorraine's "star of hope" for the future. But somehow 
Kathy's loyalties began to change. Her Aunt
Tresia writes:- "Kathy turned against her mother
and sided in with her father. I think she was really
led to believe that her mother had done some
terrible sin - but except for being a little foolish
and vain, Lorraine had done no sin."

Tresia continues: - "I have never known a
family who so many people envied and thought they
had everything. I also have never known a family
who sank into the depth of despair as they did.
Their lives have shown me that the material things
aren't what count, and that the only way to find
true happiness is by keeping and living the commandments 
of our Heavenly Father. I'm sure Lorraine desired 
these things. But she had lost her husband and she 
felt that she had also lost her precious daughter 
and she just didn't have the courage to go on."

Undoubtedly with little knowledge of the
seriousness of the act, Lorraine took her own life
at her home in Salt Lake City, 31 Aug. 1967.
Desiring so much the tranquility and peace she
could not seem to find in life, she probably never
looked back once she decided on her course. Who
knows? A lovely memorial service was held for
her Wed. Sep. 6 at 11:00 a.m, in the ward chapel,
at which the Bishop and others who knew her eulogized 
her loveliness, humility, love of humanity
and desire to serve. Her body was laid to rest later
<span id="page-961"></span>
that day by the side of her parents in the cemetery
at Goshen, Utah County, Utah.

In speaking of her, her sister Tresia 
adds:- "Lorraine was one of the best housewives I have
ever known. Her house was always clean, nice
meals cooked. She always kept Kathy clean and
looking like a doll. She loved working in her yard.
Truly she excelled in most of her undertakings.
Her husband said of her after they were divorced,
'In the sixteen or seventeen years we lived together
before our trouble began, as a wife and mother I
could find no fault in her. I could paint any room
in the house, move anything out - stove, 
refrigerator - without cleaning first. Everything was clean.'"

Daughter of Lorraine Clark and Forest Abel
Craig (divorced):

1. Kathryn Anne Craig, born 21 Apr. 1950 in
Salt Lake City, Utah.

## LaMar Christensen Clark 

(65) LaMar Christensen Clark (9) Cousin
LaMar called on me at my home in Provo Saturday 
20 Mar. 1967 and gave the following short
account of himself:- "I was born in Goshen, Utah
County, Utah 14 Oct. 1928. I started school in
Santaquin, first in elementary and then graduated
from Jr. High there. I attended Payson High parts
of three years but did not graduate, staying out of
school at times when work was available. I got
odd jobs with farmers, in the onion and potato
harvests, etc., and herding cows."

His sister Tresia tells of one incident in his
life:- "It was difficult for our father to keep our 
big family in shoes. Clothes could be made over
or handed down - but shoes wore out. One time
when LaMar was about twelve years old he was
herding cows down by the canal and kicking his
feet out over the stream as he sat resting on the
bank. One of his oxfords came off and fell into 
the stream and he was unable to recover it. These
were his only shoes. He was frightened and didn't
dare tell Father, but confided in me. He sluffed
school for a number of days and went barefoot
over to Salem and worked in the potato and onion
<span id="page-962"></span>
harvest until he had earned enough money to buy
himself a new pair of shoes. Not until then did he
tell Father or go back to school."

LaMar continues his story:- "I learned the
value of money early - and the hard way. I learned
to work for the things I wanted. As soon as I could
I got a job working at Ironton, just south of Provo,
and when I was eighteen, in Nov. 1946, I started
working for Geneva Steel of Provo in the open
hearth department. I am still working there after
more than twenty years, but I have had a number
of advancements and am now a crane operator.

"I met my wife, Georgina, when I was attending 
school in Payson. I was sixteen. Two school
friends took me to her home in Nephi and introduced
us. I was impressed and she must have been also,
for we began going together right away. She was
my first real 'girl friend'. We went together much
of the time for two and a half years and then were
married, 1 June 1948, during a wedding party in
our honor at her home ward church in Nephi. The
marriage ceremony was performed about 10:00 p.m.
by Bishop Brockbank.

"We honeymooned in the canyons of southern
Utah, then moved to a home at 355 East 4th North
in Provo, where we rented an apartment. Later
we bought a trailer house in Orem and lived there
for about a year. It was while living in this trailer
house the spring of 1949 that our first child, Nancy,
was born in the Payson hospital. Next we sold our
trailer and rented a home at 455 North 2nd West in
Provo where we lived for three years. It was while
living here that our second daughter, Marla, was
born in the Provo hospital.

"Then we bought a home in American Fork at
950 West Main Street where we lived for about eight
years. It was in the American Fork hospital that
our last three children were born, another daughter
and two sons. In the meantime we began buying a
lot at 396 West 3rd North in American Fork and
on this we had a nice three bedroom brick home
built and moved into this, where we are very 
comfortable and happy.

"My hobbies and special interests are hunting
<span id="page-963"></span>
and fishing, golf, bowling, raising flowers and a
vegetable garden (when there is room); also carpentry 
and do-it-yourself projects. Among other
things I built the garage we had on our first American 
Fork place. I have become more active in the
church recently and now go home teaching. We
like our ward here."

As I looked at this gentle, sweet dispositioned
young man in his late thirties, light complexioned
with curly hair beginning to recede a little, I thought
how much like his grandfather Christensen he was.
Rather short but sturdily built; yes, he was his
grandfather's boy. I thought also that here was a
self-made successful man who was gathering the
good things of life around him - a fine home, a nice
car, a lovely family, and conveniences to make
them happy. He was finding time to work in the
church and to indulge some of his many hobbies,
along with his family.

LaMar took up a new hobby. He bought 
himself a motorcycle. On Sunday July 28, 1968,
after dinner, he felt a little under the weather and
decided to take a little ride to get some air. He
got on his motorcycle and headed toward Alpine. 
Sometime later his machine struck a railroad
track and he was thrown off onto his head. He
was rushed to a nearby Murray hospital and his
family was summoned. But he never regained
consciousness and died that night about 9 p.m, in
the hospital there. Funeral services were held
for him in the American Fork Third Ward chapel
the following Thursday at 1l a.m. and he was
buried in the Nephi, Utah cemetery beside some
of his wife's people.

His wife, Georgina Ockey, was born 17 Apr.
1929, in Nephi, Juab, Utah, the daughter of
Edward Burton and Ida Ann Wilkey Ockey. She 
and their five children survived him, as well as
one brother and four sisters.

Georgina Ockey:

## Kathryn Christensen

(66) Kathryn Christensen (4) has written her
own history:- "I was born on August 21, 1929 at
the Crane Maternity Home in Provo, Utah. Mother
had turned forty-four a few weeks earlier and Dad
was fifty-six. My earliest recollections date back
to the old home in Orem, 1158 South State Street,
where I lived until I was married at twenty-one.
Earliest memories include glimpses of my grandmother
Farnsworth's death as a result of having
fallen out of the bedroom back porch, various cat
and dog pets and the bad ends to which each came
in its own time, the thrill of getting an indoor
bathroom, the rhythm of the twin Dexter washing
machine every Monday morning; but, most of all,
the delight I felt when Elaine and Ted, Virginia
and Dan, or Lois and Sherm would bring their
children 'home'' so I could play with them. For
many, many years I think that Donna Southwick,
Colleen Keeler and Kent Christensen were the
most beloved friends that I had. During these
early years of memory, houses were few and far
between in Orem, and although mother spent hours
reading to me, sewing for my dolls, playing
dominos etc., it seems that I was always hungry
for child companionship. Phil, Cullen and Norma,
the only ones that ever lived in that home, were
all so much ahead of me. Family reunions at the
canyon where all of us children (my nieces and
nephews) stood Sherm and Phil in various tag
games and where that lucky Colleen always won
the box of miniature chocolates for having the most
freckles, were the highlights of my childhood. The
hours and hours that Kent and I spent digging up
"doodle bugs" and hunting for spiders for our
collection will never be forgotten, The summer
or summers that Dan Keeler Jr. spent with us
<span id="page-965"></span>
there in Orem are bright spots of memory.

"Duties of childhood were certainly reasonable.
Working in the garden with Dad, helping
Mother to can fruit and vegetables, occasional
dishes and housecleaning seem to have left lots
of time for what friends could be gathered from
far and near. I did pick strawberries, raspberries
and other fruits for Virgil Cordner, Philo Edwards
and Wilford Stubbs, for this is the way I earned my
spending money. I preferred picking fruit to baby
sitting greatly since my first couple of experiences
at that were so ghastly.

"Grade school memories have condensed
down to glimpses of my teachers, my playmates,
and a general feeling that I did well. Junior high
school was a thrill for many reasons. I met, for
the first time, another child Republican other than
Jeanine Watkins. Other Republicans from the
Lake View and Vineyard areas were encountered
for the first time. It was during this first year in
Jr. High school that I became acquainted with most
of the sweet friends that were to be my dearest and
most constant companions all of the way through
high school: Jeanine Watkins, Marilyn Christensen,
Alene Edwards, Donna Christensen, Myrlene
Smith, Carol Stubbs, Beth Jones, Joan Stewart,
Marie Rohbock, Marjorie Clemens, Pat Yager,
and for a few years, Katherine Tapp. We called
ourselves 'The Terrible Twelve' and for the years
when Katherine Tapp lived in the area, 'The Icky
Thirteen'; but as I look back upon our activities
we must have been the most innocent teenagers
imaginable. Our parents gave us a great deal of
freedom, partly because they all knew each other
and because, in my memory at least, we never
disappointed them. We had such fun times at the
Girls' Home, Carl Young's cabin, the various
school activities and the many parties at our
homes. It became a tradition to have a sleeping
party just before Christmas. The first one was
at our home. All of these girls were active in
studentbody affairs and had such delightful personalities. 
I count these marvelous friends as some
of my greatest blessings.

"In junior high and high school, in addition
<span id="page-966"></span>
to my activity in music, I had the lead in some
school plays; was president of the Junior Organized
Club of Service in 9th grade; a member and
vice-president of the Tigerettes, the pep club;
society editor for the Livewire, the school paper,
and my senior year was editor; Junior Prom committee 
member; and chairman of the Graduation
Committee for the class of 1947. I was a graduate
of Seminary.

"I must have started taking piano lessons
around 3rd grade. Mother and Dad were very
encouraging and gave me every opportunity. I
took from Clair Reid for several years, Melba
Pyne for a short time, Elmer Nelson for a concentrated 
summer, and finally from Carl Feurstner
for a short time. I believe that all of us came to
the conclusion finally that I did develop what talent
I had and that it was not impressive. Somewhere
around the 7th or 8th grade Mother and Dad
noticed that I enjoyed singing very much and sent
me to Allie Clark for vocal lessons. She was the
only teacher I ever studied with so I have no way
of knowing how fine a teacher she was, but it was
a very interesting experience. Opportunities
came often to do all that I had time to do in music.
Mr. E. B. Terry did so much for me. He had me
accompany various glee clubs and choruses and
let me sing some soprano solos in the community
presentation of 'The Messiah' for several years.
It was Mother who was instrumental in the formation 
of a vocal trio with Carol Stubbs, soprano;
Marie Rohbock, alto; and myself singing 2nd 
soprano. Once we got started, Mr. Terry and
especially Stanley R. Gunn, one of our seminary
teachers, saw that we had countless opportunities
to perform. Mr. Gunn was asked to speak at
sacrament meetings often and nearly always
invited our trio to go along with him to furnish the
music for the program. Often we sang at two
Sacrament meetings a week. Up to the present
time I feel that this was the finest singing group
to which I have ever belonged. We were all trained
by Mrs. Clark and must have sung together for
three or more years. I sang with Geniel Larsen
and Birdene Terry for quite some time and this
trio sang with the Mendelssohn Chorus directed
<span id="page-967"></span>
by E. B. Terry. Every place I have gone since
high school I have been involved with music in the
church in various capacities. A sextette in Washington
D. C., of which I was a member, sang
extensively in that area.

"My church jobs started early. I believe
that we were in the eighth grade when Marilyn
Christensen and I traded off being chorister and
organist for the Junior Sunday School in the old
Timpanogos Ward. I may have been still in high
school when I was made Junior Sunday School
Coordinator. I was music director in MIA for
one year and then back to Jr. Sunday School in
various capacities until 1955-56 when, as a married 
woman, our family moved to Hyattsville,
Maryland, where Bishop June B. Thayne said to
me, 'We have three jobs open, which one would
you like?' I'll never forget that bishop! One of
the jobs was ward choir director, which I chose.
Other than directing a Golden Gleaner chorus in
Orem this was my first opportunity to direct a
choir. Since then I have directed them in almost
every ward in which I have lived. I have also
taught Primary for several years and in Palo Alto
taught the fifteen and sixteen year olds in Sunday
School. I became a Golden Gleaner while still in
college. 

"I attended Brigham Young University from
1947 to 1951 where I graduated with a B.A. degree
in elementary education. At first I thought that I'd
major in speech and dramatics since I had enjoyed
being in plays directed by L. L. Terry in high
school. I soon changed to music as a major, then
to English as a major and then, to be practical, I
went into elementary educatio. English literature
is, I suppose, my first love now. While at the
BYU I was a member of O.S. Trovata social unit
and was president of that organization during my
junior year. I was a member of the student council
as senior class representative my last year. I
was awarded membership in Phi Kappa Phi and
graduated with honors.

"I was married on June 5, 1951 to Albert
Charles Todd Jr. the day after graduation. Bert
was a returned missionary from Czechosolovakia
<span id="page-968"></span>
and was finishing his junior year at the Y. He was
a political science major, was a good student and
an inspirational speaker. He was asked to teach
Russian language for our next two years at the Y.
We lived first in the basement of a garage near to
the campus and then moved to Wymount Village.
Albert Paul Todd was born in February 1953. He
was named Albert for Bert, Bert's father, my
father, and Albert Kent Christensen, all of whom
assisted in his blessing. Robert Ord and Melvin
Mabey assisted also. Bert finished his MA in the
summer of 1953. In August of 1953 we moved to
Arlington, Virginia so that Bert could do his graduate 
work at Georgetown University. I taught school
during this time. We lived in the upstairs apartment
above Wynn's Fabric Store on Fairfax Drive in
Arlington. Dixie Reid Christensen, who lived only
a few blocks away, secured our apartment and tended
Paul for two years and in general was our mother
away from home.

"In the summer of 1955 Bert lost his Senate
Post Office patronage job due to the loss of Republican 
strength in the legislature. Because he had
finished his classwork and my salary continued
through the summer we moved for the summer to
Cambridge, Mass., where we lived in Holden Green
and thoroughly enjoyed the association of Kent and
Betsy Christensen while Bert studied at the Weidner
Library. Both Betsy and I were expecting babies
in November (Peter and Ann). In the fall we
returned to the Washington, D. C. area of Kent
Village in Hyattsville, Maryland, because Bert had
taken a position of teacher of Russian History at
Gallaudet College for the deaf. There Gaylen Peter
was born in November 1955. It was while living
there that, through some genealogy work, I located
Bert's father's family in Kansas - all alive except
one brother. Bert and I met Dad Todd in Kansas
where we saw Dad meet his brothers and sisters
after fifty years. I got an amazing amount of
genealogy and it was a thrilling experience. In
June of 1956 Bert changed jobs and began working
for the Air Force as a Russian specialist at the
Pentagon so we moved to Fort Strong Apartments
in Arlington, Virginia. I taught school again and
Bert's mother, Delila Folsom Todd, stayed the
<span id="page-969"></span>
school year with us to care for Paul and Peter
(Gaylen, then). Dad Todd and she were in he
throes of selling their hydroponics plant near
Las Vegas. During this year my own father died
and I returned to Utah for a week or so to be with
Mother.

"In November 1957 Jeanmiarie was born.
About six weeks earlier Peter had rolled off his 
lower bunk bed and had fractured his clavicle.
He had been put in a cast from the waist up. The
next morning Paul (4&frac12;) and I took him for a walk
in the stroller. Paul saw a bird bath in a yard 
and, thinking that it was a water fountain, tried
to pull himself up to get a drink. The mounting 
was rusted and the huge mass of cement fell on 
his leg giving him a bad break in the growth-line
in the knee. Fortunately a service station attendant
saw the accident and helped me get him to a doctor.
It was necessary for him to wear a cast from the
waist to toe on one leg and from the waist to the
knee on the other leg. Mother Christensen rose 
to the occasion and boarded an airplane for the 
first time to come to help me, since I was eight
months pregnant with two small children in casts.
She stayed until spring. On February 14, 1958
Mother Todd died of a cerebral hemmorhage in
Conway, Arkansas, as she and Dad were coming 
to visit us and to see the new baby girl. Dad Todd
did come a little later after the funeral, to fill the
void of Mother Todd's death with this new baby.

"In the spring of 1958 Bert was selected to
go to the Soviet Union for a year of study, by the
University Travel Grant Committee. In preparation 
for this great opportunity the family, with Dad
Todd, moved to Middlebury, Vermont for the summer 
so that Bert could attend a concentrated 
Russian language session. We rented a fascinating
old home with two kitchens, eleven rocking chairs,
two stuffed deer heads and a decorative but real 
wasp nest in the library. Many friends came to 
visit us there. Our furniture had been stored in
Washington D. C., so at the end of the summer
we moved directly to Orem where the children and
I stayed with Mother Christensen while Bert spent
the year studying at Moscow University. It was
<span id="page-970"></span>
with great excitement and anticipation that we
looked forward to this opportunity. I taught
school at the Hillcrest School in Orem. I took
Russian at night for one quarter but found that the
schedule was too demanding to continue. I did get
lots of genealogy work done that year with the help
of Virginia Keeler. Mother cared for the three
children with the help of a lady who did the cleaning
and the ironing. In May 1959 Dad Todd came from
California to help Mother with the children while I
joined Bert in Moscow for a six week tour of the
Soviet Union with him and the other American
students and wives. This had been the first
exchange of students through the University Travel
Grant committee. On the tour we visited Moscow,
Leningrad, Tiblise, Sochi, Yalta, Odessa and Kiev.
We traveled by train, bus and airplane. This was
not the usual tourist journey. We were given considerable 
freedom and all of the students spoke
fluent Russian by that time. On our return trip
we stopped at Warsaw, East and West Berlin,
Paris, and London. After picking up the three
children in Utah we returned to Washington D. C.
where we stayed in Ralph Mecham's home until we
found an apartment in Cambridge, Mass., where
Bert had been offered a two year fellowship at the
Russian Research Center at Harvard University.
At first we lived in an apartment at Sitko's just
off Massachusetts Avenue but after Phil was born
in July 1960 we moved to an apartment two stories
above Pop's Liquor Store on Western Avenue in
Allston, Mass. Our association with Kent and
Betsy Christensen these two years was delightful.

"In September 1961 Bert accepted a joint
appointment at Indiana University in the Slavic
Languages and Literatures Department and in the
History Department. We rented a large university
owned home just off campus. Dad Todd came to
live with us for one year, but health required that
he leave Indiana. During the first year there in
Indiana I ran 'The Princess Playschool' for four
and five year old girls so that Jeanmarie would
have some friends and to help pay for the grand
piano that I had purchased. I had seven little girls
for two hours five days a week. During all of the
time in Indiana it was quite obvious that our
<span id="page-971"></span>
marriage would not survive the strains of changed
goals and ideals. The Russian experience proved
to be disadvantageous to our marriage. During
the summer of 1962 I went back to school in earnest.
Bert was in Russia most of this summer and several
other times during these years in Indiana. I
received much help from the Evan Memmott family.
They, with eight children, were living in a large
trailer house while Evan was obtaining his PhD
degree. During this summer their oldest daughter,
Mary Lee, brought several of her younger brothers
and sisters over to my large house and tended them
and my children while I went to school and Brother
and Sister Memmott typed his dissertation. In the
fall Mother came to care for the children while I
went full time to school.

"I majored in Library-Science. In the spring
I flew to Palo Alto, California for a job interview.
and signed a contract as an elementary school 
librarian with the Palo Alto Unified School District.
I had had job offers for Seattle Public Library, the
University of California at Santa Barbara, public
school at Lompoc, California, and one in Oregon.
I had been invited to stay at Indiana University as
librarian for their new elementary library at their
training school there. I chose Palo Alto largely
because Kent and Betsy Christensen lived there at
the time and the salary offered was exceptionally
good. Betsy and Grandpa Todd found a home for
me and purchased it with some of Dad Todd's and
Mother Christensen's money in June. Betsy and
Dad repainted it and had it all ready for us when
we arrived in August of 1963; I was grantedi a
divorce on August 1, 1963. Bert was in Russia
at the time. I finished my MAT degree on August
llth and we moved the next day. We drove in
convoy with Tom Moon as far as Salt Lake City
where a family gathering at Reed and Norma 
Webster's welcomed us home. A few days later.
I drove on to Palo Alto where we found the first
home ever to belong to us ready and waiting for 
us. Mother remained in Salt Lake City.

"My job in Palo Alto entailed going to five
schools a week to train student librarians, teach
library skill, give book talks and literature
<span id="page-972"></span>
enrichment, etc. In addition there was a great
amount of reading for selecting library materials
for the district. After the first year I had fewer
schools and was one of the co-chairmen of book
selectio. The fourth year I was chairman of
Book Selection and chairman of the Elementary
Library Department. Dad Todd cared for the
children the first year and a half, and Mother
cared for them the next two years. I received
a great deal of help from Mother and Dad.

"These were busy years in Palo Alto and
except for Betsy and Kent and some close girl
friends, especially June Martin, there was not
much time or opportunity for social life since I
taught summer school and took evening classes
during the winter. However, I decided to try to
go to London and Paris as a chaperon with Foreign
Language League with June Martin in the summer
of 1966. In between our planning and the actual
trip, June had been introduced to Dr. Melvin
Mabey (by me) from BYU, a close friend of mine
whose wife, Janet, had been killed a year earlier
leaving nine children. After a beautiful and short
courtship they had been married. June, feeling
obligated to go to London with me and the group
she had recruited, did come for a time; but seeing
that all was going well with our group and being
needed at home, she returned to Provo. The six
weeks in London and Paris with a group of teenagers, 
including Reed and Norma's Kay, was really
a delightful experience; partly because I had met
Dr. B. Delworth Gardner in Salt Lake City just a
few days before leaving for London. (He was a
professor of economics at Utah State University.)
I was able to share my experiences there with him
through letters.

"I had met Del through my bishop in Palo
Alto, John Hopkin and his wife Bonnie, who is a
distant cousin of Del's. Bishop Hopkin had written
Del early in May telling him about me. Although
he had replied that 'his heart was not ready', since
his divorce was very recently granted, when I went
to Salt Lake City in June to leave Peter and Jeanmarie
with Reed and Norma Webster, the Hopkins,
through June Martin Mabey, informed Del where I
<span id="page-973"></span>
was staying. We met at the home of Neal and
Colleen Maxwell and were both immediately
impressed. We had several dates before I left
for California and on to Europe, including a day
or so at Jackson Hole with the Websters and
friends for the Fourth of July. We were both
rather confident that this was a highly desirable
relationship. After writing for the six weeks while
I was away in Europe, several weeks from Palo
Alto to Logan and six weeks while Del was in
Ecuador and Bolivia with intermittent visits
between, the marriage date was moved up from
March to June to December. We were married
in the Oakland Temple on December 17, 1967,
honeymooned in Sausalito, returned to Palo Alto
two days later for an open house at Kent and
Betsy's, and moved immediately to Logan where
we had purchased a house two weeks earlier. Utah
friends and family honored us and welcomed us
graciously.

"In purchasing the house we had in mind
buying one large enough for Del's three children,
who were with their mother, and my four. We
found just the perfect house and furnished it from
the beginning for seven children. The hoped for
but unexpected opportunity to have the three
Gardner children - Naunie Marie, Brigg, and
Bruce - came in mid-February when their mother
called from Reno saying that we could have them
at least for the school year. So nine sat about
our big round (now oval) table that I brought from
Indiana, seven single beds filled the four large
children's bedrooms, and life looked to be very
full and joyful and challenging. How long we will
remain in Logan is indefinite because Del has
several interesting offers other places, but life
seems beautifully full and choice here in this
lovely little valley. The past seems full of great
blessings and some heart aches, but brothers,
sisters, other family, and dear friends have long
since helped to melt the latter away. The present
with Del is so delightful and the future looks so
very bright, I remain awed at the blessings of
the Lord.

"During the late summer of 1967 I was asked
<span id="page-974"></span>
to teach Library Science courses at Utah State
University. The professor who was in charge of
teaching these courses was given a grant to finish
his PhD, and the department of Instructional Media
and Library Science was in need of a person for
one year. Dr. Milton C. Abrams, University
Librarian, recommended me to the department.
Although we now had all seven children with us,
the opportunity to try my hand at this level of
teaching for a limited time seemed worth the
effort. I was made an assistant professor and
asked to teach Use of Libraries and Library
Materials, Reading Guidance, Secondary School
Library Administration, Cataloging and Classification, 
and Elementary School Library Administration, 
as well as to do all counselling of students
with Library Science interests. The head of the
department was Dr. Lester C. Essig whom I had
known at Indiana University. The third member
of the department was Dr. Don C. Smellie whom
I had also known at Indiana U. I was encouraged
by these men and assured that I had a place here
at the University as long as I was here. Their
cooperation and encouragement made it a challenging 
but rewarding and a successful year professionally.

"But for some time Resources For the
Future, an organization of mostly economists
funded by the Ford Foundation, had been anxious
to have my husband, Del, come to Washington
D. C. to do some thinking about what the quality
of life in rural America will be around the turn of
the century. So we have decided to accept this
challenge this year (1968/69). It looks as if it
will be a marvelous year professionally for Del,
and all seven children are anxious and able to join
with us for a year near the nation's capitol."

Kathryn, Del and family left for the Washington D. C. 
area in September 1968. After almost a year of
delightful and successful experiences there
they are now preparing to return to Logan this
September, 1969.

Kathryn's husband, Brigham Delworth
Gardner, was born 7 Sep. 1928 in Afton, Wyoming,
the son of Brigham Delos and Camera Lorean
<span id="page-975"></span>
Hepworth Gardner. His children by a former
marriage are Brigham Ebb Gardner, born 1 Nov.
1952 in Laramie, Wyoming; Naunie Marie Gardner,
born 19 July 1954 in Salmon, Idaho; and Bruce
Barrus Gardner, born 18 Nov. 1957 in Ft. Collins,
Colorado.

## Viola Emma Clark 

(67) Viola Emma Clark (9) the sixty-seventh
and last grandchild of Laurs M. C. and Else K.
Christensen has written a few details about her
own life as follows:- "I was born 21 June 1931 in
the hospital at Payson, Utah Co., Utah. My folks
were living at Santaquin at the time. I was the
youngest of eight children. Mother said I was ill
quite a bit when I was small but since then my
general health has been good.

"I attended twelve years of formal schooling,
first in Santaquin where I spent the first eighteen
years of my life and then in Payson where I
graduated from Payson High School in the spring
of 1949. I also graduated from the LDS Seminary
there.

"I met my future husband, Russell Widdison,
the summer after graduation. Although he went
into the army for three years soon after we met,
I waited for him. Soon after his return we were
married in Provo, Utah 23 May 1952. (Russell
Boyd Widdison was born 4 Sep, 1930 in Heber
City, Utah, the son of Joseph Royal and Ada
Harrison Widdison). We lived here in Utah for 
two years following our marriage and then moved
to Chicago, Illinois for two years where Russell
studied electronics at the DeVry Technical College
<span id="page-976"></span>
Institute. Although he later went into mechanics,
the two years study was certainly not wasted. It
was here that our daughter Darryl was born. We
moved back to Utah and our second daughter,
Cheryl, was born in our home state.

"We have lived in several cities in Utah
during our married life, including Santaquin,
Richfield, American Fork, Bountiful, and are
presently buying a home in North Salt Lake. I
have worked as a nurses aide in nursing homes
and hospitals most of the years since I was
married. I am presently employed at the South
Davis Hospital in Bountiful as an L. P. N. I have
brown hair, brown eyes, am 5 ft. 5&frac12; inches tall
and I hope I am easy going.

"I have taught Junior Sunday School for two
years, Primary for two years and am at present
a visiting teacher in the Relief Society. On 23
June 1961 Russell and I went to the temple in Salt
Lake City for our endowments and sealings and
had our two daughters sealed to us, so that our
family can be together as a family in eternity. My
life has been a happy one and I appreciate the great
heritage given me by my good parents and other
worthy progenitors and will be happy to learn more
of them through our Christensen book. I never
knew any of my grandparents since they all four
died before I was born."

Few of the descendants of Laurs M. C. and
Else K, Christensen have ever taken time to visit
in Little Denmark and fewer still, except perhaps
our family missionaries to Denmark, have visited
North Jutland or Thy where our Danish progenitors
came from over one hundred and three years ago.
This summer, however, Lois Myrup Anderson,
<span id="page-??"></span>
977

Grandfather Christensen's sister Maren Christen-
sen Myrup's granddaughter who has loved Denmark
as I do, went to Jutland to visit the homeland of our
people. She wrote to share her experiences there
with me and I want to share them with you, the
descendants of Laurs and Else K., ina hope that
they may stimulate some of us to visit there
someday also.

Following are excerpts from Lois' stimulat-
ing letter:- ‘'Virginia, I went to Denmark at last,
on a chartered World Airlines plane, leaving June
10th and returning July 12th (1969). I met my
Myrup cousins there and found them to be’very
friendly, lovable people. I hada wonderful visit
with all of them. Hans Peter Myrup took me to
Myrupgard, once the home of my grandfather Lars
Myrup. We hiked over the dunes to see the North
Sea, while he told me as much as he knew of our
common ancestors. We visited others of our
Myrup relatives and then he took me to Thisted
to the Missions Hotel where I stayed for six days
on my own. I wanted to get as much Thisted
atmosphere as I could and I felt 1 could do this
best when I was alone. I fell in love with Thisted !

‘When we crossed the Limfjord 'goose
pimples' came out on me. This was Christensen
and Myrup country! The water even looked
familiar, like I'd seen it before! At Aalborg it
looked like a wide river but at Thisted it seemed
like my own special sea! Denmark wasn't always
as fertile and productive as it 18 now, but I'd like
to think that it was much the same when our loved
ones lived there. Pictures of Thisted (in the
Museum) in the year 1849 show it as a very small
village. Most of the houses were small compared
to the beautiful red-tiled farm houses that now
stand out so picturesquely against the green fields
and the many nearby man-made forests. The
Viking arrow heads, spear heads, stone axes in
the Thisted Museum were not the remains of
unknown Indians! These things were made by our
own ancestors! These burial mounds undisturbed
in green fields! Ancestors 1! We came from Viking
country, Virginia! I saw the evidence all around
in Thisted Amt (Thy), more than in any other part
<span id="page-??"></span>
978
of Denmark.

"Later on I went on a bus down to see Gettrup.
I was alone I thought, but now I don't know, I met
only one family in Gettrup and this in rather an odd
way. The strange meeting in the churchyard con-
vinced me that something or somebody intended for
us to meet. Iwas just coming out of the Parish
churchyard of a lovely old church with its surround-
ing 'grave plots', family plots which were like
individual gardens complete with small hedges,
blooming plants, small evergreens and rose bushes.
I had walked among the tombstones and recorded

names and dates of all Christensens, Kristensens
and Lauritzens buried there.

"As I went to leave I met beautiful, dark-
haired Mrs, Oxlund at the gate. She looked sur-
prised to see me there. I smiled at her and said
‘Good morning', Do you speak English?' She
smiled, shook her head and said, 'Nej'. I then
asked, 'Do you know anyone else who does?! She
looked bewildered so I tried Something else. 'Do
you know Christensens?' I said. ‘Ja, Ja', she
said and motioned for me to get into her car, (The
"Vest Vind' was blowing hard that day). Then she
turned and looked at me questioningly. That was
when I decided to show her my picture of Myrup-
gard, though why I shall never know. 'Myrupgard'
I said, 'the home of some of my ancestors’,
‘Myrupgard' - she stared at the picture and then
at me - 'Myrupgard!' Suddenly she threw her
flowers onto the back seat; (she had come to put
them on her mother's grave), started her car and
took me to see her husband who asked to see the
picture I brought. He spoke English rather well.

"Who sent you to us?! he asked in bewilder-
ment; 'I know this place, Myrupgard; my family
and I have been there many times. It is owned by
my brother-in-law, Did he tell you to come to us?'
'No, no' I said emphatically, Staring athim. 'I
just came to see Gettrup because my grandmother
was born near here. Mr. Oxlund, is there anyone
else in Gettrup who would have known about Myrup-
gard?' 'Nej, Nej' he said, as excited as I.

‘Lam
the only one. '
<span id="page-??"></span>
|

"I met your brother-in-law' I said, ‘but he
honestly didn't know I was coming down here. I
just can't believe this happened as it did. In five
minutes I would have left the churchyard when I
met your wife at the gate - just like someone
wanted us to meet!' I wonder now, Virginia, if
the Oxlunds felt the spiritual implications of our
mutual experience as much as I did. They felt
something - I saw it in their faces as we stared
at each other. They would not let me go. I spent
the rest of the day until my bus was to leave (at
3:30 p.m.) with them. Mr. Oxlund took me to see
the only remaining Christensen in Gettrup, but she
was not a relative. He also contacted the oldest
man in Gettrup who remembered a Christensen
farm there but the family had all moved away.
They took me to see the Parish Priest but he
seemed rather reluctant to look up records when
I wouldn't even give him a date as to when and
where the last Christensens left Gettrup. Both
Mr. and Mrs. Oxlund looked a little perturbed
when I told them I was a Mormon and lived in Salt
Lake City; but they were lovely people and very
soon we were talking like old friends.

"Virginia, Gettrup had many beautiful farms
but the town itself was very small. There was a
store, a cafe, a drive-in with its familiar 'Is Ees',
meaning ice cream, milk nickles, cones, etc.
There is also the lovely old church I mentioned.
Actually though it is a beautiful place ! I think
Maren must have wept many times remembering
the green, rolling fields, the Viking mounds, the
Limfjord, the 'West Sea' and the low hanging clouds
drifting in from the ocean. But perhaps it is
greener now than it was in those days.

"It was a wonderful day! Danish homes are
unbelievable clean and beautiful and Mrs. Oxlund's
was particularly lovely! There were draperies
patterned in Danish blues and sill length curtains
of Danish net bordered in a lacy design. Every
piece of furniture, every painting, rug, clock,
etc., seemed to have been chosen because it fit
perfectly into the place or space where it stood
or hung. ‘You love blue', I said to her, looking
around; for even the china on her dining room table
<span id="page-??"></span>
980
had a 'blue' picture of sea gulls flying.

"Denmark and sea gulls - how they do go
together! These are smaller gulls than ours,
some with black heads and dark grey wings,
time I looked up I saw gulls flying - and at M
gard the larks winging overhead,
stant cheery little song high above the grassy dunes
as cousin Hans Peter Myrup and I looked out towards
the sea, These are pictures I shall cherish always!"

THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF
ENGLAND AND DENMARK

(Special permission to reprint this material
in our Christensen book was given in a letter from
Ib Permin of ANDR. FRED HOST AND SON of
Copenhagen, Denmark, publishers of A History of
The Kingdom of Denmark. ) —_

The sovereigns of,England can be traced back
considerably further than those of Denmark, but
then during the early centuries England was divided
into several kingdoms of varying sizes, Alfred the
Great was the first to stem the Danish onslaught,
and after him followed a number of

Saxon kings.
In 975 came Edward the Martyr (slain by Danish
Vikings).

Listed on the following pages, from this
Edward onwards, are the kings and queens of
England side by side with those of Denmark, This

may help English readers to get their bearings in
Danish history,
